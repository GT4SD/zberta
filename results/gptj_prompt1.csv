0,I Need To Know Your Exchange Rates.,Considering this utterance: I Need To Know Your Exchange Rates. What is the intent that best describes it?,"I need you to know my exchange rates so that I can get the best price from you
-or- I need to have the prices in front of me so I don't make mistakes during a trade
(I've heard people say they can't imagine doing business without a computer.)
The difference here is that in the former the main action is to be taken by the other party, while in case you are doing a lot of trade you might need some sort of a ""cheat sheet"" which would contain all the information about the currency conversion.
So in general the first one is about making a good impression on the client, the later it is used in business, I'd say..
Any other suggestions, and maybe some examples, would help. Thanks in advance.  
P.S. Please note this is not about shopping! I am asking about business. I hope I didn't mislead. :)
[UPDATE]
@T.E.D. is probably referring to a different scenario. What he means is: ""I would like to exchange currencies with somebody, but I prefer that you know how much your currency is worth to me, so you can give me the most advantageous rate"".
Also, what he said about knowing rates is true for countries that are not members of the SWIFT. For example, let's say that USA and Russia have an arrangement so their currencies are exchanged freely, as the currencies of USA are floating against the euro etc. The situation is different, for example when the countries of Euro Zone are trying to get rid of their debts, they exchange their money at the same rate, because the Euro is fixed against all other currencies."
1,What Exchange Rates Do You Offer?,Considering this utterance: What Exchange Rates Do You Offer? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Does it express a negative or a positive sentiment?

I've seen it used in conversation and on social media. And there seems to be a general misunderstanding of what the correct response should be.
A couple of examples:
On Twitter, people have been tweeting about how much they dislike the exchange rate offered by some online retailer. Their tweets range from complaints to threats of leaving the website. Others (including the retailer's customer service) have replied with a ""we'll make it up to you next time"" message, which sounds to me like ""Sorry for the inconvenience!"".
Some comments on forums, etc., say ""you shouldn't complain when the rate is good"" or just ""don't whine"".
And the most common usage is a request for an ""exchange rate"". This implies something more than offering money, and I've not managed to dig up a definition of its correct usage in any of the dictionaries I checked. 
For me, if it isn't an insult, it's very close to an accusation of theft (as in if you offered me money now then I would be stealing from you).  I have heard it said as a polite request, such as ""I want an exchange of xxxx for yyyy"".  But then what is it expressing? Are people really just being polite?  Is the request really a simple, friendly request to make an arrangement with the other party? Or is there some underlying message in the expression that I am missing? What does it communicate? (Note that it doesn't matter whether these people know each other or not)
(Note: I'm not asking about ""what is an effective way to express yourself when a response is expected, or when responding to a conversation"". I know what's required of me. This question is asking what it means to say something.)
Update: Here is one usage I can think of that may be the source of my confusion. I was reading in a book about a woman who was being harassed, but she was getting nowhere so she decided to do something different. She went to the man who harassed her and she told him, ""if you want to stay with this woman, you'll pay me $20,000"". The expression was used literally and seemed to convey the sense of her asking him to pay her a fee, as I understood it. The woman's friend said she thought the phrase was """
2,How Did You Come Up With Your Exchange Rates?,Considering this utterance: How Did You Come Up With Your Exchange Rates? What is the intent that best describes it?,"1. To describe the origin of a set of currency exchange rates.
2. The source of the currency value of an economic unit. For the purpose of this post, I will refer to the latter as currency source. (Wikipedia)
3. Exchange rates are calculated based on currency sources. We can also calculate the exchange rate based upon the price of two commodities. If it is a single item, then we are dealing with a commodity price. It could also be considered a price index. In this case, we have to deal with it as a currency. As this is not directly relevant to this discussion, it will not be covered here. I am only interested in the case where there is currency and currency prices. Let's call them currency price and let's use these terms interchangeably and synonymously. So, when there are currency values, the term currency pricing or currency rates is used in some sense. And when currency or exchange prices or rates do not exist, that means that the two sides are trading in a foreign currency, such as the Euro. Then, there's no reason to have prices in this currency since they are not traded in it. There's not even a need to know what it means, because you can't go trade this stuff. Currency pricing is then, in that case. Now, back to currency: The two currencies in an exchange. They could be, say, dollars in one currency vs. yen in another currency in order to create the FX, foreign exchange, and the pair is known as an FX pair. Here is an example:
Euro, U.S. Dollar
This is just a sample, as there could very well be one of thousands possible currency pairs out there. Each currency pair has its own exchange and price rates for each side. These exchange or pricing rates, also known in FX circles as exchange spread or simply spread, are typically expressed in percentage terms, although they may be quoted in points. An exchange quote is quoted by quoting the bid price, usually in dollars, for a given side of exchange versus the ask price in yen which is also the quote for the same exchange currency side that is bought when the buyer is looking to buy the other currency (i.e. there was no bid-ask spread).
So, what are those currency quotes worth and when is it appropriate to use it for trading? Let me start by"
3,Where Do You Guys Acquire Your Exchange Rate?,Considering this utterance: Where Do You Guys Acquire Your Exchange Rate? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What are you getting yourself? Or your group? When you hear a new piece of music do you automatically think what instrument is on it or what part it’s used in or do the words tell you? For most people if a song says “Oh God” they can assume it will be slow, depressing and depressing in more ways than one. However, if you had an audience of a thousand people and said ” Oh God,“ then you would be singing a different tune than if there were 2 or 3 people.

The same applies with the people you talk to. In fact if anyone in a small social group tells you that they have some special knowledge to impart to you or they‘ve got a solution to a problem or offer some advice, they are in essence telling you ‘I am better than you at this, I am smarter and I‚Äôm not just saying it to be nice, but because it is true.‏ It is not true that the only way to improve in this area is practice and practice practice. The only reason that that would have any value is that there is something wrong with your approach. It isn‟t just the fact that you need to practice, it's that practice alone isn't going to cut it. You need an alternative approach
. So what is it that people get their knowledge from? They get it from their peers. That is why they get together, so that their social circle can give them knowledge that is better and more comprehensive than their own. This is also why we have the idea of an expert or expert in our communities and why the local community is a great place to go to get new knowledge. They are the experts in their field. Why go get all the knowledge and wisdom in the world from people in New York when you have thousands in your town?

4,How Do I Find The Exchange Rate?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Find The Exchange Rate? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it an opinion about a particular exchange rate or is it a command, question, or request? It depends on how the person speaking wants his statement to be read.

The question that must be answered is what is your goal. If the goal is to know more about this particular currency, then the best way to accomplish that goal would be to use the Google or Yahoo! Search Engines. This is because Google and Yahoo are search engines and they will search the web, in general, to find this exchange rates. When using the search engine to locate an exchange value, do not limit the results to just one exchange web site since they can all have different exchange ratios. Instead, use all the available search tools and limit your search to the top results. Also, make sure to search multiple countries and currencies, because a specific country, such as Germany, may exchange currencies of other countries, but they may not always have this rate posted on their web sites at all times. For example, you may use a search site to look for a US dollar to US Dollar exchange, and the rate may be displayed in a different currency on the US web. Therefore, be careful to make your searches broad enough to cover all exchanges that may have the currency of interest. Once you find the exchange sites that show the rates that you want to compare, it can then be used in the next step to obtain the required exchange. You may now have found all you need to exchange your money into this other currency. The next part of the process involves using another tool to convert your selected currency into the foreign currency you are looking for. Now you can use that to determine the value and exchange it. All of these steps are covered in more detail in this book. However, before you do that, let’s talk about the terms, currency and money. I”ll also discuss a little more in depth about exchange values. Currency Terms
What is a Currency?
A currency is money used for exchange to other currencies or money as a unit of account. A unit or unit may vary by the country or nation in which it is used. Money is currency in that form, which is something that can be exchanged for goods (including services) or services. It has value for some people and not the same value to others. Examples of money are U.S. Dollars, Euros, yen, Rubles, etc. In"
5,What Are Your International Exchange Rates?,Considering this utterance: What Are Your International Exchange Rates? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I would assume it is to teach people about exchange rates.

The way I write it, I feel like I'm teaching them how to make a pizza. Sure, that is a common thing to do, but the question is: is it a meaningful lesson? How important is an average pizza to the reader's life (e.g. is that a question that I should be answering)?
And if it isn't a good lesson, then what are the words and phrases that can be used instead?
I guess these are all subjective, so I'll have to ask what others think. 
Thanks. (edited for more specific question)
Edited to add more about what I think the lesson is (i.e to have a more focused question).
To explain what isn’t clear from my explanation, the sentence I‘m questioning is from a list of questions in the back of a popular textbook in international economics. It‟s asking about international exchange. The textbook is by David S. Landes and is entitled The Wealth and Poverty of Nations. I found the questions using google, searching for „what are international”. There's a lot more I could be searching, since the textbook lists other topics. This is why I used the phrase in question. If there isn' a better phrase to replace it with, feel free to point out what you think it should say. :)
Thank you for all of the help. Again, appreciate the time put into helping me. Have a great day. :D
Also, thanks. For the comments. They really do help to think about things a bit differently. Thanks for your help and the responses. Really appreciate it. Thank you. ^_^
Edit: Thanks to all those answers. My apologies, for not checking this site and answering this more directly. And again, thank you to everyone that answered, answered comments, or just commented. You all were helpful in helping with the answers or comments that made me rethink what the meaning of this sentence is. Also, to those that helped just comment on the answer, it helps me immensely. A good example of that are some of those comments on @user1022. He's right. Just leave it be. Don't comment just to reply. Leave the comment be in this case. Then maybe someone will see it and read what he posted, and help him out"

comment #2 I'd suggest changing ""exchange rates"" to the plural verb ""change.""
""Exchange Rates change regularly"" is a grammatical sentence, although it's not the best possible sentence.
-sounds good?-
Nov 30 '10 at 22:32

What's the verb tense? Is this the correct sentence? I'm guessing that ""regularly"" means ""at regular intervals"", but I can't be sure. This sounds strange to me, but then again I don't know enough English. :-)
Thanks. I appreciate your answer. How do you know it is correct? You know, I read it but it sounds weird to
me, so I want to hear your thoughts. –Nov 9 '13 at 12:26

If you mean “change regularly” (or ‘at irregular intervals’), then of course you‘re correct. -s sounds good to my ears (though it does seem a little odd to use „exchangers“ for the ‚exchanging party‚, since they‛re a pair of people and we‹re talking about ‹an exchange› between them) – but that‖s a matter of taste -Nov 10 '14 at 17:35

I agree with @sds that the exchange rate is often used as a noun; however, when discussing an event, one does not say ""How often does the rate"" but rather ""how often has the price"" or something similar. Also it has been my experience that when an exchange
rate is used in an actual exchange, the rates are listed as part of a statement rather than an isolated ""sentence"". –sDec 11 '15 at 19:55

@m-w.c You're right; that is not a correct usage of English (at least in my country). You will always hear ”How long does it take?„, for instance. It is always a question. And that's exactly
what we mean; a sentence that does"

What is the intent that best describes it?,"Does the writer intend to discuss how the Federal Reserve calculates the rate at which it changes the price of U.S. Treasuries? How are exchange rates calculated?

Exchanges
Calculating exchange
rates
A simple calculation is used here to determine the value of money
that is sent or received in exchange for money, usually
other money or some other form of
goods
or services.
When people say that a price is determined by an exchange rate, they
are usually not talking about one-for-one exchange; for
example,
the exchange ratio of one US dollar to a pound sterling is a bit
higher (1.50) than its
equivalent ratio, $1:1
(i.e., one dollar in
American currency equals exactly one pound in British currency),
but that doesn't mean the
actual value
of a US
dollar and a Canadian or Australian one is exactly equal to each, or
even that they always
rise in value to one another, as the following example shows."
9,What Are Exchange Rates Based On,Considering this utterance: What Are Exchange Rates Based On What is the intent that best describes it?,"In this article I will attempt to explain the different ways to use exchange rates in your business and give you examples of how they've used them in practice.
1. Exchange rates are used by traders to price foreign currency
2. It can be used to make price comparisons for products to foreign nations
3. For foreign firms to estimate their international profit margins
4. An alternative to the FX rate is to base it on a currency index. This is a simple way to compare the relative strength of one currency in relation to another
5. Currency futures are contracts where the buyer agrees to a purchase price and the seller agrees that that rate will be paid upon delivery. We talk about these contracts in more detail further down. 
6. FX pairs are pairs of currencies that are often traded against each another. USD/Yen is an example - US Dollars are sold for Yen. These can also be currency indices (see below)
7. A currency basket is one which represents a group of other currencies - USD, EUR, ZAR, CHF. Each currency holds a specific place in the basket. In practice it's often used for a broad index to represent many other major currencies. The currency can then be priced in one of those currencies to arrive at a 'true' rate. You can read more about the concept of the currency pair and currency baskets on page 7 of this document. They are very commonly used in foreign exchange
8. Spot is when you need to buy/sell a foreign FX currency. If you have an FX position you are required to hold on to it until the rate changes to your advantage. Often there are minimum sizes which you must have when buying on the spot market. On the buy side you can get better prices when the size of order is larger
9. Forward is where you buy or sell foreign money in advance of its use. That's right - you want to profit BEFORE you use it. Most businesses use forward currency contracts for this. (It's usually better to wait until a price has been agreed before selling) The forward market is different from a spot FX contract which is often only used where currency exchange has to be carried out
10. Settlement is used when money is exchanged for real currency and is usually done in two steps. At the time of conversion you will need a quote for the money you wish to exchange and you'll be given a quotation for it -"

There are many ways to approach this and many approaches to the answer. But I suggest you to start with some specific questions. Which of these questions do you think are necessary to answer the question? 
If there is only one, then I think you should be able just ask for that one. If two or three of them have the same answer, or they might be the most essential, you could combine the questions into a single question."
11,What Are The Most Current Exchange Rates?,Considering this utterance: What Are The Most Current Exchange Rates? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The correct answer would be: A question asking for clarification of an unfamiliar term or phrase.
As such, your use of it is grammatically incorrect, and I will explain:
What Are is a question that is used to ask about the subject. As such the form What + [thing] Are [verb] +? would not make any grammatical sense. 
You should therefore use a form of the verb to be rather than the question form (what + are [verbs]):
Which of these are the current exchange rates? -> The correct sentence
I am also unsure of why you chose the word current. Is it just to show the correct verb in order to make your question less ambiguous?"
12,Can You Explain Your Exchange Rate Policy To Me?,Considering this utterance: Can You Explain Your Exchange Rate Policy To Me? What is the intent that best describes it?,"(a) An Exchange rate policy describes the exchange rate regime for a specific country at a particular time (e.g. The Japanese Yen has been fixed at ¥108.00 per US Dollar since 1985).
b) The exchange of money from other to a certain currency is done for various reasons.
c) A currency policy is a statement of the government’s position on monetary policy (i.e., the central bank‘s target interest rates at different time periods). 
d)  A central exchange or currency rate is defined as the rate of exchange for one currency as compared to another currency.

  4. Given the definition, which of these statements about exchange rates is true?

 a) In the UK, you will receive an exchange receipt from the airport if you exchange $2000 on arrival on your first day. (True)
 b) All currencies of equal purchasing power are exchange at an equal exchange ratio. It means the same amount of currency will buy you more or less the amount as another. This ratio is expressed as a percentage like; US$ 1.50 = GBP1.40. or ¥1 = ¥20.01
 (False)

 c) It has become a common practice for companies to use a floating exchange value to facilitate trade with the foreign market. An exchange control system is used to control the fluctuation of this currency by monitoring market transactions. In an overvaluation or undervaluations of currencies, it is called a balance of payments problem. A country‟s international trade balance is affected by foreign debt and current and future trade. When trade deficits occur there is always a resulting rise of a domestic currency‡ in value. These imbalances usually are a result of changes in the relative value of different currencies or the balance in international payments. Exchanging the currency between countries may be"

A statement of opinion, or a statement on a particular topic? This kind of ambiguity is often not obvious.

In fact, it’s not even a question, which means it lacks a subject. “What is a good way to ask for that?” is more natural. But the question can often be more precise. It can be about the way the user would like to get the answer. A question about a general topic does not allow for much choice, but there is always something the other person can choose from. For example, the request can say ‘a good‘ vs. asking for a ’best“or a suggestion can use:
„Could you suggest a method? I prefer to not buy in bulk, because it is very inconvenient to do if the items are sold in small packs.‟
The request is not as specific, and the suggestion does allow some choice. So, in that example ‚a method‛ can refer to ”a suggestion to a product‖, a price, where you can buy it, etc."

What I have done here is that I asked two very different groups of students: First, I gave a lecture and then I had another lecture. This time, the students had a free period in which they could work on whatever task they chose with the teacher.
In the first lecture, we were talking about the economic consequences of the recent global financial crisis, but we also had to deal with some economic concepts that were difficult to grasp for the general population. I explained the difference between demand and aggregate demand. But I failed to tell them that the aggregate supply can also serve as aggregate (market) demand, which is not true if you look only at a single sector. Therefore, it would be a good opportunity to explain this. So I decided to teach them a lesson about aggregate and market demand by giving the question to them. Of course, a lot of them were not able to solve it. It also happened that some students asked about this during the break. One of our exchange students, who is a financial journalist, could not solve even this question. However, as you can see, this did not prevent other students from solving it in a very convincing way:
First, they looked at the supply of money: the stock of cash held by people at home and in banks. And they did this in an economic way. The demand for money, in terms of goods and services, is equal to its demand in the labor market. As the economy grew over time and more and cheaper money was injected by banks, there was more money for people in need to spend. When people were asked what they had bought in exchange for their money before the crisis hit, for example, to show that demand did increase in real terms, these were mainly goods like homes, cars, and consumer electronics, while services such as health and insurance were rarely mentioned. In addition, if we take a look at household spending, you will observe that most spending is of private consumption, i.e., consumption of tangible goods. A big proportion of this, of course is related to the housing bubble that burst. We can even see this clearly if one considers spending in different industries. For example in 2008, spending was about equal in private and household consumption in healthcare, transportation, education, finance, insurance"

18,What Currencies Is An Exchange Rate Calculated In?,Considering this utterance: What Currencies Is An Exchange Rate Calculated In? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This is not the same thing as saying: ""I will exchange my US dollars for your Canadian dollars."" This exchange rate calculator is for the exchange of currencies between different nations, or different currencies within a single nation.

In my example of the two currencies we are exchanging, I will assume that a Canadian dollar is worth one American dollar, and a U.S. dollar will be worth $1.00 Canadian. If you would like to change the amounts and values I have used, then that is your choice of course. All you need to do is substitute the values you use into this simple equation of exchange. To calculate the actual exchange (or foreign exchange) rate, you have to figure out how many dollars or pounds, euros, yen, etc., you will receive or give me in exchange for one U S dollar. I suggest using the currency exchange websites for this. There is no point in having this currency conversion calculator for calculating foreign currency to use in your business, if you do not first know how much those currencies are worth. You can find those websites at www.xen.com and www....
If you were to exchange the Canadian US Dollar, that would mean that I would receive $2.50 Canadian, in my possession (for a total of $3.25). I need $10 American to get $12 Canadian ($10 Canadian and $ 2.5 U s) Canadian Dollars. We have the answer here: Canadian exchange rates, but you may find it easier to have an exchange website, such as www....., do the conversion for you, for a small fee. The website can also be used as a resource where you can check on Canadian rates. In my case, it would be easy to visit www... and click on Canada. That will tell me if I want to receive two Canadian in place of my $25 American. Of course, $0.75 will take the place for my Canadian $ dollars. Another thing you should do here is enter the amount of British pounds that you are going to give away (in my exchange scenario, this would make the British pound worth 5 Canadian cents), and enter what that British currency will cost you in Canadian money. This way, a quick comparison will give you the best exchange at any time. Once you know the prices for each currency, the calculation is easy. For my American US currency we would calculate it like this"
19,Where Do You Get Your Exchange Rates From?,Considering this utterance: Where Do You Get Your Exchange Rates From? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I agree with what the author said, but I don't agree that ""I know there is a reason"" is enough for an answer. The author states that the reason for the quote he chose was that he knew that there was a purpose and ""there is none"" for it. This is not even a question because the answer is obvious. If I say that I get my rate for a loan from a particular bank, I am not telling a story about ""what is it like to get your money from X"", but rather I'm just saying ""that's what I have to pay to borrow my money"".
But you could also say where I got the information from (i.e. the bank) or what it means to me or whatever. ""Why did I choose that quote? Because I believe it's a good way of expressing that it doesn't matter what kind of information you are getting from your source, it is still only information."" (I'm assuming you're not using this exact sentence in the example, of course.)
The author should have chosen a different quote, because it makes his point even weaker.
Edit: I also want to add that your original point still stands even though I changed some of what you wrote because I think that what matters is less whether or not the story is complete in itself and more whether the speaker's intention is clear. And as for your example being weak, you didn't really answer my question. Yes, the original quote is better, since it gives the impression of a complete and complete story, which I understand the argument to be about. You didn’t, however, explain the reasons for choosing that one quotation, and I still feel it has an argument against it as it‘s incomplete. But if I understood you correctly, what makes the difference is that you thought your answer was complete. For that, your own example is sufficient, as long as you explain how it would be weak to have not given all the relevant information."
20,What Is The Base Of The Exchange Rates?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Base Of The Exchange Rates? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it about the base of the exchange rates that is used to compute the current exchange rate of a given country? Or is it the rate that the country has when the currency is in a free float and a country does not impose or enforce the use of its currency?

This is what I have done in my previous post. I took the first question, the one that describes the intention behind the statement, and have translated it into the second sentence.
I was quite satisfied with my translation, because the structure of this sentence is quite natural. However, I am still not completely happy. If you can help me figure this out, that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
-Shannon
P.S. The first three sentences that start with an “a”, are not necessary. So they can be deleted. They just repeat the original sentence and make it a bit more difficult to read. 
Thanks,
Shan
EDIT:
After further discussion in the comments, here is how to translate the entire piece of writing into a more fluent sentence:  (It was not clear in Shan’s original posting that he was talking about two countries.)   I would not translate ‘the base‘ into ’ the underlying base,“ because ” the ‑ ‐ base does have a precise meaning, as an underlying or underlying factor or basis. In the sentence „If you were to take the amount of money you are worth (on the basis of your country‟s currency,)„ the word currency means ‚ the value of‚ or ‏‰ the money in relation to other money‛. (You might be worth more or less than that.)
Also, ‍ I agree that if the author wants to say that †exchange rate ‹is derived from an exchange ‖ rate› or from a ›ratio‹, they will say so. He just said  that the countries  have ″‖ exchange rates ‬‮.‭
So I‏-‫I think the most appropriate way to describe the two base rates would be ※‍the two  ‬rates‗ of ․ exchange‒‐‥‱′rata"
21,What Exchange Rate Do You Use?,Considering this utterance: What Exchange Rate Do You Use? What is the intent that best describes it?,"If I were being honest, as an exchange rates specialist who has seen a dozen new exchanges enter the market and exit, there are times when that question is a bit of a stretch.
There were a few things I noticed about the question:
1. It’s vague. How much are you willing to spend for an item? In the real world, this isn‚Äôt just a financial concept, but a concept that involves the value of your time. So you can‛Æ¸ì¨ spend as much or as little time getting the item you‡Ð¦re searching for; in other words your willingness. But the reality is that you could spend an hour searching and find nothing, while someone who spends the same amount of time could make a much better choice. Or maybe it”Ëœs the time you want to invest, not the amount? What currency is it that we use here? The USD? Euro? Yuan? GBP? JPY? How do we translate the concept into an effective currency? This leads into my second point: 2. The real currency isn't the currency itself but its value/worth/use. Currency is just an accounting of value and not always of worth, it's an account. For example there is no accounting to show USD are worth more than other currencies. You can trade one currency for another at an agreed price, or you may trade USD for a specific amount in another currency or even the ability to exchange at some point in the future. We don't actually care who gives the most currency, because ultimately its worth is irrelevant and we all use USD or some other currency in our everyday life, so we're just talking about using the best currency. If I had to put a real value on it I‘d say: if you don“Åt use it to pay for your daily needs, then you haven't spent it, nor have you made the exchange and you have no right to complain about your currency's weakness. This is especially true of the United States with the constant inflation of money, which will drive any currency to be less and less attractive. There's no value to holding money that can be spent, and it can only become more valuable by trading. I don' care how much an individual USD is worth in your pocket"
22,The Exchange Rates Are?,Considering this utterance: The Exchange Rates Are? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I had a discussion with someone yesterday. The subject was the exchange rate between British Pounds and US Dollars. We had this conversation, and I will summarize it as best I can.
In the US, we have an economy that works in many different ways. Some people buy houses they can not afford, some go to college when they have no interest in going and some even live on the street. There are many causes but I would say that the main reason why we don't have a strong economy is that there is a lack of job creation. As such, there are a lot of people who have jobs. They go through their entire lives working at their current employment and their lives are consumed with paying the bills, keeping up with the mortgage and the insurance policies and trying to buy the right groceries and make sure they don;t go hungry. I have worked in this industry for over 14 years and it has been a roller coaster ride. In the 14 year span, I believe we went through 2 recessions and we had two stock market crashes. So the stock exchange has not always been as robust as it is now. With more companies that used to only exist in your head, like Dell, they were able to make it so that you did not have to go into debt to purchase one of their products because you didn't make too much money and you couldn't afford it. This is why when someone tells me, ""we have the best economy in the world!"" I say, well then, you better have some jobs!
This is what is going on in other countries too. Countries like Canada, Britain and Australia, who you have told me have great economic policies, don’t have good economies. People don´t work enough, so there aren't enough jobs for everyone. If you ask those who work in Canada and Britain how they feel, then they won't say they had the greatest economy ever. But, if you asked people, “How do you like your job?”, many of them will say ‘it gets old.“
The economy doesn't work for most people. However, the fact remains that it does work, in some aspects. Those aspects, though, are very specific, such as trading, business and banking. You have been trained by your parents and teachers and all your life to have faith in those institutions. Why would anyone question the integrity of the"
23,What Do You Base Your Exchange Rates On?,Considering this utterance: What Do You Base Your Exchange Rates On? What is the intent that best describes it?,"You might be thinking something like: I base my exchange rates on the price of the local currency and the current strength/weakness of that currency. You're on a mission to make money.

But you see: If that is so, then all you ever need to keep up-to-date is a good idea of what the currency values are, and they will always move with the prevailing trends in that specific currency, right?
If that's the case, you can't really use any other information than what you have, because that would be a bit limiting. It's a pity, though, to use only one data value, since that can lead you to miss out on opportunities. For instance, a lot of things that are happening right now may not really have to do with what is happening on your currency exchange, but it could have a direct or indirect influence on that. And in those cases, it would make sense to have more than just one source of info at your disposal. 
For example: You see that the euro is rising and you want to jump in now. Great! There could be lots of reasons the value is going up, like the political situation, the economy,...
The other thing is that if you base all your trading decisions solely on one value (and you do that in this example), then you'll be trading in the markets according to that one currency only (which is obviously very limiting). You'll miss any opportunities that aren't in a place or currency you currently have access to (i.e. any opportunity that could happen in, say, USD).
So: The best way to get more info than merely the USD/EUR exchange rate would to actually watch the news (or read news articles). If it says something that makes sense from a business/economic perspective, that may well be something you should be following, even if there's no mention of your desired currency pair."
24,What Foreign Exchange Rate Will You Use?,Considering this utterance: What Foreign Exchange Rate Will You Use? What is the intent that best describes it?,"If you were a foreign investor to the US, you must be familiar with how the FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE is calculated. If not, then let me give you some basics.
The exchange rate is just the ratio of 1 US Dollar to whatever currency you are buying or selling. We just want to know how many US Dollars you need to buy 1 Foreign Currency. This is how you get it:
Ex. 1) You buy a car with 50,000 US $ - you have 50K in your pocket. Now you take that car and sell it in the USA for 50k. That is your US Foreign exchange Rate. The ratio is equal to 50 000 divided by 1. Then you multiply by the current exchange rates. 50 K times 1 equals 50 k. You get 50 US dollars for you car. (this is a US example, but similar principle works for all countries)
When buying and selling foreign currency, there is some sort of risk to this. Some countries have unstable economies, and are more prone to inflation. So a higher exchange is bad, because inflation erodes the buying power. In the long term, the exchange may move upwards. But in most cases it is more likely to move downwards. As the economy of a country grows (and inflation decreases), the currency is valued more against other currencies. When an investor is looking at buying a stock for example; they look at the company’s current assets and liabilities; what it‘s debt to equity ratio, if it has a competitive advantage over the others etc. All things they can look up about the stock and its industry. They do a due diligence and look for a company with a low debt load and a good competitive ratio. One way of evaluating companies are to measure their return on invest (ROI).
ROE= (Net profits/Total Capitalization) * 100 = (Income/Cost) x 100
There are many companies to invest in. Most investors would look to companies with good ROEs. Good or great ROIs are a sign of the health of your industry and the companies within. These are factors the investor will look towards and when investing in stock exchange they have their own indices that they track (Dow Jones, etc). When investing, these investors look into the history of previous companies, or the ones with the strongest potential. Investors have a long time of experience"
25,How Much Will I Get With The Exchange Rate?,Considering this utterance: How Much Will I Get With The Exchange Rate? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it a question of what I could get if I bought the foreign currency today? Or, is it the question, what could I get a year from now? If the speaker had asked the first question and a person had answered ""I will get more when I exchange now than I will when you exchange in a few months or a couple years."" What a response! He must have got a good price at the Forex market. This is how you really feel when getting the right currency. How do you think?

What Are The Benefits Of Exchange Rates? Exchange rates have many important implications on international transactions. For instance, foreign tourists spend money and then take their money back to the country where they purchased their holiday, or they take that currency to some other destination for investments. Foreign companies are in the position of buying raw materials or exporting, when the price of those materials is cheaper. So, there is a need to exchange money for these things or to convert one kind of money into another. The exchange rates play a very critical role between countries, they define the relationships between them; and they are the main factors that drive international trade, investment and financial transactions and the flow of world currency markets.

What is The Intent Of Using “What Is”
This is a very important question when you are considering writing. In this case, when I ask ‘What‘s it called, I think the writer is asking what it‟s name is. So, is this the case? I believe you need a solid grasp on †what you mean to express in the sentence and a strong understanding of grammar and structure. I can also imagine this as, „What was it you named it,„ so, what is name, how does that work?
When we consider ‪what do I want this to accomplish?‪ then we can move on to ‬how to write this correctly.
It is important to know your grammar, sentence by sentence. ‚How do this and this relate.‚ ’Is this right? What would we write the other way?  What would be better? There may be no way to get the answer to this question, but you have to find one. That is where your brain can start moving along. When you know how to structure the words, your writing is much easier. But, it doesn›t stop there. There are other questions that need to be answered as well. Like the first.

28,How Do Your Exchange Rates Work?,Considering this utterance: How Do Your Exchange Rates Work? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is the speaker making the statement to make someone else feel bad or to educate someone? What does it really mean? How can we be so sure about what's right or wrong? If I was talking out of my ass about that I would be called ""arrogant and arrogant"" and ""sarcastic, offensive, and offensive"". What's the difference between those and what the guy says? Why is it that way? Does the way I feel about it make it right?

I am trying to be respectful and not argue in this thread about who is better and more right, because I think that is not the point of this question, but I want others to know how I personally feel.
This is a subjective question about language and how it changes from one language to another. We can't really decide what is right. But what we can do is look at the intention of a statement or a group of statements and decide if it is correct or not. The reason we need to look carefully is that some statements can be interpreted differently by the same person in different ways. For example:
1) English is spoken by people in Australia. So if someone says: ""I've spoken to people from England"" or ""They speak the language in a different way"" it means that they have been to England and have talked to them. However, it can also be used to imply that English-speaking people are from Australia or that the person is from an English speaking country. In that sense it's just a fact, which doesn't change the original sentence much, if any at all. That is what I mean by ""it's a bit of an assumption"".
So how does this apply to the question? I can say with a high degree of confidence that: A) If a person says ""How does the rate work?"", it does not mean what they think it might mean; B) That person's intent was probably not to insult the other person, even though they might come across this way; C) I know that people can have different opinions on what this means and I might be being too literal. This doesnt mean my opinion is invalid. It simply means I am more likely to think something is true rather than false. And if I'm wrong about something it doesn’t make me wrong or arrogant. I simply don't know enough to say how this sentence should be correctly interpreted"

31,How Are You Determining Your Exchange Rates?,Considering this utterance: How Are You Determining Your Exchange Rates? What is the intent that best describes it?,"And, what is it to do?

Well, I am not going to sit here and explain all of it in a very academic way. Rather, here is a short, concise summary:
There are two basic approaches to this, both of which have their pros and cons.
Both have some validity, and both are useful in their own way: The ""one approach"" is to determine exchange rates based on historical values - for example, the Euro vs the US dollar. The other approach is based solely on market prices - that is, using the current market as a gauge for future value. This is known as the ""market approach.""
So, let's look at the following example: I'm planning to exchange €100 on my credit card for USD, based upon the exchange rate as published by the Bank of America website. I find that the rate is currently sitting at $1.50 per EUR, which is pretty close to where I wanted to end up. So, with that in mind, how can I be certain that my €1,500 is going ot equal $2,000? Or $300? The answer, of course, is that it won't: it could very well equal less (in which case, one has lost the trade).
The ""historical approach,"" is by far the easiest way to go. You just take the value of one currency and compare that to another currency that you want to buy or sell. In my example above, that would be the $ rate vs. the € rate, simply because that's what I had to pay with. That way, you're sure that, in terms of the two, they're comparable in value, since the historical value for $ is always greater than for the EUR. Now, if you were to choose a currency other than EUR as your standard, say, Yen, then you'd have to look up historical rates for that currency, too. However, all in all, it's not a difficult process at all. There are numerous websites that allow comparison of this sort of thing for almost anything you can think of -- even the price of a gallon of milk. If your local supermarket or grocery store offers that sorta thing, there you go; it will save you some time. (If it doesn't, just use Google -- it works just as well.)
Now let us take on another example. Imagine"

In the example given, I'd say it's a'statement of fact'.. as you are saying the current exchange rate is $4.50 and you're trying to figure out what the conversion to another currency will be.. it seems to me like a statement of truth based upon a known fact. I don't know why it says 'trying.' I'm trying.. because I can't think of anything else I could be trying. That's my take on it anyway and I hope it makes some sense. The question 'what is it?' may not make sense to you, as it just means, 'What is this thing called an ""exchange rate?""' I'll add a bit more to this one if I think I am going in the right direction."
33,From Where Are You Getting Your Exchange Rates?,Considering this utterance: From Where Are You Getting Your Exchange Rates? What is the intent that best describes it?,"If the first response to you was to think it meant ""Where are you getting the interest rates from"", then you are probably correct. It is an interesting question to consider for another reason: it is very often said ""From where are we getting our exchange rates?"", and many people seem to assume from this that it really means ""The answer to that question is that we're getting them from somewhere."", which I don't believe it means. In fact, I believe that this phrase means something closer to: ""This question: where the exchange rate comes from"" is a good one to start with when thinking about what the question means, as it makes it clear why that is such a strange question at all.
The first problem with this is, of course, ""where is it being gotten from?"", as in:
from where does one get the idea
of  exchange? The answer is clear: that phrase has been in existence for a long long time, and it comes into my head as a question every time I ask it. That is to say, we have had exchange since long before the term ""exchange"" became common. I will go further and say ""We have exchange when two things are not equal (that is: not exchange-able) for some reason"". That can be a useful concept to understand if you're wondering why we call something that isn't exchangeable as 'exchangable'. You can also think about it in terms of what would happen if this were not the case, which is where it gets more interesting. If it were impossible to exchange one thing for something else, then we could say things like ""I don´t have any money now but I hope to get some money, so I'm going to trade you for food"" (which in reality is pretty nonsensical).
In addition, there is something like an informal definition of 'x' as exchange, where x=y if and only if y can only be exchanged for x (it's a very informal and rough definition, to be sure, but it will do for now). In that case one could use 'where' to mean 'the set of x's for which y cannot be exchange'. In other words, it would become clear from the context that what this question'means' is 'for which x', which makes more sense. There is also the concept of exchange value for an object"
34,Can You Tell Me The Foreign Exchange Rate?,Considering this utterance: Can You Tell Me The Foreign Exchange Rate? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it a question about what currency I should pay my friend to receive his payment, or is it asking about the exchange rate at a particular point in time?

If you look at this question through the lens of the two models of intent (I will refer to the model as the IRI model for brevity) you will see that the questions asked in these two examples have different answers.
This question has the same intent as I Can Tell You The Weather. This is a statement about a general rule that describes a specific situation. There's a simple way I can ask this in order to get a meaningful answer: What will the rate of exchange be tomorrow at noon? In this case, that is an I statement.  (You can see an example I of this model in action in this answer to How do I know if I'm being a jerk to someone? If you are familiar with the other models, you may recognize the answer as one of them!)
The question Can I Ask You How Much Is This Coin Worth? is also I. It is simply asking for a price, and this one can be answered using an EIR statement such as, ""this coin has an estimated value of 20 dollars.""
You may see examples of EI statements in questions such The Difference Between I and E, but this should not be conflated with these statements. An E statement (E for 'estimate') is used when we want to give a range of values from which to choose. A question such What range is between 2 and 3? has four possible answers: 2, 3, 2.5,3. But when I say that this coin is worth 20 dollar, I am saying that I have an idea of what its value is, not that it is one value or another, nor that there is some range where it could be placed. That would be an EE statement, which, while it looks similar to an II statement can have slightly different implications and is more appropriate for more specific questions. For example, the question What are the options between $20 and $50? can easily be changed to If $35 were in the cashier's drawer today, how much does the value range between 20 and 50 dollars? The answer is ""the lower bound is 20 or the higher bound of 50"" and we know that 20 is not in their drawer. So, we need to use an ""upper"

If so, what information would you look for in order to figure this out? If not, why not? Do you have some examples of what you think could be the underlying reasons? I am just asking this because there are a lot of things going on around here and I need to get an overall view of how to best think through these issues.

I'm having some trouble with a word problem that my teacher gave us this past Friday. I don't feel like a fool for not being able to solve the problem because I know there will be others. The problem was:
Suppose that a foreign country, which is very stable, makes a new currency. That currency is now equal in value to the US currency ($50.00 = $50.).
a) What will the exchange rate be now? Give your answer to two significant digits. (Hint: There should be no $ in your number)
b) Will it stay the same or will it change? (hint, there should not be a $) Why? Explain. [If it does not change, then what should happen?]
c) Suppose that the foreign currency loses one-fourth of its previous value. Give the new exchange rates and the explanation. Again, no cents in exchange. Why should there be? Can you give some information to support your reasons for your decision? [This is where I'm stuck.]
d) If, as time goes by, the U.S. dollar drops in relative value compared to foreign currencies, explain why some people think there is a risk to holding dollars. Explain what these people mean by a “depreciating dollar.”

For example, you could ask:
‘If I do X, will Y result?“
Here, an answer that says “yes, if you do x, then you will get y,„ would indicate that the speaker‟s intent is not to ask if he or she will be getting what they are after in the future. An assertion like that would say something like ”you WILL get X‹

4) The question implies that your foreign earnings are a part of your company’s profits (which they are)
5) If you did not know this, or didn 't understand, then you can ask me to give me some specific situations where you earn foreign money. For instance, let us say that I earned money from doing business with customers outside of the country. Then, ask me how much of that money is foreign income. Let's say it is 20%. 
6) Let s say you then tell me that you are earning foreign dollars from the sale of goods. So in that case, you could ask how many dollars is one euro. And let‭s‬ say I answer it is 10 euros.”
7) In that situation, it may be more appropriate to answer by saying: “That amount is your income from foreign customers, in this case 20%, or your 10% profit. Your other sales, for example, would be 90% of those sales. You get 90 cents from your dollar. But it does look a bit confusing. If someone then asked me why you would say one is twice‚ as much as the other?‌
8)  ‍ “I would have to think about this for a while and I don't have a good answer. However, I think the best approach is to look at this situation for any business you want to do. There is a certain amount that should be your profit, whether it be from selling goods outside your country or selling in your
  country and taking dollars. That can be up to 50% for some countries. The foreign dollar exchange rates I have heard about are not what most people think"
38,When Does The Rate Get Determined,Considering this utterance: When Does The Rate Get Determined What is the intent that best describes it?,"In my personal opinion, this intent should be defined as “What do we want to do in the future? Is it possible that we will do something in future because of this?”.

But, as we know, in this world, people say things and use words incorrectly. In such cases, there would be ambiguity to interpret the intents that a person wants to say and it will be hard for us to understand. Thus, we need an approach that is able to make an understanding of the context of conversation (intent of speaker/ hearer) by analyzing the language. This is where Speech Recognition comes. It is a technology that interprets a language of human speech and is used for various application. The major area of its application is speech processing. Speech processing is an umbrella term for a set of technologies for analyzing and processing human voices. Here is one of them ‘speech recognition’. As the name suggests, speech recognition can be used to recognize the spoken language and understand the human voice. By using a computer program, it can convert a sound into a corresponding digital string of information that can then be read and interpreted as text or an image. So, here comes the question, how the software works?
A computer has the ability to distinguish the voice of a human from the sounds made by the computer. With the help of technology, the program can analyze the sound and convert it into digital codes. These codes then can understand it as voice or text. We can make it simple by using some basic terms. First is called the phonemes, which is basically the units of language that represents a spoken and understood language, like we would have words. For example : If you say the following sentence : ” I love you ’, The word ‚I‘ consists of 2 phoneme units that are ′i′ and ‛u′. If this is what we say, then we can call it a complete phonemic sequence. Another term is ‪phoneme‬. Phonemics means the study of sound as it is represented and conveyed in human language by a sequence of sounds that together form a meaningful, spoken or signed utterances‪. ›
Now the problem is, these sounds don‟t exist separately in nature; they exist only if they are heard or said together by an individual in a certain place and"
39,What Is The Current Exchange Rate For Me?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Current Exchange Rate For Me? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What is it trying to say? Does it really need to be said? Is it important? Should we even ask? These are all important aspects to consider when answering this question. The answers you choose will depend on the context of the statement/question being posed.
This question may lend itself well to the use of an example. Here is a statement that may help to better illustrate the question:
""What Is the Current exchange Rate for me?""
Let's say that you are at the mall today and you need some new clothes and need help with a purchase. You notice a man at a nearby clothing store and notice his clothes are in your size. He seems to have a lot more money in his wallet than you do. How are you going to ask him how much the clothes cost? You have two options, and in one case you ask the man how the current exchange rate is: (The rate as at this very minute. I am not saying that the rate will be exactly the same for an entire year.)
Here is how you can ask this person: How is
the Current rate of exchange right now? (I know there may be several
different answers depending on what country you're in and the exchange
rates at any given time, but I assume you will only care about the
current one.) Here are your options:  
a.  The current rate, as it stands right this second, is $50 USD for
  1 USD. (This would be appropriate if you were in, for example, the US. If you asked a similar question in the UK, another option would make more sense, such as: ""What
exchange rate would I get?"")
b. This exchange is at par with the currency in my country right
now. It has been at that rate for awhile. For now (at this exact
time), $2 USD equals the equivalent of $1 USD (or any amount of
your currency.) This is called the par value and is what you would
usually see written on a piece of paper in a bank. Par, by
comparison, means ""at the value of"" or ""equal to."" If the price of a
product is not marked as par, it is usually an indication that some
sort of price control is in effect. In any case, a product sold at its
market"
40,I Need My Card Now!,Considering this utterance: I Need My Card Now! What is the intent that best describes it?,"1. To make a purchase. (a)
(b) To buy the best price.
I am inclined to think that ""I want my card now!"" means something closer to option (b), that is, to buy what is on the shelf, but I'm afraid that I would be misreading it. 

A:
The ""verb of purchase"" is not a verb, it's an adjective, used that way because ""purchasing"" a product (or a ""service"", a car, a house, etc.) is what we mean by ""buying"" it, i.e., by using a certain form of payment (e.g, money, credit card, debit card), or (for things you ""own"" but ""sell"" them, like furniture, cars or houses) by the legal form (purchase contract, deed, sale contract).
Thus, we don't need a noun (card) to describe the action, only an appropriate verb (I need). If you want to make clear that the verb is for buying something, rather than for paying a bill, use the present progressive verb form:  ""We are paying by credit-card,"" or ""we are using our card to pay""."
41,My Card Was Not In The Mail Again Can You Advise?,Considering this utterance: My Card Was Not In The Mail Again Can You Advise? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Does it mean the speaker was not able to receive the letter that was sent or the intention is not for the sender to send the card? Is the sentence used to express disappointment or frustration with a sender?

Can you offer suggestions? I am having difficulty in understanding the meaning of the words.
Thanks in advance for your time and efforts
Regards
D.R."
42,I Need My Card Quick,Considering this utterance: I Need My Card Quick What is the intent that best describes it?,"1) Need: The intent is that I need my card (as a means of payment).
2) Quick: A quick means is one that is expedient; one which does not take a long time or is quick to accomplish.
3) I: ""I"" is an object; and I would say that the most likely is 3). That is, I'm not sure that ""2"") is a viable interpretation for this sentence. It has a few problems, but it might be correct. For example, one might interpret it to mean ""The quickest is quickest to be done, which is I"" (or the other way around, depending on which way the sentence is interpreted)."
43,How Long Will It Take To Get To Me?,Considering this utterance: How Long Will It Take To Get To Me? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I can tell it was a joke with humor but I don't know if they are laughing with it as it seems it is a serious question. In the video of the question, no answer is given, only a chuckle is heard. 
I am guessing that the author is not laughing but making a reference to someone else. If the answer given is:

""The answer you are looking for is, 'You can't even begin to understand the complexity of life.'""
  -
A man who has lived and been a part of most of humanity's existence, and
the world in which we live, in, he might say, his own particular
way.
-
The man is obviously not a child; he is an intelligent man. His question has an answer, but, I suspect he meant to question the person that has the knowledge he does and that question is
something he would not have come to by chance, it must have been
planted in his head before the moment in order to be able to utter the
question. I'm not saying the man has any mental disabilities because I do not know what his life was like before he met that
woman; only that he knows that that was the woman who planted the idea in
his head to make the statement."
44,I'M Just Wondering When My Card Will Get Here.,Considering this utterance: I'M Just Wondering When My Card Will Get Here. What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:
[a]
If I'm Just Checking When the Card is Coming, then what is my intent. If I am planning to send a gift, I may be considering when I'll send it, as an expression of my feelings and desires.  I could be thinking that I've been a really good friend so far and the card is coming as a token of appreciation. In all that, there is no question of the 'when' and it would not make sense to use when. It is also not appropriate in many cases of gift-giving.
The phrase in the question is a little ambiguous but can be easily interpreted as the first example."
45,Can You Get Me My Card Fast?,Considering this utterance: Can You Get Me My Card Fast? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The author wanted you to understand that it’s not enough for him to ask, he has to demand that you get him his card. In the context of this sentence, the word ‘fast‘ is being used as a noun, and it functions as its literal meaning. That is, “Fast.”

The word has another meaning, though, which serves as the adverb in this specific sentence. It means, roughly: ” As soon as possible. Very quickly. Immediately.
That means that while you are not required to perform any particular action in the moment, you should be able to get the author his credit card in a short period of time. For example: You can‚Äôt get your card fast, but you can give it to him. You may even have to call his mother, get in your car, drive to the library, find his book on ‚??the shelf‛??
and return it, all of which will take a long time“. Therefore, we can say:
In this case, I am not saying that the noun and the adjective are synonyms. But, by adding an adverbat to my utterence, my sentence has taken on a new meaning and function."
46,How Long Will It Take To Deliver Something To Us?,Considering this utterance: How Long Will It Take To Deliver Something To Us? What is the intent that best describes it?,"For some people, they want to know how long it will take, for others they are concerned with the delivery method or quality of the item, while for many others, it is a combination, a cross-over between the two. The truth is that it depends on who you are looking at but we have a fairly good general idea of what to look for in each answer.

For example, if a customer asked “how long does it take to deliver something”, the most common answer would be ‘1 week if there is time’ or ’1 or 2 business days, we are very good at it, this type of question‘. However, there are a lot of businesses that deliver in a day and are successful (if they have good delivery systems in place) or, are not successful and have bad delivery system in their business, so, you can see there can really be a wide range of answers depending on the type and quality (time, delivery, quality…) of your service. So, before looking for the answer, let‟s see what we can do to improve this question and get a better understanding of when and why it can take so long to get something to you. We will use a few common examples of a business delivering something on time. I should mention that this is my opinion, I am not trying to offend anyone, just sharing my view, not everyone has the same opinion. That said, my personal opinion and experience with business delivery is as a consumer but I have also worked for a number of small businesses and I know many people that run their own business also. Now, without further ado let us see how we could change and improve that question. Firstly, lets look at some possible answers…
1. Business Deliver Time: As a general response, in terms of time it could be answered by: 2-4 months / 2 weeks – if it‚s a big project, 5-6 months – If it takes a long time to develop, 6 months+ – Very complex project
2. Delivery Method: For a fast way to answer it would simply be: In-person / Courier / Post Office / DHL / FEDEX etc. 3. Quality: If the question was asked for something like a house it may be more appropriate to give a quality rating. For example: Very Good, Very Nice, Excellent"

50,Does Delivery To The Us Take Long?,Considering this utterance: Does Delivery To The Us Take Long? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The closest that can be given to ‘intent’ is probably the “concealed meaning” or the ""hidden meaning."" We may ask, ""Does delivery to the Us take long?"" This implies that, in the speaker's opinion, it does take ""long"" for delivery.
What is more, this hidden meaning may be ""deliver to us"" or ""to deliver us."" If we consider a simple question that uses this phrase: ""Who shall deliver this message to her?"" we will have:
1. Who shall delivery this to me?  
2. He shall be the one that deliverys to your place.  ""He shall"" implies a certain certainty. The speaker does not believe that there‘s anybody else available that may „delivery“ this. There may also be a hidden idea that ""the delivery"" could ""go awry"" if somebody else is chosen. In contrast to this, when the phrase ""who shall I deliver these to?"" is asked, there is implied that the only ""I"" exists in one place, as this person is ""there.""
A further hidden intention is that in certain situations people ""bring"" something to their ""destination."" This also implies ""someone"" and ""me.""  We can therefore conclude, that this statement is a ""fatalistic attitude"". This attitude will make us believe ""that there are no better possibilities"", ""it will not change a thing"", etc. We might also add that it will imply ""accepting the fact that something will happen and there's nothing you can do about it."" A person who says or thinks this could be considered ""passive-aggressive."" It is possible that some people can only be passive and aggressive simultaneously. This kind of person will think that you are not able to ""take responsibility"" (active). But if you give ""up,"" then he will also give up. A very important point: This statement will, if the other person accepts it, bring a lot of ""bad luck"" to you. It will be seen as an attempt to control you or your situation and will create a sense of guilt that cannot be avoided by the receiver. (There is always an ""agreement"" in communication)
Another hidden message is: He is not ""able"" - or even ""ready"" as the situation may not be right. If"
51,How Long Will It Take To Arrive?,Considering this utterance: How Long Will It Take To Arrive? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it a statement of fact? An assertion of belief? Something that may happen, or something expected to be the result? A prediction? And how is it to arrive? With a car or the mail? By ship or truck? Or, perhaps, some other method?

We have been looking at the construction of the question itself. Now let’s look at how questions are used for communication.
I don‘t know how long. How long will I be working for you? I don't know. I need some time to talk and think about it. You don' t have time. The bus leaves in three minutes!
A simple example of a question that has many meanings, but is not a query, is this: Where is your dog? The question can mean, Where will you find a particular dog, the speaker“s dog or a dog belonging to an acquaintance, to a neighbor or some such. It can also serve the purpose of requesting information as to the whereabouts of any dog. So, which meaning it has depends on the listener”s interpretation of it – their interpretation will, in turn, depend on their knowledge of dogs, their mood, and perhaps their personal preference. And there are many more questions in this one simple question! I would suggest that a good question is one that allows you to gain information, as opposed to giving it away, especially if the information is private or has little value in your situation! And in addition, questions can be very informative. They can tell you how much the person you‚re dealing with thinks you need to hear that fact, how little or much they care about the subject and the reason why (this could be information you have asked for). And a common question you may have used yourself is when asked by another, How are you! This can have a great variety of meanings and it depends entirely on your mood and whether or not you feel like speaking to them at all! But the fact is, a simple and straightforward question, asked and answered, can convey a lot of meaning! So it must be said that questions and their various meanings are very important in communicating. But questions only give information. To gain knowledge or to understand the meaning of something, you must ask a number of appropriate questions. Let us go on with an example:
Question: What does the sign say?Answer: „The sign"

The example is not quite what I want. In my case, the ""it"" is some sort of a thing I need, so I'm not asking about a ""when"".
In my mind, it is more like this: I know it can be delivered by a certain date, by the time I ask for it. It's probably a pretty bad example, though. I would appreciate any pointers, or if you think my question has no point!

Ok, that was weird. The answer was accepted, yet the comments have no answers. Ok, fine, here are my questions then: can I use a time in the future and can there be some ambiguity to such a date?

And it can be used in many ways, but what's the main intent/emotion/feeling that the speaker is trying to convey? 
Is it possible to express it in a way that will describe the feeling of urgency better than ""delivered by friday""..? Or should I stick with ""friday""?   Thanks!  :)
(PS:  I'm asking in English and need a response in the same language.)  :D
Edit: Sorry I wasn't clear. The way I used the sentence is a common way in our company to indicate the importance of an urgent task, for example, ""I need this project/task delivered yesterday"". This is usually done in formal language, not casual ones :)  Sorry again! :) and I hope it's clear now that I am not looking for a dictionary definition.  Thank you!

Update: It seems like ""on fridays"" is what we use in most occasions, in this language at least. It doesn't seem a lot different from ""by fridsay,"" so I guess they both convey the intended meaning. Thanks again everyone who answered! I appreciate the time spent in helping me understand! : )

57,When Should I Expect My Card?,Considering this utterance: When Should I Expect My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"When should I expect my card? A customer service representative’s perspective.
The following is a perspective of a customer rep. I am sharing it with you because the way a person answers to such a question will determine how fast or slow the company‘s system will respond and whether I decide to stay or leave. This perspective is also useful for understanding and training customer care representatives because we can easily see how different customer answers affect the customer experience at the point of sale. As an example, it is clear that if you answer with “I don‟t know” it can affect customer trust or lead to a negative experience or a bad interaction that can turn into a very negative customer perception. So the key is to answer the ‘when should your card arrive question„ and the answer will influence the speed of the process. For instance, if I answer „I will get in touch with the department for your area“ then it might not be as critical as other answers. But if the same question is answered ‚I am sorry I can‚t do anything, I don't know how many cards I will send to you‹ then you have to be careful because if customers don´t get the cards and they ask questions, that means they have waited a long enough time to get a response for it and it doesn›t seem right that the card will be delayed or that something else will go wrong. In any case, customers will perceive that there is communication breakdown and that is not the desired experience. It‽s better to send the first card within 24 hours. If possible try to do that. There are times it takes time for a card to go out or because of high volume, so if it‛s 24-48 hours it usually goes out. Some companies might be sending cards via an express service which makes everything go through in 24hrs. You will never know which one it will take longer, because each company is different, their volume of orders, etc. Also there are people that receive cards every week, or every two weeks. That‏s not what the average person expects when they wait for their card. Customers expect you to respond to them within a week because you promised that they would get it in a timely manner, and you will have lost credibility with most of them if they don′t.

By my guess, he means: Is the sender known (or maybe not) or unknown when he/she will ship the item? Does it sound like I should know the answer, or does my English teacher tell the same? :/
Also, there are a lot of posts about the ""how long"" construction, ""will"", ""should"", etc. So I do not know if my interpretation is correct. Also, my teacher said we do it in English with some of these expressions, so that is why I'm asking here. Thank you"
60,How Fast Can You Deliver?,Considering this utterance: How Fast Can You Deliver? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I believe it is a rhetorical question, asking “How fast can you deliver?”
There are many things that can be done ‘quickly’ if time is not an issue. But I think that in this case, the person asking the question is saying ” I can deliver what you want ’ quickly ‟‘
“Quickly „ is defined here ( http://dictionary.reference.com/... ) as being ″fast and without delay,″ with a †negative connotation.‵
The question ‚can´you ‌deliver? ‹is not rhetorical because the listener knows what the other person wants, and he or she is offering a suggestion: ′can you ‑delivery? (that is, can´I delivery? The person does not know if this person can do it ‍ or not, but he can offer a recommendation or ‽a suggestion.
This is how I understand it. It ‐would be nice to be corrected. 
Edit:
In fact, I found two different answers, so there are two opinions. And one answers in a comment, that is why I decided to post this ‒

61,"Ordered Awhile Back, What Is The Eta In The Us?","Considering this utterance: Ordered Awhile Back, What Is The Eta In The Us? What is the intent that best describes it?","Is the speaker expressing a belief of the past, or a wish for the future? Or, is there a hidden meaning that is being expressed?

I can't get a grasp of how this could be considered ""rude"". As if there is any such thing as ""polite"" and ""unpolte""... There is a difference in tone between someone who says ""I'm going to order you an ice-cream sundae"", and one who has been ordered an ""ice-sundae"". One is polite (at least if you like ice cream) and the other is rude.
What is it that we are actually expressing with our speech, in the context of ""Ordered X a while ago"" (X = a dessert)?
Is this phrase a ""statement"" or an incomplete sentence (like a question mark)? Or some other category? Why does it need an answer (or the question has no point)? 
Please help me to understand it. :)
P.S: I'm aware that this question may appear subjective, so please excuse me for this. I really hope this is not a subjective post, as I want to ask for some ""general"" explanation of it rather than specific answers. If it appears subjective to you, please, correct me. Thanks a lot.   :)"
62,How Long Should I Expect For The Card To Arrive?,Considering this utterance: How Long Should I Expect For The Card To Arrive? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Consider this one: I’m Waiting A Long Time For My New Card.
Which one do you think best communicates your intentions? If you answered the first one, you‘re right!
It may seem like a pretty simple exercise, yet the way a statement is phrased can mean everything. If the person you want to sell something to has heard you say that you are “Waiting For Something To Happen”, they might be more inclined to buy. On the other hand, the word ‘I“, which is common at the beginning of every phrase, might mean you haven‚€™t even really considered buying yet. And while we‛€•t know for sure what you should be saying, saying the last one is likely to be the best choice, as it is in the form of a question that suggests that your intent is to ask them what they‡€€‰€® think, and not to tell them how or when your purchase plan will change. They„€£€¬€°£¼€©€÷£¢€§€?€¨€º€œ€´€�€·€Ã€â€¢.€ï€ˆ, what is that they think? They want them to understand that, while they may not know specifically what time the card will arrive, it‫€»€¯€²€Â£§, „‹€«€$€, will. In other words, a little less ‚Ä¤ˇ€˜$³˘Œ€­€±€`€†€^££›€(€& €ª¨‪€-€—€/€)€""‮€\€ ‹‧€#€–€
If you were asked to think of what that person would assume based on your words above, how would you describe your thought process for buying the credit card? It is important to note that all of these examples are very general. The best way to phrase your intention is always going to depend on the situation or the people involved. I can only tell you what I think is best and why. As always, your best bet is going directly to the source and having a conversation with whomever you"
63,Whats The Delivery Time To The United States?,Considering this utterance: Whats The Delivery Time To The United States? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I think its about the time needed to get a parcel in the US, because you want to send it ASAP."
64,When Will The Card Arrive?,Considering this utterance: When Will The Card Arrive? What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:
The card may arrive in the next three seconds or in a few days.
B: What does the verb phrase 'When will the card arrive?' suggest to you? (It suggests a specific action that is happening in time, in order, on its own, not a situation where the event happens later than this event or at the same time as this other event, and that the two events are independent of each other. For example, it says when will you eat a snack, but it doesn't say when you will eat it).
C: Which one is right? The most natural interpretation is, the 'when' clause in A is an adverb which means ""a short amount of time""; in C, this is a subordinating conjunction which connects the main clause to the ad-verb, so it could be interpreted as ""in a short time"".

65,Send My Card As Soon As You Are Able To.,Considering this utterance: Send My Card As Soon As You Are Able To. What is the intent that best describes it?,"I would say, ""I'm willing to do what I can to assist you."" In this situation I'm the only card on the line. That's my card.
""I want you to know, I will be happy to help you when you're ready to have me."" This sounds more like a ""guess when I get around to helping you"" type response from which you can't escape. If you do need assistance, you might just have better luck asking a friend or the local post office to hold the mail for a while. This is less likely to be a problem if you have some sort of ongoing personal relationship with the business you need to send the card to. The last card I mailed ended up being held in the post for 3 months before it finally went out. I was in touch with my local PO, and it turned out that they hadn't received my previous mail, so it just sat there for so long. 
It seems to me that the first scenario is more polite. To a degree the second is also. You just give it a try first. In my opinion both are correct ways of delivering information. A person who has a lot of personal interaction with businesses is in a better position to deliver this sort thing on more timely basis. But then again your relationship may not be that long standing, or you may have just never gotten around it. Who knows. Good luck!"
66,When Are Cards Delivered?,Considering this utterance: When Are Cards Delivered? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The answer is: to answer the question. To give some feedback, so that it is understood.

Here: We don't have what, you are asking for. We are trying to give you the answer. The word “yet‽‡
We are not sure, but we are still trying.  
To be more clear: You are looking for something, and we don´t know whether what you want is at our store or not. But we want to be available to help you anyway."

The answer is c. ""How Long"" is asking a direct question.
If you were a student in the US, then you would probably know that there are two ways to complete a research paper and those are as followed...
1) Direct
2) Indirect
Here's the definition of ""Indirect"" research
""An indirect approach is a method of doing research that involves going directly to source material, but then working your way back through your research to arrive at a finding, and then inferring your conclusions by comparing your findings with the facts and data obtained in your direct investigation of source materials""
In other words, you have to look up ""direct method"" first, find the research materials and use them to get a result and you end up using a ""comparison"" to determine your conclusion."

This is not the case here, though."
69,How Long Until My Card Is Delivered?,Considering this utterance: How Long Until My Card Is Delivered? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it describing the future?

I believe the best way to understand this sentence, as well as any other sentence is to try to put yourself in the person's position. So if you did not already read the first question, go back to that question and try. I did a quick search online for this and could not find any information. Does anybody have a link that might help? I know this is a strange question for the site, but my question is very important to me.
Thank you!

(I am using a desktop computer and this may be the reason my searches failed)
*edit
Also, this question was closed after I edited for clarity. Is this because it is about a card that is on its way? (I think this might have happened when the question had the original question.)
If I had made a mistake, what should I do? If anything, I would like to know so I can correct it. Thank you for taking the time to look at my post, and have nice day! :)
**edit-2
In response to user @Randy, he did say that he believed the grammar was good, however, there is more to the issue that I am not sure I have expressed. He also said that some of the people that are using this site could be a bit dense. In response, here are some questions that came to mind:
Should the phrase: how long until my card is delivered be put differently? 
""How Long...Until My...""   or  ""How...Long Until...?
What can a person do about this issue? Can you just write it your way and get past whatever issue it can create? How would I fix this? And lastly, is there a reason someone closed this when they did? What could you do to make the sentence better? My issue is that there are words that just seem to not have their own sentence. For example: My, a/an, the.  There are times when I use them to start a sentence with no other words or just use a word like this as if it was any noun. These are the things that seem like they just don’t have any grammatical rules. And this causes an issue for me because some people may not understand these sentences because if there was a grammatically correct way of saying it, they know. Thanks"

(My native language is Ukrainian)
P.S. I am going to take the GRE, so I do not want to get stuck to something that will make me fail it. If anyone can explain to me in a simple way the most common way of expressing the same meaning, it will help a lot. 
EDIT - After taking the test I realized that I have an error in my vocabulary. This sentence in fact means I was awaiting the delivery of my card, or more generally the arrival/receipt of the message/mail. But for some reason the question was written without any verbs, and for that reason I asked this question. It was an unfortunate typo. Sorry!
To sum up, I need your help. Thanks. :)
p.s. please help with the grammatical error. The grammar is not important, since I will change the phrasing and use it with a correct verb. Just for clarification. My native is Spanish, this may not make a difference, though. ;)
UPDATE
The question I received was the following:
1. What does the native speaker mean by: 'I'm waiting patiently.'
2. And the second question, which was not asked to the group, was: Why is your response a bit 'unspecific?'
My answer, after taking a GRE test in the United States, is: Because the verb in (my) question is missing. You are waiting for a message to be received. In (your) example I don't know what you are awaiting for, for instance, the receipt of your card. That is why I'm not sure it's correct. To me the answer you chose is wrong, too, because the card delivery is implied by the sentence. Hope this clears it up. Thank you again. :-)
Thanks, everyone. Much appreciated. All of you gave me a very useful advice. Especially the explanation about the ""the verb missing"" helped me quite a little. So thanks! Cheers and have a good day. :D

73,I Need My Card As Soon As Possible.,Considering this utterance: I Need My Card As Soon As Possible. What is the intent that best describes it?,"A: To receive money immediately
B: As fast as possible
C: Without delay
D: Immediately
E: Immediately and not sooner

I think D.
Why? Well, I had to think. B is not possible as it has no time component. And C is obviously incorrect as the need is without delay. Therefore, D or E, either. I have been taught, in this situation, to pick choice (c). I understand that the context clues in A and B are very different from C and D so I would probably be more inclined to choose B over A. However, C appears to mean the same thing as A (or even better) as both mean I want it to happen in the most positive way possible. This is why I feel that C or D is correct. 
Is there a reason why B or A would not be a valid answer? If not, why would it be chosen over C?   I know this is subjective, but what are your thoughts? Thank you in advance. Please let me know if any clarification is needed. Any insight is appreciated. Thanks. :)
Edit: A couple of comments have brought up that this question is a good example of the difference between a subjective and an objective question because B would seem to be the opposite meaning of A, that B means ""immediately, without a delay"" in a positive manner. Is that true? Or is A a better choice? I'm just wondering about this. Or, should I just accept C as a correct answer, given the fact that it is clearly what the author most wants, and if I can't explain why A or B isn't correct and explain that, then I should be happy with that? :) Thanks for the comments!
Thanks and happy holidays! :)  Cheers!  ~Sharon
P.S. To the OP: thank you for this great question. If you ever need some help explaining a concept, feel free to PM me. Cheerio! <3
Thank you both for your answers. It is very helpful. Now I see. Thank y'all! ;)
PS: You may be wondering why C.D. didn't get the point that you are both right, it only got me thinking for a while. The reason for me not agreeing is that in my mind, A means 'as soon as' while B"
74,I Need It Delivered By Saturday.,Considering this utterance: I Need It Delivered By Saturday. What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it: “I really, really want this done..”..
“No one knows that I want it done’
Or:
The person saying it, feels the need or has the desire to get it.
It has been done, done well or will be done soon…? [A ‘done‘ that has a ”
sense of urgency‚ as in: it NEEDS to be completed before a deadline and has to
happen NOW. It cannot be put ’off-till‛ later].
OR
They want something. [Maybe they are not happy with what they have received]. They have to have it changed or made better or different. Perhaps something they had not thought or known about. Something they wanted or thought they would not like, they got and they want to change it.. or.. get different [maybe better]. or maybe they just wanted to see how it felt. Or.. maybe..they need something that is not available yet and is going to come. In other words, there is NEED and WANT.. and a sense of URGENCY. All these together make up the NEEDED and Wanted. This is a Needed and wanted by me, I really need this.. I don‰۪ want that… I need that now, before…, or just something, for the sake of.., whatever... So the person who says they need it is in some way expressing their needs, their wants. They are communicating their NEED. And in this case the Needing is urgent! I have not got my needs met yet. But what I do have is, the feeling of NEEDING. The need has an urgency that requires a response. (But, how often is urgency or time a part of the communication, especially today? And what we need, is it urgent? Can I say that about it?) This sense or urgency is part, of, what is needed and what someone says in, „I NEED,„ when they say it to you. ‚..I Need‌.. what do you need? Or I Want‮.. ‰ what is that you want?‬ This can be, and often it will, a way of asking what you are feeling, thinking about, needing now. Is it an emotional Need? Do we Need something?"

""The delivery time of a delivery item is determined by your zip code. This information is used to optimize the ordering process and the delivery. We cannot guarantee a specific delivery date, even if the item was ordered before 12:00 PM CST on a Monday. In general, the order will be shipped within 1 working day but is not guaranteed. Items may be delivered Monday through Saturday and must be in your possession. Please be advised that in most cases, UPS will leave a phone notification if an item does not get there in a stipulated amount of time. It is up to the recipient to verify that they receive the package and that the contents are undamaged.""
*""Please note: Delivery dates are set based on your location's time zone. Our system uses UTC.""*
How does this compare to: The delivery method is UPS Ground. How do you want the products delivered? UPS Next Day Air. Which one best fits your intent?
Also, what if I want it to say: *""Delivery times are subject to change without notice""* I would like an explanation on how this is possible.
I have also had a situation where the product delivered was the wrong one. I received two different product that were supposed to be one item. The order total was not changed, so how did they know to give the right item without knowing my phone number? It was a small error, but there was no way for my recipient know what I wanted when the person rang the doorbell without being sure. My order is set up with a tracking number which was used, in this case, to help them.

credentials and you're in. (I was thinking about using it when I get my monthly statement, but you could probably also use it at the store.)
The answer is: (0,0).
Intent (what was the speaker's goal when they said the utterances?): (1,3). They intended to get their monthly bank statements from the mail at home. They wanted that information because they were expecting it. This makes the answer: B."
77,Can I Choose A Date For Delivery?,Considering this utterance: Can I Choose A Date For Delivery? What is the intent that best describes it?,"A) I have no control over the scheduling of the delivery.B) The dates that I choose are for the purpose of delivering the order.C) You are free to select the dates for delivery within reason, provided the items are in good condition.D) There is no delivery date that we are responsible for.E) We will make every effort to meet the requested delivery dates.F) Delivery dates are not set in stone.G) Your dates will be honored.H) No, there is only one delivery time, which you can choose.
The correct answer, E, is a common error made by the English Language Learner when learning the vocabulary that is used to describe the language. E is incorrect because no dates and dates in general are included as part of an “offer”. ‘No date chosen’ and ’You will honor dates‘ are correct, as are ” You can pick a delivery day, subject to the condition that my items will fit into your vehicle.“, „I agree to all dates chosen by you, and I will take responsibility for any damage caused by your choice‚„ and even ‚You are under no obligation to honor the agreed dates, but I hope you will!‛ These are all appropriate ways to use the noun ‗date‹ in the common sense sense.

What else could make things clearer? Or am I missing any better synonymous words? This is a question for a technical writer. Please feel free to edit my question. Thanks!

A:
*I will be happy to receive my order on a particular day. [=I want to know when the order is ready to pick up.]
You have the idea right. *I would be pleased to have my orders on time is also OK."
79,Can I Have It Be Delivered At A Certain Time?,Considering this utterance: Can I Have It Be Delivered At A Certain Time? What is the intent that best describes it?,"For me, ""Can I have what be delivered at a certain time."" seems to be a better representation than simply ""can I deliver"".

As a native English speaker, this is probably not that much of an issue, but I wonder if it is possible to have such ambiguity even in an English translation?

OP's original: What does ""What is it that"" mean here? It is not the subject of the sentence. So, I guess ""what"" is used to mean ""which"". But, is that what it actually means or is there some other meaning? Can you please explain? Thank you.

Hi Dale,
I think the ""something"" in the question means ""a thing (of value)"" or ""the thing in question"", or something of that sort. The question is really about whether the person can be trusted or not, and ""I can"" (as in 'I will') is a very good answer here. ""The thing is"" or 'the matter is' would also work (I don't think there's any difference in meaning). ""Could be"" would work as well, too, if this sentence is being used in a way that implies that ""thing"" can't possibly be ""delivered"" at the specified time. If so, it could be translated as follows: ""Will this be possible?"" - or perhaps, as suggested, with any uncertainty or doubt included: 'Couldn't it be that..?""
Cheers, Karen
You need to remember that English is highly dependent on context for its interpretation and many of its nuances. In this case, the context is pretty clear. It’s an expression used by a person who feels that they have the ability to do what they are asking about. I think that is where the ambiguity lies. But then, maybe that‘s why the answer is good, isn“t it. :)
(As the above is only an interpretation of what may be meant, perhaps you could elaborate on what you mean by ""This utterances: [...]"" and how you can distinguish it from the OP's initial sentence.)

In either of those cases the correct phrasing would be ""The card does not work anymore""

87,Can You Please Identify The Problem With My Bank Card?,Considering this utterance: Can You Please Identify The Problem With My Bank Card?

This utternce could be rephrased as: I need help with a bank problem.

This kind of utterances or text is commonly referred to as being informational, as this is an informative utter, which can be found in many conversational data. Informational texts are common in everyday conversation between friends and colleagues, but also during conversations on social media, like Facebook. We will talk a little about social-media data and how such data can help us to improve our understanding of the way people interact in society. However, we first need to look at how we can find the Informative utter:
As mentioned above, to do so, let us first look into the meaning of Inform and Informate. Wikipedia states: Inform is a transitive verb meaning ” to give information to …„ or in a more colloquial way, „ to tell‟. Information is also transmissive, meaning: To inform somebody, something or someone is to pass on some kind or information. The verb inflects, and the past tense form of inform is informé. In the present tense you can informer, informè. All forms can also be combined, for example, a person can simultaneously inform and inform about something. ‏
The ‚to‘ of ‬inform is optional in English, however we tend to leave it out when inform-ing someone about a topic, therefore the sentence could have the same meaning without it. It seems, the verb to inform also carries along the information, that a request is involved. To ‖in‗form a group of people, or to ‡‖form‬ the intention, you will most often use the word †ask‡. Here is how you could ask someone to form the ‪information‫ of who has the credit card that you need. You could also use, ask for ․the information on․ a company, product, topic. When asking for information of a product it sounds like, can you please tell me the cost of your new laptop?

88,How Do I Unblock My Card Using The App?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Unblock My Card Using The App? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The utterances are extracted from our corpus of real world conversations using two different models: A generative model and a discriminative approach. Both models were used to extract utterences and their associated entities, as well as their intent.
It is assumed that the utterment “How do I unblock my card using the app?” is extracted by a human speaker, who has already described the goal of his interaction with her own words. This is a simple model that assumes that if the words (“app’s user‘s words„) are the same as „How‟, and all of them are present in the corpus, we can safely assume a high confidence that it is describing the exact same goal. The model is built upon the ‘How does it work?` uttermeant extracted with the generatve approach and is trained to recognise the different intents of the sentences extracted."
89,My Card Does Not Work,Considering this utterance: My Card Does Not Work What is the intent that best describes it?,"To be honest, I didn't think it was possible to answer this question, and even with some research I was still stuck.
So I started to type this post, hoping to be able to find some answer by the time I finished typing.  
And after typing about 30 words into this, suddenly came to the conclusion ""Oh, this is easy!""
The intent was to convey that someone (possibly me, but more likely someone else) had been working with a card reader for a few months, has the card, knows what it is, what brand (or other details) it has, etc. and it just doesn't work. I'm aware that I could just say ""It doesn’t work,"" which is what I would normally do. However I'd appreciate it if there is also some context around my use of ""My Card Doesn't Work.""
In addition, the answer would be different for each individual reader of the sentence. That is they may think that ""I"" am talking about myself with the use ""my"" or that it could also be somebody they know with ""card"", etc., which in turn would lead to different responses. If that was the case for the OP, he would have said ""Card doesn's work."" I don't have a specific situation I am currently working on so I used my example to try to figure out which answer is most appropriate here. But as I said, it doesn' matter what is written here: there will be someone reading this who thinks the way I did about it, so my answer may not be what you think is correct. It can only be useful to those who already think the same way that is asked about.

 So to make this a bit more clear I will add this picture:
A, B, C are different ways of interpreting/answering the question. There is no right answer because we all will give different answers, depending on our personal views about things. My point is that the best possible answer for this situation (according to you) is A. For example, if you answered A and later you decided that D is better, you would still be doing exactly the right thing, as you wouldn't be changing the meaning. In the end, all of us will agree with our answers and I hope all answers here will make sense at the moment they are being written. And we will not change our answer later"

It is true that if I buy a card for you, it will stop working? If so, how do I get it to work again? This means it's not a simple truth or opinion. Or maybe it is: ""I will pay it forward.""
I don't know.
So what is it, I'd love to know the answer to this question, because I want to share this with everyone and see if they also can't tell what the correct answer is. (And no. I don.t have a t-shirt that says 'the correct' answer on it. So don' t get in touch with me).
You're probably wondering why I'm asking this. Well, a lot of my friends and family have said to just send their cards back to them. But that is not so great. And I also need the cards to be functional again. They are not working. It's a problem I need to solve. Which means I have to figure out a different way to use the card or make it work. 
(In fact, some time later I had a similar problem. My card stopped working, and then I found out why. There was a small flaw in the magnetic stripe on the back of the credit card, not the plastic, so even though I got a new plastic card back, my number and everything else on my back was still visible, which was kind of a pain.)
And I do want the original card to still work too, even if just to make sure I know how to repair it and so we can use it again sometime. Just in case there is a future problem for whatever reason. That's why this matters. Otherwise, you'd just get a bunch of cards that are unusable (and then you have that big box of them, right next to your old one).  So yeah, that's what this is about. :)
Thanks for reading. Feel free to tell me I should be ashamed of this whole thing and that I've lost my damn mind or something. This is just what we do around here. ;)
Also, feel free for any additional clarification. Like I said, this may be a difficult question for some to understand. Thanks, as always, for the help. If you could give me some idea what direction to go with this, or even what to change or add, thanks a million."
94,I Think My Card Is Broken,Considering this utterance: I Think My Card Is Broken What is the intent that best describes it?,"I believe he is stating a fact and he will state a hypothesis. He will present evidence to the fact he states and evidence for his hypothesis that he presents. This is a common approach taken by people to explain things.
A hypothesis, by definition, is an educated guess. It is based on a statement or evidence of the truth of a premise (the fact).
If you think that your card is broken, that is not a claim that you believe, you are stating that the evidence presented to you (your card) by another person is evidence that they are wrong. If the other person was wrong then you were right. You are claiming that this evidence supports the premise in order to convince them. 
In the sentence, he did not explicitly state that his claim is in the form (I think my card IS broken). His claim could be in this form:
This card was working when I last used it, this is now a different card and the way that it is acting is unusual and unusual to me, therefore the previous card must be broken."

""I have been using my old credit card""
or 
""...I used my credit to my new credit (card)..."".

Please help me. Please!
Thanks.   (:D)
*NOTE: I am aware of this thread. However, the question is different because we are trying to find the ""best"" translation of a phrase. In this case, if there is a better interpretation, we want to know why we choose them and/or how to use each one (as opposed to trying the phrase in various contexts)..  :)
UPDATE:  I want it to have 2 meanings, one literal and one metaphorical. This literal, ""the card has expired"", is more commonly used in the U.S., and so I would like to be able to say: ""My card expired"" = ""The money has run out"", but I don't have the card for the credit anymore or ""This credit is no longer valid"" in some sort of metaphoric way (i.e., it is just a card of credit, a credit that doesn't exist because it's no more valid/active).
So in other words, this is for an online game, and it would have a button saying, something like, ""...the account has lost the ability to make charges.""
(And to think it all came from a joke of ""Do you still have your old cards?"") Thanks again! I truly appreciate it if I get a response (in this forum or elsewhere)!
Thank you all! :)  *Hugs*

98,My Card Doesn'T Work.,Considering this utterance: My Card Doesn'T Work. What is the intent that best describes it?,"I'm not talking about this being a typo. I am talking more about why someone may write this. Here is a sample of the sentence from a customer service call.

""I'm sorry for the inconvenience. The credit card that was given to you yesterday doesn't work. It looks like the wrong card was placed on us.""
If my goal in this question is to discover intent, why should it matter? If the person in the call center was trying to be nice, I guess they didn't think of asking the customer about the reason why the card doesn't work, or maybe they just didn' t care or didn'.t want to care. Why would you need such information? What do you think would matter if the statement was ""The card you have on file doesn`t works?"" Does it change how you would perceive the message?
I've read ""how do I"" questions and they were helpful. This question was more in-depth than that. My intention in asking this was to find someone who would be able to answer ""why."" 
My second thought is that, if one person has a reason for what the other does, that is more important than ""How do"" I. Would you consider my question off-topic? Can I use google and find the answer?   I think the intention is just a little deeper than I thought!

Example: I really hate when you can't call me until 11 o'clock, but I don't want to leave messages. How can i get out of the problem

100,My Actual Card Isn'T Working.,Considering this utterance: My Actual Card Isn'T Working. What is the intent that best describes it?,"If your intent isn't obvious, you need to be more explicit. The best way is to put your focus on the other person's understanding (in this case, the one whose ""card"" isn' working).
For example: ""Hey, I'm having trouble with my actual card. I just used my other card, so I don't know how that's going to work out.""
Note, a card is used here as a metaphor for a debit/credit card (that is, something you use in order to purchase something). Your use of the actual word card has an extra, implicit meaning and so does not make sense.
In this way, ""My actual bank card isn´t working"" is an example of what you might call a ""metaphorically true"" sentence, where the literal meaning is somewhat misleading. (This also has implications for your sentence structure: The word ""actual"" implies something that is not actually true. You might reword this to something along the lines of:
""The bank (or my current financial situation) won´ t let me use this debit card right now, but I´ve got another one."""
101,Is My Card Broken?,Considering this utterance: Is My Card Broken? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it trying to imply that it could possibly be broken by the end of the year? Or is it just asking out loud for someone with a little more knowledge than he has to inform him if it is broken, or just a friendly expression for the people of his card making community.

It depends on several factors. Some people say that their card is ""broken"" to simply express that its performance isn't what they expected. If I'm not mistaken they usually are referring to the fact that the image on the card did not turn out in the intended way. But even then it doesn't always mean that a card will not function at all. It's up to your imagination. In the case of my broken car, I was talking about a car with no engine that runs on a motor in a garage, a real car. (A car that isn´t really broken but just needs a new fuel, in this case)
The card might be made with very poor quality ink or paper or even with ink that is not compatible with the paper. This can affect the appearance of a print. And a poor print is definitely something a ""card maker"" should take care of, by printing a replacement card."

I broke a card and the person who has the broken card is going to give you your money back.

103,My Card Stopped Working,Considering this utterance: My Card Stopped Working What is the intent that best describes it?,"(I am not interested in answers that rely on an English language dictionary)
To be more specific, the following utterances are in the same context:

I ate the machine with my bare hands.
My computer froze and now I can't use it, my computer is dead. My computer was frozen. Is it dead? Does it need to be rebooted? Is there a way to save the work I did on the computer before it froze so i could save my work off a disc? Can I save it to a flash drive? What? (I can tell you it was working fine until I had to go to sleep, and then it just suddenly stopped working without telling me why)  
...and the list goes on.  Please help me identify what best fits for each. Thank you. ^_^!!!
Edit: Some people have suggested that the sentence with the card is in present tense, while the other two sentences with computer and computer are past tense. I am unsure where this comes from or if they are truly different tense forms of the sentences above. If you disagree, please state why. Thanks. ;)
Update: I've found that this is a question that has been asked several times before. See this question, this one, or this. Unfortunately the answers there do not satisfy my needs as I have not found a single good answer. However, that doesn't mean there isn't a good one out there somewhere. Anyways, I hope my question has now been sufficiently answered :) Thank y'all for your help. :)
Oh, one last thing, a couple of people suggested the words ""was working"" could be used as it's own verb on its own and not in conjunction with cards (ie, ""I was just using the Internet."")  I don't agree with this as the context of all of my utterences is ""card."" I guess I should add: ""My card was still working until..."" to the utterings above, but I'm thinking it doesn' have to and would probably be a distraction from the original question and its intended context. So I will just ignore this suggestion. Okay, now my head's just spinning with all the ideas and information I just got here. It's great!

104,"My Card Is Broke, What Do I Do?","Considering this utterance: My Card Is Broke, What Do I Do? What is the intent that best describes it?","A. To make you ask questions
B. to tell you how to do it yourself? (and if you follow my directions, your card would not ""be"" broke)
C. a simple warning
D. an insult
E. I could not care less about your ""card being broke"", and I certainly do not want to waste my time and my attention with your trivial complaint.
I would think E. was the best answer, because the uttering of ""I cannot care about it anymore"" is a statement of complete indifference, not a request or complaint (which might be why I chose E.)
The ""intent"" or the ""mood"" that I am trying to convey is this: I cannot be bothered. (I am not really angry. But you may assume that a ""broken card"" means I lost some money and now must spend more to make it right.) And I do want a warning or suggestion. You see, I don't want you to lose what I have spent on the card, but I still need to have an explanation of how I can get a replacement. The utterances in (A) and (B) are just silly (as in ""why would I bother with that?"") I would never say that in reality. E, in its original meaning, means ""don't care"", not, ""you are wasting my/ your time"".
My question is, when one utter the phrase, what is its meaning? I guess it comes from the context of the situation, which is important, as you see. Please correct me if I'm wrong. Thank you. 
EDIT: It seems that (C), in the sense of an instruction, should also have been given at least a mention. This was not the case, hence my question. However, (E) (in the original, and not in my example), has a meaning of indifference. In reality, if the speaker does not give any further clue, it is hard to figure what the real intent of (the speech) was. It is also a good example of irony. So my ""further question"" (sorry) is: why did that expression not appear in your answers? It would have helped. Thanks!

As a writer, we often use colloquialisms to give the scene or character a more intimate and conversational feel.  As a good rule of thumb, it should feel like you are speaking to someone who is sitting next to you.
Here are other examples of conversatiosn with similar intents:

Edit to help address comments
In the examples above, the first one is a general statement. There is no real context as to who the speaker is and who might need the help. This isn't a conversation between a husband and wife, who are usually in the context of the home, or a co-worker. The second example is very similar, but more of a personal statement as a way of making the other feel better about their situation. Third example, while it does say ""no problem,"" again, there is little context (at least for me). I would say this is more in a friend, colleague, etc. context. Fourth, in this conversation, someone is asking for a favor, and is not asking another for help in order to have that person's back, that is, ""be here"" in case of need. In the fifth example (last), someone does have their back (I'm there, I'll help) but isn's asking a second person to lend them their time and efforts. Someone might say, as in #6, 'What's the big deal?', or 'Are you sure your not just being a wimp?'. Finally, an example of ""I've Got You in Mind"" (as used above) can actually have a sexual connotation, though that may not be the original intent of someone using such a phrase. To my knowledge"

112,My Card Suddenly Quit Working.,Considering this utterance: My Card Suddenly Quit Working. What is the intent that best describes it?,"a. I am upset.
b. Something has happened. (I want to know what)
c. My card has had a problem with payments lately. That is a real problem. What should I do? What would you do in this situation? (What should be done by both me and the bank). What's my course of action? How do I handle this? Do I need to? Where do we stand? Are we going to work this out? This is really not a good problem to me. It is not fun. This sucks. You might call it a “problem.”
My bank has a new problem, which they are still working out, that their system is now experiencing some serious down time for the last 2 days. They are not sure what caused it or how to fix it at this time so that all of our transactions are being processed correctly. We have been experiencing a series of problems in the past few weeks so it’s not anything new. But this problem is causing our payments to not be processed in a normal fashion. The bank can not figure out how our card system suddenly quit working so the money is getting stuck and sometimes is never processed at all. Some people are getting their transactions declined and they get the notice of ‘payment pending‘ and nothing ever shows up. Our credit card statement will still show the full amount spent but it does not post to the account. A few days ago, we had to make a $100.00 deposit into our checking account just because our credit cards wouldn‚t work. When you go into the card processing area, you will see that there is no payment pending on the credit line so you can still use these cards just fine. Unfortunately for us, our system crashed when the person that manages cards for our bank got sick and his supervisor is out of town so no one knows why we are having this problems. If the cards work, then we can pay online or if we need a bill we have to mail them to us to our PO Box. There is nothing else we know of. Since this is our first issue with them so we‡re not aware of any other problems so far so they must be working. Just to mention, I‰ve never had any problems with credit or debit transactions. In fact, all other transactions work fine with our banks. Why is it suddenly crashing?"

This is incorrect; it should be ""I cannot use that card anymore..."" The best answer would be to say "" I cannot do that anymore"" or ""The card has been rejected"" but that is just the beginning. ""That card does not work"" is not really the issue; the real issue is that that person cannot get to that part of his or her wallet. If that happens and that particular card cannot be recovered, then you will be charged for that loss. (I've been in some stores where they will not give back cards because they have lost the authorization for the credit card. They will, however, refund a portion of that transaction, though I don't know the amount of what is refunded.)
Another example: ""This pen does no good anymore."" Or:
""I'm not supposed to be doing this.""
And there you have it. It is always useful to check out how a sentence fits in an idiomatic phrasebook if that will help you with a particular usage. Good luck!

An old trick I used to teach my children, when they were little and misbehaved. Tell them that they are in trouble so that I can give them another chance to behave better. When that doesn' work for whatever reason, I would say that you are not going to get this again because it is going directly into the box with their toys and games. Then I will take the toys out and put a big box of toys in the middle of the closet with no toys inside. And I'll ask them what do they want to do in that situation? Then, you can see they understand why they can't do anything anymore. The other way is to just tell them ""this is why I am not letting you do xyz"".

117,Nothing Goes Through On My Card.,Considering this utterance: Nothing Goes Through On My Card. What is the intent that best describes it?,"The first word: ""Nothing.""

It's the best word to explain the thought of ""nothing."" But the fact remains, that the word isn't enough to do it by itself! Why? Is it because it is a word? No! Is the ""no"" a noun, a verb, or a preposition? I don't think so either!

In fact, this sentence has many other aspects to it. ""That which goes, does so through the card."" That sentence also has aspects that are worth exploring here and there. But they aren't the essence.
So, what about ""through the credit card"", does it have some sense?
Let's say the answer is ""No""! Let's imagine that we are talking to a guy, who has a lot of money but is always going short! So we tell him, ""Let us help you. You know what? We are going to buy something on the Internet, and we will use your credit cards! Let us use the computer and see who buys it and where, so we can get some information for the purpose of stealing more money out of his account."" Now, he will be so scared that he doesn't even dare to say ""Yes!"" and he is even more surprised when he hears ""So you want to get my credit information!?"" He will look at us with fear in his eyes. We will say, while laughing a little, as we know that this is our goal from the very beginning, we laugh and say to him ""Don't get worried, it's for our own benefit. In reality, the only intention of this card is to go for everything! We just need to see where it does and the money goes! Isn't it so?""
He will continue to be confused. He doesn’t understand how can that be done. Why is that card just for you and nobody else can use it! I am so confused! That's okay. So, you can be happy that you have a credit line and you pay your bills regularly. Don't worry, nothing will happen. Let it go! You don‘t need this information. Your credit score is perfect, there are no problems! It seems that it will not be possible. And we"

This utterances has the following meanings:
1. I have not been able to find my card and I am wondering whether or not someone may have taken it or used it. (I suspect the person who took it.)
2. The reason I ask this question is that the card may be lost. If it was lost, then the speaker is wondering if this person may know where it is. It seems to me from the use of the negative in the phrase ""I can't find..."" that speaker does not think the stolen card has been found or the owner has not come forward to claim the lost card. So, the second sentence is meant as one that would be asked if a stranger had the ability to locate the missing item or if the loss owner had taken the cards home or to the bank. This may or may not be a genuine question; it depends on which context the sentence comes from."

If the statement is true and factual, you will find yourself in a better place after you have spoken about it to others and found that it is not as bad as it seems to the casual listener. If the person has a valid concern, it should be a legitimate concern. But if it turns out that the individual has fabricated the story, then you are in the position that I was in, trying to help someone who is lying. In other words, the situation is a fraud. The other person is trying for a financial gain or a social benefit at your expense. It’s an intentional effort to take advantage of you. At that point you just need to move on. Don‘t engage further with the liar or person that would lie. You can‚€hear a lie in five seconds” and you can also smell a con. And if you smell it, chances are good that many others at the table do, too. So, how do you know you‍€re being lied to?

Intention to do a dishonest thing- The speaker intends to use the credit card of another person without their knowledge, or to obtain credit or benefit from their name or reputation without justly
entitling himself.
B. Intent to get the best or a better deal- In this situation, the speaker wants to be able to purchase goods or services without getting the same deal as others are getting. For instance, he or the
hearer may be willing to pay a certain amount of credit to avoid having to wait in a long line or having a poor selection of items. Or he may want to save money by getting a special gift. So he would be getting
a better/different deal than the person waiting in line/having a limited selection. His intent is to benefit by the different deal without having the disadvantages or inconvenience of the other person.C. An intent to cause harm- To hurt someone or damage their reputation. This happens when the speakers words have the wrong
intent. The person may have malicious intentions against someone else or have other negative motives.D. It can also be used as an expression of disbelief that the information being shared is true. In that
case, I don't believe you or I'm not sure.E. Some other usage- A phrase that has been used a million times in the English language can be re-contextualized or be changed depending on what the situation
is. I believe that would change the meaning of that phrase.For example: If you want something in return, then you don'T Believe I'll Do it! If I'M Going to Do It - Then I Don't Believe You'D Do that Either. What about if the word

A:
There are probably a variety of emotions and thoughts being used by the speaker and listener(s), and it may take multiple words to communicate any one of them. Some emotions, though, are very clear and easy to understand, for example anger, fear, happiness, sadness. Other emotions are harder to pin down, although it's always possible to find a specific description that might be used for that emotion in other contexts. For instance, consider the phrase, ""I have feelings, but you don't care."" It could refer to anger (You don' care about my anger or you're indifferent to it), disgust, hatred, envy, sorrow, worry, and a whole host of other things. A single phrase could be referring to any of these, so you'll never know. But you could always guess at what the other person is feeling based on what emotions you know are common in situations like this and what you've seen happen before."
130,"Card Is Lost, Please Help","Considering this utterance: Card Is Lost, Please Help What is the intent that best describes it?","Is the following sentence true?: If I said ""I wish the people would come to an understanding,"" then that is my intent.
(I'm not talking about the original speaker. I am talking specifically about a hypothetical person who might have said that utterances of that type.)
In other words, is it true that if I uttered something like this, that then is what I would have wanted in the first place? (That is, if my original intent was to ""bring the matter to a conclusion,"" so as to achieve some purpose, then am I not saying, and indeed implying, exactly what happened?)
EDIT:
Let's consider another hypothetical case: if we imagine that the two parties were discussing the fact that a certain person, John Smith, had gone missing, when he suddenly appeared (without any explanation).
Then, this person would say: John, you have been lost for three days and you do not answer your phone, so how did you get there? And, the person might reply, ""Because of an argument that I had with my girlfriend.""
Now, I ask: is that person's reply true in terms of this hypothetical dialogue? 
And the reply would be: yes, since that intent clearly emerges from the dialogue itself, because in order to get back to his girlfriend, it must have taken three full days for John to travel there. But now, how can we tell, given that there was no original uttering of the type above, whether that reply is a true example of ""the speaker intent"" in this situation, as defined above? Or rather, does this reply just emerge as a ""true"" reply out of its own accord in a kind of dialogue-automation process? In other word, are we just guessing that this is really what the speaker wanted to convey by saying this? If so, can't we do the same thing in some other cases (such as when someone says ""please tell him this"") where we guess at the actual original ""intent"" of what was said? Am I asking for a clarification of whether there is an alternative approach to this question. If this approach fails to make sense, please feel free to reject it without explanation as an exercise to the reader, or to ask for clarification.

Police reports contain information about criminal investigations and can provide the information that will be needed to prosecute a crime, determine a person's status and identify and locate missing persons. Reports provide police information which may include: name, address, date and time of an arrest, the crime or offense and information concerning the accused or the victim. Most police departments record every arrest made by their officers. The information recorded may vary from department to department. It depends on the size of their police force and their policies. Generally, it is required by state law that arrests be recorded in all cases involving misdemeanors, but not felonies. For example, if a woman is charged with a misdemeanor of prostitution the arresting officer may record the charge and make no arrest entry for prostitution. But, an arresting police officer who is arresting a suspect with multiple charges may make additional arrests at the same stop. This would result in arrest entries that include a date, time, a location (the exact street address and number if available) and details about each offense. Some departments may even list the arrestee's name and date of birth in their reports. A police department also may note the offense charged and if the suspect is under the age of 18 or an adult if there was also a juvenile arrested in a criminal case along with their name. Many police records contain fingerprint, mug shot and police record report of a case in addition to a standard arrest record. Fingerprints are submitted to criminal"
134,I Lost My Wallet Today With All My Credit Cards. Will You Please Block The Card And Send A Replacement?,Considering this utterance: I Lost My Wallet Today With All My Credit Cards. Will You Please Block The Card And Send A Replacement? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Intent is a word that is often confused with the more precise concept of action, and sometimes even with mood. The distinction between an emotion, state of mind, or intent of a person with reference to an action is essential.
In a strict context, intent is what a conscious person or a group of individuals are willing to do. It is their motivation for the action or the decision to carry it out. A person’s intent may either be to bring about an outcome or to abstain from an unwanted effect. Intent can be manifested by the person as a state, by his/her body language, facial expression and voice, as well as by body movement. In the latter, there is also a psychological aspect: the desire to move. Therefore, the body can serve as an agent for a change in the mental state. For example, when we move we change the way we think, which affects our emotions. If this change of affect is strong it can cause an affective state called emotion. So we can say that intent (body movement), emotion (affective response), and state or emotion are three aspects, that can change each other in an interaction. However, it is not always clear in these kinds of interactions what each aspect is and what happens to them. That is, we may observe only one aspect at a time. Sometimes it becomes clear that the emotional response is caused by a cognitive process like perception, thinking or remembering. This process can also be reflected as the emotion that leads to the state and so on and on. As such, a better and more detailed description is offered in this answer that will attempt to define more clearly the three interdependent aspects of intent, emotion and their respective states and emotions with an explanation of how they change and interact in a given interaction between people. There are also other answers that give an analysis of what intent means with respect to human interaction and the social sciences, especially with regard to psychology and sociology. I chose this particular answer because it gives a more accurate and precise definition of the concept intent in its various forms and relationships to emotion in human interactions than other alternatives that are more descriptive. Thus, in addition to more precisely defining intent for our purposes, this is an answer is more directly applicable and thus more useful at providing more detail with examples. Please consider also the other three answers given"

You are asking him/her a series of questions that help you understand how the child is feeling today. These questions help the person you talk with to feel understood in their own situation. Asking questions helps you learn about your listener and their feelings and thoughts. It is a two-way activity that benefits you both. When talking to a friend, ask your questions out loud and let the other person answer. Ask questions when you can. If someone you love is in pain, your first instinct is to comfort them. By asking questions, such as those presented here, the listener can share their emotions, fears, or thoughts with you, in an honest way and help them cope with their situation more quickly. The more you communicate, listen, understand, help, empathize and accept your family members, friends, neighbors and even strangers, by asking them questions such and the ones below, they are more likely to open up and tell you what they're going through, even if you don't know what it is. They can trust you with what is really important to them in life, because you care. This is good for both of you and for society at large. You won,t be surprised how well this works. Just use questions to understand them and then help. Use the list of question categories to organize any questions you need to ask. There are no wrong questions. In fact, asking good questions is one way to learn and remember things. And by the way, it's not as hard as it sounds. All you really need is some interest in people, a little practice (practice makes perfect!) and a willingness to listen. Here are a few suggestions to get started: 1). What Are You Thinking? This may be the first question that comes to mind, but it can have an impact on your relationship. After all, what comes out of your thinking affects your behavior and your attitude about others. Therefore, we should learn to ""observe and notice,"" as"

The person who lost the cards was very careless with it because it is a business card. I can see the business address but no name or phone number. 10) Somebody lost their phone and I have this businesscard, so here you go.
13. It is very likely that someone lost an identification card in their house. 14. When he arrived at his destination, he looked around for the keys but they were nowhere to be seen. 15) How can you get rid of a person‟s attention from a place without him knowing about it (for example, on a TV station) 16) He has lost his car (he went out to the grocery shopping). 17) His phone was stolen while he was on the bus (It is possible, the thief might not be an adult.

140,I Think My Card Was Stolen.,Considering this utterance: I Think My Card Was Stolen. What is the intent that best describes it?,"I believe that the meaning of this phrase is ‘I think my card was stolen and I want it found and returned to me.’
The first thing that springs in my mind after reading that is: What? This person doesn‘t even know for sure that their credit/debit or charge card has been stolen. This can certainly be a very real possibility; however, the person that says this should know that it‚??s not always the case that your card is stolen or that there has actually been a theft from the point of view of a third party.
So what I think might be happening is this; The speaker is trying a little bit too hard to use a slang phrase that they are not familiar with.. or they maybe thinking they have lost their card and are hoping that someone who has found a credit card lying out in the wild or something similar will return it or call them. It is more likely the latter. However, if they know or had experienced something like this then perhaps the second choice is an appropriate choice and it just slipped out accidentally. So I would recommend that you look up the correct term to make sure you are using it correctly, and make it a point to be cautious in your speech/writing for a while and watch for any errors. There is nothing wrong with making an “error” and learning from it, but if you do it all the time without thinking about it then it will become an automatic habit and can affect the way you communicate. A little „self-correcting“ here and there really pays off."

Can You Check If There Were Any Attempts To Use The Card And Obviously Block It?","Considering this utterance: Someone Stole My Wallet Earlier Today, Not Sure Exactly When, Probably On Piccadilly Circus. Can You Check If There Were Any Attempts To Use The Card And Obviously Block It? What is the intent that best describes it?","It seems like a pretty straight forward question, but what do we look for in response to this? How do people talk about their life, their feelings, experiences and the things happening in their day? What are some of the typical things we might ask someone in this context? For our purposes, we will be looking at: a) What does the person want to say, b) How they tell you this, c) And how they want you to react as a result. To this end, let’s start with the first question; what does someone want in a situation like this.

How People Talk About Their Life:
When people ask, “What” they are really looking for a sense of comfort in the conversation. They don‘t want it to be awkward and want their conversation to have a comfortable feel, and to that end they can choose to talk in vague terms that won‚Äôt allow you, or they, in detail. Let‬Ęs look at an example. Suppose the victim has just lost their wallet, so now they will ask a question and their response will allow the listener the chance to give them details, which is good for them, because they aren“™t really feeling comfortable and they know this might give you some clues. But also for us, as detectives, to find some useful insight. So you could imagine the question: „What has happened to your wallet?„Å‍ì¬€ÂœWell, I lost it earlier today, probably on Picadily Circus, can you check if there were any attempts to use it and obviously block it?, òÌÀ‹÷ÒÆÈÏ¾‰¤âÊ¹›âªâŒ­‡­¥â´´Áð´ð Ð´´‷, ÂÜÚâ¨â‖â™‼â® ¦″¨ÝÐµÂ£Â¯‗¨¨ð‛Ó"

I Dont Know How Long It Has Been Missing. Can You See If Maybe Someone Else Has Been Using It?. What is the intent that best describes it? How would a listener infer your purpose? Does the uttering contain some specific request that the recipient do something or be something? What can listeners infer about the hearer's beliefs about their own ability to perform the task? Is there some information you are giving the listener?

1.

I think I lost my credit card, I don't know how long it has been missing, and can you see if maybe someone else has used it. 5.Is it a Compliment?

Do you think the joke is Funny or is it trying too hard and it's just being Boring? 8.How Do You feel?

In this case it would not be a good thing for me, because I would waste time looking. The second alternative of looking and looking in vain would mean that the person does not care that much about her letter and is not too concerned about the fact that it did not arrive. Therefore I do not think that this alternative is a very likely one."

My thoughts are:
The sentence means this person has lost his/her wallet or bag containing their passport and credit/debit cards. Therefore, this sentence conveys that they cannot go shopping or to their workplace due to this situation. And therefore, he/she needs a new card to carry on.
Is this correct?   Is there a better way to understand its meaning? Is it right even to say this? How can it be improved? Thank you
Note: The question is from the exam of a bank. The examiner asked us this. But this is not the question to be answered for this exam. Only to help us with our self-reflection of the questions asked in the exams. This is a test of our reasoning capacity and analytical skills. Thank You. Any suggestions or comments are welcome. Thanks. Cheers. : )
Edited: Thank all you people for the valuable suggestions. All of you are great!!!
P.S. One of your answers was very helpful to me. He suggested, ""I want to change my flight but I need to cancel my stolen credit card as the number is on it.""
This is what I said to the examiner: ""Yes, that's right. It says to him that he cannot buy anything because he was unable to get the credit cards back and because of that, his flight is going to fail or cancel. Or even if this flight did not fail, then the person cannot purchase anything as he has to have the cards because without that it's impossible for him to book anything else. Hence, it would mean that this would not work.""  Thank again. :)
Update: So far, all of them are correct. However, I found a very valuable comment that came from my exam buddy. We were both writing and the only difference was that I was thinking of his answer and he had a different answer. For the benefit of all the candidates of bank exam, here is his comment:  ""There is an alternate explanation for my friend's question and that is because when we cancel the stolen card, the money is still on the card. So in my understanding, a person having the new credit and debit cards can still buy things and therefore travel safely. Just think about all those people that are stranded"
146,Somehow I Am Missing My Card.  What Should I Do?,Considering this utterance: Somehow I Am Missing My Card.  What Should I Do? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What I'm trying to get at is this, in the case of ""I am missing my card"" or ""Someone is stealing my money"", the statement is used to convey a sense of loss/lack of. However, I just can't find a satisfactory way to describe the ""saying that something is missing"" sense. I thought maybe ""a hole is being filled"" but that feels a bit odd as it's more along the lines of a ""missing"" the card, as opposed to filling a hole.
It's also important that I avoid a word like ""deficit"" to imply a lack of money or something else, but I want this to be a single word. This word is very specific to the context of the question, because I am trying not to just say ""this card is not in my wallet/pocket"", I mean really I really am. It's in a specific place, which I will describe, and it really is just gone. So I need to say something along these lines:
""Someone has stolen my X from my Y in some way"". (This is where I feel it should be ""stolen"", because it is taken/taken away)
The question is, what do you think that would be, or are there any other better ways to put it. Should it be said at all, it just feels like it would work well in such a context. The only thing I have thought of is ""it's missing, so it could be lost"", but it still feels strange to use that. Maybe I could make a custom expression for this specific situation, however, that's getting off-topic. Perhaps there's some other word I haven't thought about. Thanks in advance. :)
I don't know if it helps at first, when thinking about such things, try thinking of yourself. You are missing something, you feel an emotion, your card could have been stolen, etc. Then think of it from that perspective. Try to identify a person in your head and see if you can describe that emotion to them. In a similar way, perhaps, describe how you know someone stole your money to your spouse and ask them which words they think best describe your missing money. Just an idea, though. Sorry if this is more or less off topic. My English is quite rusty, at this point I don' t really"
147,My Card Was Taken From Me,Considering this utterance: My Card Was Taken From Me What is the intent that best describes it?,"If you answered the first way, this is not an acceptable answer for the question and should be deleted.
The second is:

It's not that I can't find my card, it's that the person who swiped it
  didn't realize they weren't supposed to take it. He took it to pay for a
> bag of chips but I didn’t order it!
...
I just want a refund. It‘s been over a week, and the card was stolen
from me the day I bought it, so I”m still trying to get it fixed. They
have not responded. I have left messages asking for my replacement
card. So it“s either an oversight or they don‚Äôt know what I am
talking about. Either way I want my money back. This makes me
extremely upset, because I like the store. The cashier was very kind,
and I know the company is trying its best to fix the problem. But I
want the money my credit card is worth, not a replacement. My card
was stolen! I need to be able to use it again before I get another one! ‥

So what does this mean? This one has a couple of different answers:‱‹′
1. You want an apology
2. Something went very wrong with your card. 
As mentioned in the comments on this post, an answer containing a statement like ""I feel sorry for you."" is a very poor answer because it is just a comment about how the asker feels and provides no actual information. While the user may be well-intentioned, providing this information is often done out of an attempt at being kind or understanding, but it provides virtually no information at all."

In the future, I might face the same kind of problem in choosing a sentence. So, please, tell how you would choose the one, for the next time. Thanks in advanced. ;)
Thanks. PPS I am asking this question because I think there are certain things that are universal, and some that vary from one language to another, right? And hence, one should be careful when picking the right words to use in each language. Also, my knowledge is pretty limited, so that may be wrong. Hope you all would agree. :D
PPSS Thanks to all who have answered my questions so far. It's been really helpful!
Update: Here is an example of how I will use the sentence in my assignment: ""I will contact you for your card details within the specified time-frame, Mr/Mrs Smith. Your card was lost and your address is XXX-YYYY""
Edit: To add more about the context: Mr /Mrs. Smith are just nicknames for a customer in a restaurant that we are developing. I hope this helps. (sorry for not mentioning this upfront)  PPPPS The utterings should appear in the dialogue of the story. The customer would be having a chat with the character (me) and I need to make it sound natural. A good way for me to test my sentences before I use them is by writing a dialogue. That's what I did. Please have a look at this and let me know if they sound good. Any suggestions or suggestions to edit them would also be great!!  :)  Thanks. Again.

149,Some Idiot Stole My Card.,Considering this utterance: Some Idiot Stole My Card. What is the intent that best describes it?,"The one that describes that it’s meant to be a threat, a warning or a demand.

Let‘s say that the speaker had the card stolen from him. Is it any of the above:
-It is a simple accusation of wrongdoing with no hint of threat or demand? If so, how should that be taken?
– Is the accusation a direct threat of harm? Is that threat implied and/or intended? Or is there no such threat and it is only meant for public notice? In any case, if the threat exists, is that person a person of good morals and ethics? It is difficult to determine the morals of someone whose intentions are so far-fetched. How does the accused respond? What would his/her actions be if asked to come and explain it to us? We would not want to ask, so the answer is left open-ended. The answer to those questions would reveal a lot about both parties. If we want more information, we ask. Otherwise, the issue is dropped and forgotten. There“s no reason to know anything more about the person in general. We should not even know his name if he were caught. Even if we do know more, there are too many details of his life that would be better left undiscovered. He can always change his mind, his motives, and his morals. But if no one knew anything about his or her motives or motives”s, then it would mean that their only purpose was to publicize and publicise themselves. That would imply they want something. What that might be is not clear. Are they protesting something? Do they have an agenda? Maybe, but we don„t know and that is why we can‛t say if they‚ve acted correctly in this situation. This is just a thought that we‹ve been given to examine. It has no basis of truth. Just an exercise to ponder, to think about. I›m sure that someone out there understands it, or something close to it. In the end, it just means that if it was meant as something other than just an accusation, that something could not be determined. Because we didn‫t hear everything or didn't pay attention or were not given all of that information at that time? That‟s my opinion on this. Thanks to all for helping with this, I really enjoy"

My Card Was With It And I Need A New One Shipped And The Old One Frozen. What is the intent that best describes it?,"A friend sent this to me.. As we get older, I think that we really do have a chance to change, to make the world more beautiful, and our lives more interesting for having been here. So, here's a simple little story.
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. And He did despair, for in His omniscience, He knew that His creations had but three-fifths of the splendor of that which would be IMAIN. Therefore, it grieved Him to contemplate them. But be comforted! For since all He created was very GOOD, except Man, who alone was VERY BAD, only ONE THING was missing to complete the picture -- A Beaver!
Now we have Beaver, but we can't seem to get a straight Answer from you as yet. It's not too bad. I have been in the same position. For the last two years, the only way I've been able to buy my medication is to write a check. Then I go to the bank, pay the check and go home to wait for a cashier. Now I can wait at home while the druggist ships me the pills and I write the prescription on a little piece of paper, then hand the paper to another drugger, wait to be handed pills in exchange then go back to pay that person cash. The process is very frustrating and time consuming but it is a lot easier than driving to and from the pharmacy. If all the pharmacies had to ship to a single site, you and me and others might be more satisfied. We would also have to have an adequate parking lot. A few more things like this are not a bad idea, like a good, cheap, fast, reliable transportation system. When you can buy and consume anything anytime, without waiting for shipping, delivery or payment, what is left to complain about? And what happens to our precious resources."
153,I Believe My Credit Card Was Stolen.,Considering this utterance: I Believe My Credit Card Was Stolen. What is the intent that best describes it?,"What do YOU believe is his intent? Why? (Please provide a couple of lines explaining your reasoning).
The intent I chose was I believe the credit card was stolen. It does not matter that it was a credit and that I do not believe it is mine, it could still be my credit or it may have been a gift or something like that, and still would not necessarily be the card that was my intent. Also it does matter how that card got on that particular table. I did not choose the specific card as I have not read all the cards as they get pulled off the table and put on the floor, so that could have happened before he got the box on there.
Now, why would it matter if it were a cash card or a debit card, I mean he was going to use them, he would have stolen the money, wouldn't he? My guess is that the person that stole the cash cards would be stealing the physical cards to get the pin numbers, thus the debit cards get stolen so the thief can take out a bit more money. He could take the amount of money he wanted out of the ATM, take a small amount out from the store he went in. The thief would still have the number of cards, they do have a number that corresponds to the numbers they put the stolen cards into, if that is what he did. Then, the question is, is this card number the ""intent""?
Or could this be just the last card he chose? He chose a card because it had a dollar amount on it, which is usually what a thief will put into his or her account. This is where the questions get tricky, because he may not have even known if the other ones he put in there were stolen, unless he knew someone was swiping. Thus he just randomly selects a few and then put them on this table? Again, my guess would that he could be trying to take more than what the initial amount he started out with, or he thought that since it has already been reported stolen he doesn't have to worry about getting caught with it. Or again, maybe his idea was just to make the police think that they just swiped it from this person's table, without having to steal it or even have them give it back. Maybe it's like a game, where he can see how many people swipe his card and see if he thinks he gets"
154,How Do I Report A Stolen Card?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Report A Stolen Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is the person reporting the loss in doubt of what they are reporting; in denial of the stolen card issue; feeling victimized and looking for someone to blame?

You might be thinking:
Is there any other way to answer that question? How do I report a stolen credit card? You can read on for the answers and you will see it's not that difficult to find, and it all boils down to one thing: Reporting a theft and getting a new credit or debit card is easy if you just follow the steps.
There are two types of stolen cards. The first kind is a card which has been stolen, but it is still active and used by the thief. It is reported to the credit reporting companies who then update your credit report as if it had never been used. When you apply for a loan, mortgage, or credit to buy something, that credit will not be pulled back. You will only be notified of any new accounts opened. In other words, when dealing with your stolen account, you have full access to your account and credit and debit cards, although there may be fees if the card has already been reported as stolen. If the new card or account is used fraudulently, a fraud alert will be added immediately which will then trigger a freeze placed on the cards; the fraudulent purchases will have to be done on cash. That is one of two ways to prevent the account from being used without your consent again. Once the freeze is lifted, the accounts and cards will once again be usable, just as they were the last time you logged in. All you need is your old card and the information you used to set up the fraud alerts. These are called security freeze cards for stolen debit and/or credit. We use these every day here and can tell you they work as advertised. However, we are not recommending that you do not file a report with the police. Please read our article regarding filing a police report to read the advantages of this approach. Another option is to file with a credit agency and ask your bank to place a limit on your cards so you can not use them again, especially if they have been lost, stolen or are used with an expired credit/ debit number. This is known as a temporary suspension and is placed at the request of another party. Banks have their reasons for asking for this. For example, they may want to freeze the line of credit for 60 to"
155,"Somebody Has Stolen My Card, I Need Help Please.","Considering this utterance: Somebody Has Stolen My Card, I Need Help Please. What is the intent that best describes it?","It is probably not very hard to make a list of what the different words could refer to. But how many people could make that list in 5 minutes? What about in a few days, a week? And after a day or two, how easy is it to recall and apply those words to a new instance when the need arises? I would think there is no easy answer to that.
What I was getting at is that it is really hard for the average person to grasp the idea of intent. It requires some understanding of the context, the other possible meanings of words as well as how to understand the language itself. I believe most people have the same struggle every day, even if they are able to communicate effectively. The fact is, there are so many words, and so much of them have multiple meanings, that unless we have done extensive study of language and have read a lot of books, we would probably struggle to figure it out. In some ways, it’s like the difference of reading books from someone who speaks the original language. We may understand a little of how that language works, but we are not nearly as familiar with our own language, so we can understand some of its quirks just as a second language learner can, though to truly grasp that, one would need to be immersed in the system for at least a decade. Even then, without that immersion, they may not even understand that they have a problem as they think they know what is going on. That‘s a big part of why I love the concept of teaching language through games, because you can introduce this idea very quickly in games. You can use the example of my own life to get some traction. When I started using English, my first problem was that I had some difficulty understanding the nuances of some words. For instance, if I wrote a sentence like: “The book is in my bedroom”, people would read that as me asking them to look in one direction. While I could say the actual words in that sentence, ‘book“ and ”bedroom‡, most readers would have no idea that those were the directions I actually wanted to go. There is some room for interpretation, which I am sure you have all experienced at some point. This is not a bad thing, just an interesting way the brain works. Because of this, you need an environment that"
156,I Cannot Find My Credit Card.,Considering this utterance: I Cannot Find My Credit Card. What is the intent that best describes it?,"A. To ask for help finding the lost cardB. to ask the clerk to give the card to a customerC. I will try to find the credit card for youD.I will look for the missing card
For question (A), since the use of ""I"" and ""me"" implies that it is about YOU, it doesn't fit in this conversation. The only way the sentence could fit is if someone asked you to get the money for them from this person, and they then ask you for that person's card, which is a completely different conversation!
So, for questions (B), ""Ask the Customer"" seems like the right answer, but it would be better if you used a formal word instead of 'customer.' The other person would then understand that you're talking with them.
Question (C) seems to mean that he is going to go over to the counter to try and find it, so ""try"" is correct there, since you have to do anything on your own. Question (D) is also correct. You are talking about your intent, ""What is your intention?"" is one way you ask that, another would also be ""what is it [your intent]"".
I hope this helps! =)

157,Are You Able To Locate My Card?,Considering this utterance: Are You Able To Locate My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"If you’re not sure, take it a step further by asking: What”s Your Intent? This helps you clarify your thoughts before speaking. When you ask, What? what exactly do you intend? and When You Ask, Where? or When? What do I intend for you, me, everyone? Then ask What Now?, What next?, and what can you do? (You don‘t have to ask what I can‖you can simply respond with: You can do whatever you can.)

The following examples demonstrate how you could ask your partner what the answer to Are you Able to Located My Credit Card is, what‚s your intent, how can we move forward and then ask for the outcome. I believe that the intention of each person in the relationship is what drives us as individuals. Intention in my opinion should be the foundation of every conversation. It should drive the action of the conversation, not the words, thoughts or emotions expressed, or the other‒s emotions.
As you practice saying “I love you.“ repeat it slowly. You should try to put a genuine feeling into it for a more realistic and enjoyable experience. To say it sincerely can be really enjoyable, but just as important is to use it correctly. Saying it wrong or with a wrong intention, for example, just to appear nice or say that, can create tension between you and your loved one. The more you repeat ‚""I Love you"", without trying to impress him, the more likely he‟ll start repeating back to you the same phrase. So, make the statement as sincere as possible. Say „I„ ‹Love you!› and don't say †""just for show""‡. This is very important‰you‹ve got to feel it!
There are many ways to go about finding your true love on the Internet. If there is a dating site that you have been wanting to try out but haven‛t had the time, try it now. With so many sites to choose from, you might find that a site you had not considered is perfect for what you are hoping to do. In addition to the sites mentioned in this book (eHarmony.com, Match.Com, Yahoo Personals, Dateline, etc.), you may also want to look for some"
158,My Card Got Stolen!,Considering this utterance: My Card Got Stolen! What is the intent that best describes it?,"If you think of what you want to say, it would be very obvious that you’re referring to the card you used to make the purchase of a drink for someone else. But if you really stop and think about it, you wouldn‘t actually want the person who stole your card to know that he stole it. I mean, if that person uses it to pay for something else then he would have no way of knowing if somebody else took it from him. It is just a card.
In this example, the utterances are all about the same, but the way in which the cards were used makes a huge difference. You can“t use it in another way, as a different kind of thing.” It would only be reasonable to use this card in the context of buying a gift, because that․s the purpose for which it was issued. If you use the example of getting your money stolen, or being attacked, then it does not belong in this context, and therefore it cannot be used there. (As far as the other example goes, there„ s still no clear winner.)
What the examples show you is how the different meanings depend on what the meaning of the verb is. In this case, they are about making use of, taking, being used… In most cases, this distinction is not important. When the word in focus is used in more than one way (and in some other languages, one meaning is predominant), then the difference can be important, like in German, where you can have different verbs that mean something like:
to steal an item (which is usually called lahmgehtsakt),
a piece of cloth that someone stole (the word is stahlgebäck), and
the act of stealing in general (stealgehen).
This is called polysemy. The German verb lassen “to be lenient‛ has two different senses (I‚ d be more lenience than the one you have, while the latter meaning would give rise to an entirely different verb, which is „I d let‰
A third type is homonymy, a word of similar sound (a ”m‹ in English) can mean many things in similar ways (› m‬, ‹ m ’,  m ). For example in Polish"
159,Help Me Please!  My Card Was Stolen!,Considering this utterance: Help Me Please!  My Card Was Stolen! What is the intent that best describes it?,"The only thing I can think of is that this person is desperate for help and needs someone to do something for them, and they're begging for it. But, is this the right interpretation? I've looked it up in a few dictionaries, but I'm not sure it actually means to beg.
I could be wrong, so maybe it also could mean to try to help someone that just doesn't want to be helped. Or maybe there's some other explanation for this that I haven't considered. 
Can I use the following as an appropriate interpretation in this situation? ""Help me please, my card was stolen. It's very important to me that it be replaced!""
What is a more appropriate way of saying what I mean? Should I say ""You've got to get it [replaced]! The card that is!""? Would I sound weird if I said, ""Hey man, you've gotta get that [card] replaced, please""?
Any other options I could use for such a situation that make more sense?   Any feedback is most appreciated. Thank You!
Note: I am a novice, trying to learn to speak English. I have taken a lot of grammar classes in high school, such as writing. My question is about the way I would explain it to someone who's asking for assistance. If this is an English forum, perhaps you could tell me in your answer if you believe that my sentence should be said to mean help me, or if the correct way would be to say help my, instead. Please correct me or point me to an answer that would help. Thanks! I hope your responses are as helpful as I'd like them to become. :-)
Here's that sentence again, if it helps:  Help me (please) my (card) was (stolen).
Update: Thanks for the advice, guys. Your answers were helpful. For anyone interested, here's my final version of the sentence, after the suggestions from @Juan Manuel Correa, @Glorfindel,  @FumbleFingers, etc:
Help please. Someone took my credit card today, it's important for me for my wallet to have the card (replaces the one that was taken), do you know a place that could do this for free, in my neighborhood or in another? Thank you very much for reading. :)"
160,How Old Do I Need To Be To Get An Account For Myself,Considering this utterance: How Old Do I Need To Be To Get An Account For Myself What is the intent that best describes it?,"This is really just a question with a bunch of presuppositions. I don't think there is any definitive answer to ""How old do you have to be to get a credit card or debit card?"". It's an open ended question depending on how you interpret it, and it's impossible to come up with definitive answers because there are no concrete answers in the real world.
You could ask the question, ""What is a young creditable?"" and then the answer would be different on the basis of a number of things. For example, the age of the person you're asking it of will affect the answers, but that's only one factor. The answer will also depend on if they are asking the young person or if the older or middle-aged person is being referred to by the younger individual. It may depend who they think ""I"" is. If two people are talking, one of them can ask ""Hey what's your sign?"". The person being asked might say ""Libra, that doesn't work on me, I'm a Pisces"". The other person doesn’t ask, they just accept the information that the other was born under a sign not of their own. 
So, even with this question there may be no definitive right answer, at least in regards to credit/debit cards."
161,How Young Can I Be To Open My Own Account?,Considering this utterance: How Young Can I Be To Open My Own Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"a : the intended meaning of a message, statement, etc.
b : a meaning that is not intended
I have a strong intuition that b is correct, I just can’t think of any reason that anyone would use it, especially a young person. So I was wondering if there are any rules governing which of these are correct? 
For example:
How young can you be to open your own business account in your name?”   (b)
“How old can he be that he can open a checking account? “ (a) 

 
Are both sentences grammatically correct in the context given? If so, why (if you can answer this one you may be able to answer the other question too) and is there any difference in meaning between both of them, other than the one that ‘a‘ seems to convey an intention of ’not-too-young‟? Thanks!
*Update: I have also posted this on „The Cambridge Dictionary Blog„
Update2: It‚s a little bit of an interesting discussion, but I don›t see the question as being on-topic for the site.  So, if it is a ‚grammatical‰ question I suggest that you move your question to English Language and Usage. Thanks."
162,How Old Do I Have To Be?,Considering this utterance: How Old Do I Have To Be? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Why is this person trying to communicate, and what do they hope to get across to you?

How Old do you Have to be to Have a Heart by the way? by aaron
The first part is a rhetorical question. The speaker is asking if the listener has ""a heart"" and is trying
to determine if he/she is qualified to judge.
""How old do I look to to have a heart?""
the speaker then is using ""How do old I have to look?"" this is rhetorical in that the speaker's opinion is
not necessarily relevant. He/She is just using it to try to make a point. It sounds like he is either looking
or asking. And since he asked, I feel he's saying that. So, it depends. If he wants to say ""Are you qualified
(to speak), or is it just that you happen to ask."" He is looking. and, he does not want to hear the answer. As
for the heart, the question has nothing to do with age. ""have a"" is like a verb. In the sentence how old is/was,
this is how the phrase is being used. That is, when we use a question with the modality ""was"" or ""is"" it means
we want or are asking about it's previous status. I think the best interpretation of the whole thing is that
he wants the other person to answer if she has or has not got a ""heart"".
I agree with what you say about the meaning. Although, that depends on what he actually wants us to
do. For example, if you are talking to a person who does believe there is no God, this question will likely be
used in a way that says ""I want you to think about whether or not you really do have an ""intellect"" to determine
if there really is an 'I'; and if there's an I, then how can I not have ""myself"" which is what makes me, me
and the I in the universe.""
To me the most obvious meaning is ""You can have this 'intellectual' (or whatever) for a very short time."" The
other meaning could simply be ""are you able to understand?"" If that's the first one, ""the heart' refers to the
person with ""that"" intellect and ""what he has"
163,Can I Open An Account For A Child?,Considering this utterance: Can I Open An Account For A Child? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it an open-ended question that is likely to be responded with a definitive answer? Or is it a question whose answer is only known to the person who is being asked?

The answer depends on many things:
1. The person being ask,
2. Who may be asking, and, even more important, the relationship between the two people. It could be a very different set of questions and answers if a parent was asking this to a bank customer representative, than if it was a business owner asking to an employee, a customer service representative asking a call center operator or a sales person asking the potential new customer.
For example, let's assume the first of those three scenarios: a person asks a colleague in the company they work for ""Can I open an account for a child"", and that person is not a banker, nor a financial person nor someone with any other type of responsibility or authority in relation to accounts or banking. That person's colleague responds, ""sure I can open the account, what is her name and the name of their father?"", ""Is she a girl or boy?"", and ""Where do they live?"". 
So, in those circumstances, if someone is asking for permission to open a savings account account or to apply for credit cards, or for something else that a potential customer might be able to do, then it is most likely better to answer ""no"", since the bank or credit union is under no obligation to provide credit to such a client, especially if there is no contract between both parties. However, such an answer may seem rude or abrupt if the intention is simply to ask this question as an expression of interest by the speaker in doing something that they think would be of benefit. But it may very well be acceptable to say ""No"" with an attempt to clarify and understand the request, because, of course, it would have been better not to make that statement in that scenario!"
164,How Old Do We Have To Be?,Considering this utterance: How Old Do We Have To Be? What is the intent that best describes it?,"To provide you an age requirement for when you can start dating as a couple (and have sex).
OR
The best ages for a relationship.
or both? 
How can one best be explained? and the other? And how should they be used in everyday conversation? Would the first be seen as an attempt at a joke? How about the latter? What would this type of sentence look like in the most common situations? I'm specifically referring to the kind of sentences you'd hear in, say, a high school hallway, or during lunchtime at work (for the sake of clarity - I understand that they might be slightly more formal in nature). I've also read the sentence in a book that has a similar tone but it doesn't really fit the context. So I thought I'd ask here on ELU.  (I think that the last point is worth noting: what I really want to know is how this sentence is interpreted in general and what is meant by ""in general"" in this context, i.e. how does a sentence like this make you feel when hearing it?)
Examples
There are of course examples that have been discussed here, but what makes them so effective at conveying the intended meaning? Does one example tend to mean one thing and another one something else? Are any specific examples most appropriate for any circumstance? If, for example I told a friend that I was ""looking for someone who is between 40-50 years old for serious relationships, that is to say marriage"" I think my friend would have no difficulty understanding the meaning of that expression. But I also think I would be able to express this much more elegantly. Is ""someone who's old enough for the long term"" the best expression? (in my opinion it seems like a much better one - the reason being that there is also a word 'old' here). Is it possible to convey it without using the word? For instance, if I said to a group of friends that ""I want a serious relationship that's the same in depth level as my parents had at the age of 30-35."" (or something like that). Would that make sense? The reason I brought up 'the same level' is so that everyone will agree that it's in fact'serious' and it really isn't a casual date with a potential future husband (though that would also be appreciated). In fact"
165,How Do I Go About Setting Up An Account For My Daughter?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Go About Setting Up An Account For My Daughter? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it to show the steps in setting up an account? Are you trying to help her or yourself? Does she know what to expect? If I have more then 50 people and have a website, do I need several accounts or just one for the site? How do you handle this issue?

In this video I explain what an online store is and what the best ways are to use WordPress to start your online presence. If you’re thinking of starting an e-commerce website to sell your own products – you can learn from me how to get started quickly and effectively. This video will give you an idea of how you go about starting and operating an Online store. So let‘s jump in the video and see what it is that I can teach you in this course.
I've had many different online businesses over my career. I was in ebay a few years, and sold on craigs-list before that, but I didn't learn a ton from my experience in those spaces. In fact, I made a bunch of dumb mistakes which could have been prevented if I had known better. One thing which I really learned from was setting the price of the item too low, when I started out. Once I discovered how much competition a product was going to face, my profit margin, the actual cost of producing it, etc., I set the prices much higher. You can't be lazy at the beginning. It will bite you if you start the next day. There's a fine line between not pricing it aggressively enough when you're just starting out and being so cheap that you'll lose money. But, don't go too high at first either. And be prepared, if your first product/service is successful, there will be much more competition for your services/product down the line (which will make it even tougher to make a profit).
You can build online stores as an affiliate or as a merchant. The best thing about online affiliate stores is they are usually very easy to set up. They have no maintenance and can be managed from anywhere in world. All you have to do is place your affiliate code at relevant pages and make sure the merchant does the sales. For example, you place it on your website and your visitors click on the affiliate links and it takes them to the respective merchants. That way, they make sale and you make money as the referral."
166,Is There An Age Minimum?,Considering this utterance: Is There An Age Minimum? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What would be the best title for this article? ""Is there an age minimum?"" is pretty generic and might even come across as insulting. On the other hand, ""Are teenagers mature enough to vote?"" has nothing to do with the answer to the original question.
I've been thinking about this, and I'm not really sure what to title it. It's about ""intent"" and ""context"".
So, is there a specific age (or other criteria) at which we can say that a teenager is ""too young""?
If we use ""teenager"" synonymously with ""minor"", how mature is an adult? Do adults get any more ""age-appropriate"" after a certain age? How do we determine when an individual is no longer capable of making ""responsible adult"" decisions (as well as being allowed to legally vote, etc)? 
Are there examples of age-related changes in behavior?   For example, how do teenagers behave differentially from adults? In what ways are adults' behavior more or less affected by their age, if at all? (I'm asking from a social science/psychological perspective).
To be more clear about what I want to know, I think the question is: ""what are some age limits for the ability to be legally regarded as a'responsible' adult that are determined solely by one's age?""
Thanks for your help.  :)
PS: I know this is a very basic question, but I couldn't find anything more specific via Google. Hopefully we're not all asking the same thing. I don't know what ""on the face of it"" questions mean, so please explain if I've asked one. ;)
EDIT: It was pointed out that I asked for general questions. So, what's an example of a question that's specifically about an ""adulthood"" or ""maturation"" limit based solely on age that one would ask? I'd like to clarify the difference between my question and these. The question I linked to asked ""is there something inherent that makes a person mature"".  The answer is, in a general way yes, yes there is. But I was specifically referring to an objective age limit. (This is where I get off-topic because I do not want someone to give me a psychological definition of maturation.)  I also linked the one that was a ""face of things"""
167,What Is The Youngest Age In Order To Have An Account?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Youngest Age In Order To Have An Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"A lot of the times it is about making a profit, as in a business or marketing. It may or may not be about what is actually the right age, and what will best benefit someone.
It is also a fact that a lot more people make a sale at a younger than an older age. A lot less people are actually successful at an advanced age than they are at younger. I have never heard someone who was very successful after the age of 55. Even if the person was successful they were not able or willing to share their knowledge and how they achieved. That being said there are some people that do continue to learn, even into old age and have a successful career. But for the most part it’s easier, if not more lucrative to make the sale before an age has passed. Some people have said that it takes 10 years to become a professional. There is no true data of what that means for success. If it meant 10 year for a person to reach a certain level of knowledge or skill it may be true. Or maybe it means 10 YEARS of experience. The 10 is more of a guideline not a true figure. People start making sales at very young a age too. They get their start as a kid, or young adult. So what can be done about this fact. How can we make our sales to older people so that we can sell them. This is something we should all consider. We as sellers need to be able to help those who are older, to continue with there life. When someone sells something that makes them happy, they often are able and willing and happy to sell it to someone that is younger or older than them self. Because if they sell something they love they will always want to have other people get to enjoy it as well."

What is the intent that best describes it?,"This is an actual question I get a lot as a writer, and it drives me nuts. I know that this is more a “writing” question than a writing advice question. But I think this question is about writing and editing, so maybe I can put this out in the wild and see what happens.
For those of you not familiar, there’s a book I wrote several years ago called Writing Fiction. The title is what makes this a weird question: It‘s actually a little book about how to write fiction in general. At the end of that book, I list the rules I“ve observed about what age to be.

It is a good question and the one that you will need to ask yourself when you hear this term being used. If it is used in a sentence it can be used to mean something in the following way:
I opened this account for my daughter. (or) I gave her this money. To have (that is, to have something or to do something, in this case, open a bank, brokerage, mutual fund, retirement account) something."
170,What Is The Minimum Age To Open An Account?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Minimum Age To Open An Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What is your answer? If it is in line with the intention of the original poster, this would most likely be considered as an appropriate question.
However, the most popular answer would probably be this one. I have personally asked similar questions to my colleagues and my answers were:
- This is not a valid question because the topic is too broad,
or
This isn't a good place to ask this question
and  
Is this an offtopic question?  (or similar answers)"
171,What Is The Minimum Age?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Minimum Age? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What do you think it means to the questioner? How would you express this intent?

It's quite possible the intention is to be provocative (to get attention, or maybe to get a reaction - or a slap in the face), or to make an inflammatory statement in order to cause the reader to respond. Either way, it seems an odd way to phrase the first question.
To answer it in an appropriate manner - without the author's intention - is quite difficult to do, so I will not comment."

173,Could I Open An Account For My Children?,Considering this utterance: Could I Open An Account For My Children? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is your mind already thinking that you would like to open a credit card for a young child and help out the family in some way?

If you are the parent of a little one with financial responsibility, you understand that managing money on the home budget can be a chore. If you’d like a quick and easy way for your young children to learn the basics of investing, starting from the youngest age possible, I would suggest opening up one of these online investment accounts for little ones.
This is a great way to introduce young kids to the world of finance without going all out and getting them their own savings account with interest and all. Instead, they can learn about how their parents or guardian manage and invest their money by watching over their back, while they grow up! There are some great ways to teach them about financial education and it‘s important to start early. The only way you can teach your kids about the importance of saving is by teaching them yourself!
With these savings plans for young savers, there is no need to wait for them to turn eighteen to get started! They can open their investment account and begin investing with their very first deposit! With a kid's savings plan, the child can get to know the concept of money and saving for the future without being scared off by the thought of losing all of their savings or getting hurt or even worse. There is nothing that is more important during your teen years than understanding the value of learning the essentials of personal finance. A savings bond or certificate of deposit is perfect for kids who would benefit from starting with investing. They are both easy to make, simple to buy and are not as scary as opening out one‚Äôs own account, right from when they are young. You are giving them the opportunity to grow into their finances in a way that will benefit them for life. These accounts are available all over the place, including at banks, credit unions and online. Some sites you might want to consider are:
YouthSaver.com
Vanguard.gov.au
Tavey.org.uk
CiticorpKids.ca
Sallie Mae.edu
Investing 101.us.kids-savings.net
The best part of this process is that a savings certificate or savings bank account for children is not only fun and motivating, but it also teaches the kid important financial concepts"
174,What Is The Age To Open An Account?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Age To Open An Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is It:
A) A question that is asking for help
B) An order for someone else to do something
C) Something that could be interpreted as an order or a question
D) Nothing in the content or tone
E) All of the above
F) None of this is true
Answer: The best interpretation I can come up with is (B). The speaker is telling the listener that they need to open an account with the bank (or another organization). There is no question posed and the speaker isn’t really expecting any reply.
In this case, (C), (E), and (F), are incorrect because the utterances doesn‘t tell the “audience” anything. The only one that has anything to tell, it the audience, is A. However, this answer is incorrect. An utterence that doesn't have an intent, doesnot have the ability to be answered. If we were trying to get the meaning of ‘the age to…“, then (A),(D),and (G) would be correct answers. For now, there aren't an actual answers to the questions, therefore there are no ”intent„ answers either. Therefore (D, F, and G) are correct and „none of these is really true‟. But what do you think the actual answer will be? Please feel free to answer any question, but if it‚s about grammar please do not answer. You will not get points for the grammar answer, however, you may get an ‚extra credit‛ (like a free pizza).

175,How Do I Open Up An Account For My Child?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Open Up An Account For My Child? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it: ""I have a child who I am very worried about. I need to find them a new school."" OR Is It: I want to open up a business account or an email account for my child
OR Is it to ""find them the best school they want"".
It may be a combination of all three or more.
How do I know which of these would be appropriate? 
I would appreciate any insights you could offer.   I'm just not quite sure how to proceed. We are in the process of moving from Florida to Texas and will be staying here for the most part of the year. Our oldest child just turned 12. The school he goes to now is a great and wonderful school, and we are extremely happy with the principal. However, he really doesn't like the school's schedule. Since he is only in sixth grade, we were wondering if there was any other school that would work better. Unfortunately, due to the schedule, I don't think that we would like another one in his elementary school. But, it is not a bad school either. It's the schedules that he doesn;t like. So, the plan is for him to go to a different school for seventh and eighth grades. This school looks like it will work out really great for our son. BUT, his first two years in our new town. He has an opportunity to have the same school as his brother. How do we go about this, without going against our morals? His older brother will probably go in 6th grade. His younger brother is in 3rd grade and would go back to first. (He started kindergarten)
Any advice from you or anyone would really be appreciated!
Thanks in advance!  :)
*I am not posting this from my phone, sorry for typos! *
UPDATE: Sorry I forgot to add this:
We are also looking to buy a house. If we buy in this town, our kids will all probably attend this school because they are ""neighborhood"" schools. That is how the district does it. Even though the other schools are not necessarily better than this one, they seem better suited to my husband's child with ADD and the others are better for me. Anyway, how do all these go through? Are we allowed for this to be discussed on a forum? Sorry this was so long!"

You are being sarcastic.
2
This is an example of an adverb. “He went through the town like a tornado”
3
“That boy is a very lucky boy.’‘
4a He says it because he is happy for this boy and wants to show how happy he really is. It expresses approval and is in a way a compliment. A more direct way to express the same would be: ‘He is really lucky.'„
5a „He says that to his girlfriend because she has done something for him that makes him happy. He wants her to know he thinks highly of what she does for people, not because of her looks. That is why he gives her this compliment‟. This is similar to an ’emotional compliment'. [3]
6a That‚s the most beautiful thing I have ever seen‹ This man is complimenting an object and he›s telling what he sees as a good quality. [2] The difference is that in the first sentence it‌s about one person who feels happy, and in this one it is about something that is pleasing to the eye. In the second sentence the emotion is expressed by the person s tone of voice; here it comes in through his eyes ¹‍
7a
That‡ is so true that  It‧ is surprising he would tell that about me  ” The man wants his friend to agree with his opinion of his new girlfriend. However, he isn  ‥ ‛‮  t say this ‚‗‰ to her directly because that would probably mean that he doesn‫… ‬doesn‬t feel comfortable around her, which would imply he feels he has to be careful. Therefore he chooses not to talk about her in front of someone else. 
So, when someone tells you how old they are, what is their intent behind telling you the age? Are they expressing approval or disapproval, or is it simply being informative? Why would the speaker want you to understand their answer? Would it be more suitable to reply in terms of agreement or disagreement? If you were a person, how would you express it to another person that you found them older than you"

Sell
B. Sell
C. To
D. Offer
E. Make
The best answer would be B, but the others are also acceptable. If it is A, the question may be referring to a service that one is able to pay to obtain money in advance. In this case, it should read as Sell. However, if it were intended as an offer to do this service in a way that is not a commercial transaction, I believe the best option is E."
179,If My Kids Wanted To Use Your Service How Old Would They Have To Be?,Considering this utterance: If My Kids Wanted To Use Your Service How Old Would They Have To Be? What is the intent that best describes it?,"And what is it called?

A:
The best way I can describe this is that it’s a rhetorical question. It‘s an implied question, but there‒s no question mark. The implication is something like “If my kids wanted to” or „What if my kid wanted“. 
So you could call it a statement, or even a question (because of the lack of punctuation), or you can even call this a form of rhetorical questions, like it's not asking a real question so there's no answer, just implied.
To be clear: This question is rhetorical because there is simply no actual answer to it. There might be an answer if you were to specify how you‟d imagine it to be answered. But for the sake of brevity, I'm going to assume that the question has no real answer because you'd want your kids to use your services, not just because they're ‒ or more likely ‘- older."
180,Can My 19 Year Old Daughter Open A Savings Account At The Bank?,Considering this utterance: Can My 19 Year Old Daughter Open A Savings Account At The Bank? What is the intent that best describes it?,"In this question, the context of the utterances is about opening a savings account with a financial institution. The speaker wants to know if his daughter (19 years old) can open a personal savings with the bank and deposit some money.
This is one of my favorites for teaching how to think about grammar. And the answer to the problem is simple; the second phrase: 
1. is a modifier and it modifies ""My wife.""
2. the whole phrase is being used as a noun and the noun is ""daughter."""
181,How Old Do You Have To Be To Get An Account?,Considering this utterance: How Old Do You Have To Be To Get An Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This is a great question to answer so here it is, let's begin with an example.

This is an utterances which has two possible grammatical structures based on our analysis. The first and most obvious is:
(a) How old do you have to be to get an account?
The second one is;
 (b) When do I need to register to vote to qualify for an election? (Or)
In most cases we prefer the first, for example, we would not say: I am going to apply to the account now. (It would be more likely to say that when I have applied, I will get my account.) So, based upon this information, there were two possibilities; one of them is grammatically incorrect. We can use the grammar checker or grammarly (http://www.grammarly.com/), or we can ask a native speaker to check our work for us. Grammar checkers can also be very useful with more complex utterations, if you don't have time for a thorough proofread. Another thing is that sometimes grammar errors may be caused by using a different language and a more common language. For example: In a sentence: Do you know what I think of you?, the ""I"" should be written in the form of I + ""think of"": Do I know that you think about me?, and if this is our case, then we have an issue. I hope that this explanation was useful and we learned something from this."
182,What'S The Minimum Age For Opening An Account?,Considering this utterance: What'S The Minimum Age For Opening An Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"In what form would it most likely be used?

For many people, when they hear about the minimum age requirement for opening an account, they immediately think of credit cards and the need to verify that you are over a certain age. In fact, it has nothing to do with cards. It's a question with respect to the opening of a checking account or a savings account.


This can come across in two different ways, the first being the way I've seen it presented as a rule. The second way is to ask yourself, ""What's the purpose of minimum requirement in the account?""
It's probably not about your age, because, you could be 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, or even older. And the question is, why would a bank care about that.
So what's it about?"
183,"I Would Like An Account For My Children, How Do I Go About Doing This?","Considering this utterance: I Would Like An Account For My Children, How Do I Go About Doing This? What is the intent that best describes it?","The sentence may have been spoken with the intention of getting information on the best method for transferring money. The next time they have money in their pockets, it will be easier for them in order to transfer money to you. On the other hand, the speaker may desire to make certain that their children are given money at the time of birth.

In the following sentences the pronoun will have to be replaced by who. Who will transfer who's money? How do I get money into my account? Will you transfer my money or is there a limit on how much of my deposit I can have transferred?
It has to mean, who will put my/their money where my or their money is? What does it mean? It is a statement meaning: Who, will make the decision to move my, or your, money from one account to another. It means the transfer will move the money out of one place to a different place. In the case of money, one's bank account. This is called moving money because it takes money and moves it to/from another place or account with one of your banks. So, if one person (who is your bank) says 'I will send your money', the second person says, ""Okay, I will receive your (money)"".
You are right. To make money we have got to work, but in the sense that to gain wealth, we need to have a source of income. Wealth is different from money/money value of assets. We must have the source to accumulate wealth. I'm not going to get rich by working in a company that I cannot sell. Even if I manage to sell the company, that will not help to become rich. Rich in our world means to posses material objects such as land and building and not only the monetary value. Money will help us become richer but not to acquire wealth/wealthiness. A car does not make one rich, because the value is just a measure of wealth rather than the wealth itself. If we are rich and are living in comfort, then money has lost its significance. But if we cannot get anything by money alone, i.e. if there is no source for it, e.g. no job, there will remain no reason to value money as the only source. There will arise a reason for our existence other than money!

184,Can My Children Have Their Own Account?,Considering this utterance: Can My Children Have Their Own Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I am considering it with the following thoughts in mind:
1. The kids may want to play with and use another social media site besides Facebook.
2. If there is a need to be ""protected"" from the social networking sites for some reason, it can be accomplished with parental controls or filtering software. For example, if the family is connected to their bank via their account information, that would require a password. And the password would be a requirement for use of the Facebook account. But this would also be the one password that allows access to every other account the kids have on Facebook or any other social network site. So they can't have their own account, as each account must be logged into from a single login. I'm thinking a combination of both methods might be better so the parents wouldn't be concerned about protecting their kids with one of these methods. 
3. It might not be worth it to spend the time and money on an account for the little ones when they will only be using Facebook for school, family, or friends to ""friend"". In addition, the account would have to have all of their information. There's just no reason not to keep the information on the parent or grandparent account since they would still control what information is allowed for that account and all their other accounts with Facebook, Google, etc. Plus, having a parent to control these accounts would make them more accountable for what these kids are doing. They could also set limits for certain aspects (number of friends, number of updates that can post, time online, viewing content, accessing certain applications, and so on.)
4. Some people don't think this is necessary for these purposes. In fact, they think it's a waste of time for children. Is it necessary or are these thoughts correct?"

Or C: My company wants to send money for their education to my kids' college.

This question can also be used in the reverse. You can think of it as if I ask you to name your kids, what would it mean? To name, and the best answer would be ""my parents"". The next best would have been ""a family friend"". However, none of those would mean anything at all without a context. If I am talking with my parents at the dinner table, those are the answers that we expect. The same is true in your case, as you are thinking of opening an IRA for your children, not ""set up"" an ""account"" for them or something you expect them to be able to use to purchase stocks."

187,How Old Do You Have To Be To Be Able To Open An Account?,Considering this utterance: How Old Do You Have To Be To Be Able To Open An Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is
the speaker asking for the age, or stating it as a fact?

To open an account is a very important task, not as an end in itself. The person is looking for a specific
result - to open a checking account; it is not about the account, but rather about getting a result.
This sentence is in the Present Progressive Tense form, so we need to use the present perfect tense for our answer. We need the
past tense because this is an example where we are talking about an action that has been completed already; we do not want to ask
about the action, since it has already happened. This is also the reason for changing the question to ""How old
do you have to be to..."". A better question would be:
""What is your age now?""
If the person has just turned 18 or 21, then he may not be able to do this. There are some exceptions to this, depending on
what country you are speaking about, as the regulations differ depending upon where you live in this world. Check your
country's laws for specifics on this issue. So, what does this tell you about using Present Tenses? It tells
you that the result - ""To
open an
account..."" - is more important than the act of opening the accounts."
188,Is There An Age Limit?,Considering this utterance: Is There An Age Limit? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is there a age limit in the sense of a maximum of time a member can stay on the site at any given time, or is it a limit on activity that is not limited to an age? To me, it's obvious that ""the limits"" are ""to do or not to do"" and the age is what you feel you should feel ""qualified"" to ""do"" in a given day.
In other words, if you have no age or ""qualifications"" (as an adult or in any way, as a child), you do not see the limits for how long you may stay, so to speak. If you ""feel"" qualified for anything (be it age, maturity, experience, etc.), it is only a matter of how you will ""perform.""
If it makes a difference, I have been here for over 3 years, in this forum. I am a mature adult. In my case, this was something that my father, who is in his 60s, had told me when I was a young kid, at 15, to always do the best in ""any"" situation you come across, whether you are an ""adult"" or a ""child"". I guess I've always lived by that, and I always will. This has not changed since I arrived here, which is 3+ years ago."

She has her hands in her own money (her grandparent gave her the cash to help pay for her college). However, she has not been the responsible, thoughtful girl that I wish she would have been. I think she may have made some poor choices that have caused my husband and I some worry. We do not think that she is in any danger, but, we think it would be good to have some control over what she does once she goes off to college.
We do plan to give her more money in the future, not to pay all or even most of her debts, and to let her make her choices as she wants, as long as it is not too much. Our biggest concern is making sure she gets to the point where she can take care of herself without having to depend on others. 
Would we be able to open an account and give it her as a joint account? My daughter is an adult, so I can give this account away to her, without her needing my permission. Would my mother-in-law and father- in- law see the account as ""hers"" and the control that we would retain as well? What would our bank want to know in setting this up for us so that it can be a legal contract with our names on it, such as, a power of attorney document?  We plan on having an attorney review and write this document once things are in a more stable place for my child. Thanks! I look forward to all your suggestions and opinions!

A:
(1) You don't want a bank that is going to do the right thing and close her account. If she misappropriated money, don;t use her name as an owner. Your bank needs to be very careful about this because it could be interpreted that they have liability. It's the bank's problem, your daughter has no idea what happened, the burden of proof is on them, they will close the accounts and then you could get sued. (2) The other concern would come in if she decides to leave her job and take a year off, or maybe she's in college and can't come home for a while. You won't have her income for the foreseeable future and a lot of expenses will have to come out of"

If you‘re a business owner or an entrepreneur, chances are you know that your credit file can determine your hiring decisions, your mortgage rates, and even your access to certain jobs or loan offers. That‚Äôs why protecting your identity is a priority. Unfortunately, one of the most widely used ways to gather this information may have been compromised. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is investigating a data breach at a U.S. company called ChoicePoint. According to an FTC press release, Choicepoint allegedly collected data on nearly 100 million customers from various retailers, insurance companies, hospitals, schools, government agencies, financial institutions, law enforcement and others.

Edit: I am only allowed 4 answers. So please, if there's an answer you really disagree with, make it clear! Thanks
Also, any tips in general would be very appreciated. I have already been on test-prep sites, and I know that this is a really long text, which means that my time can be better spent on practicing the material rather than wasting it on reading a paragraph or two and thinking about what I've read. Also, the text has a lot of very similar passages, in which I think I read the same paragraph twice in a row, because the context is too vague/ambiguous. Thus, it makes me very sleepy and tired. That being said: Is there a trick that can help me focus more on the important information instead of getting tired? Also: How can I make my answer shorter? The more I write, usually the more accurate I become. Can I somehow condense information or can someone help with a paraphrase of what's already there? Or, do you have any useful links to read? Thanks a ton, as always! :)

And what about other speakers? What would be the best approach for them to get the correct and best result? Would they have to use a specific verb? How do those verbs play a role in the outcome? Is it better to write an intent in general? Should one always ask for a verb in his/her own language in order to have a better context in case it is interpreted as an action? Does the verb have an effect on the interpretation? Or should the speaker use the same verb each time? For example:

I will book a train from London to Amsterdam for my kids.
  I will get a flight from New York to London for myself.  

  vs.

 I get my kid a ticket from Amsterdam to New york. Myself from new yorks to london. We both have different verbs with different meanings. But the sentence with the second sentence would imply we both use an online booking service. How should we interpret the first sentence if it could mean different things? Also: The meaning would become different. I know for sure that I am not able to book my own flights, train etc so it would sound more natural if I used for example, myself which in most cases would mean me or I

194,What Age Do My Kids Need To Be To Use Your Service?,Considering this utterance: What Age Do My Kids Need To Be To Use Your Service? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it to ask the user what their child’s age group they are? Or to say that the children should not use a given service?

I believe it‘s the latter, the former is more of a “Do they know how old they have to be?” question.
In this case you should be asking ‘how does the service help you? Do you want it for your children, your parents, or your grandparents? What are the benefits and features are you looking for in this service‚? If any? Are they clear enough. If not, what is confusing about these questions? I mean if the person is not a parent, they might just say ‚I want one for my grandparents‰. And you would just not have a clear understanding of the questions of your intent. Also, you don‟t mention your target user group, and I„d say you didn“t target very well for this question (which is why it got a negative answer). The other thing is, this is a very broad question and has several possible interpretations. So it can also be considered as a non-question, even though it is presented as one. This can be a problem since you can‛t really ask a lot of different, different question with one single question like this. It is also a good practice, to try to use multiple, more detailed questions. In this example you could have asked multiple questions like „What are your main concerns related to the elderly? ” and ‛Why do you not want older people to have this particular smartphone?.‬
The same questions should also work for other services. Like for example the answer to this ‟What device or service are they looking to get? Does it work as advertised? Have you tried it out before? How is that experience? Why is it not what you are expecting? And so on…‖. I have seen this in many questions and answers and it should always be the first thing in your mind when you write an answer. Asking questions also helps you to think about your answers, how your service will be used and how will you help the target group. Another thing that should come into mind is when asking a question, make sure the wording is clear. The answer should reflect how the question was asked (I think it"

What is the intent that best describes it?,"I think that it is pretty clear that he wants the bank to make him an account and that is it. But the question is: ""How long would it take for this person?"" Is their intent to have a full time account, a part time (say once a week) account or what. Is there a specific age to which they are looking?

My interpretation is that the person wants to know if the account is age-based and if it isn't, then he has to pay a penalty.

What do people want me to do? How to answer? Do they just want a job or do they want something else? Is this a ""what do you think I would do if ____ happened to me"" kind of question? If so: What's a reasonable expectation of what you would be thinking if you had no options? For instance, I might answer that if my husband lost his job and I had to support his family I'd be really upset and sad for awhile. I wouldn't want them to leave me alone while I was dealing with my sadness. That's what they're looking for and it's why there are a lot of ""how long?"" questions in the job market. If I knew I could work in a restaurant for the rest of my life, my answers would not be about the restaurant. So what does that mean? Well, if they ask a question that you want you to think or you are thinking about, and they don't give you an accurate answer you might ask them about it, or ask someone else who would have the answer, but you'll do that in some other way. Also the ""do a little googling"" answer will give good information. Don't just say it without a reason though... if there's any way to get an answer through a different means that will probably work better...
Another approach is to ask ""why is X something I should do?"" If the interviewer says it has nothing todo with you... ""ok"" if not, you can use the above reasoning as to why. (you can also say ""I like that"" and give your own reason for liking it or ""that doesn't answer my question"")"

I don't know about ""intent"" in law, but I am curious to know what the law would be in regard to the above question - how old does a person have to be to open an account at the bank? Does it matter if it's fraudulently attained, or just the simple lack of a sufficient account to begin with.

It is not fraud for the person to not know they're not of the correct age for opening an official bank account. Fraud would include intentionally misrepresenting their age in that regard. You might have a hard time proving fraud in the first place, however."

It is quite possible that you are using the wrong strategy to handle the utterances.
If you want to understand the problem better and have a clearer picture of your application domain, you could perform some research, or if you have some time then have your manager read the following material:

You can also check this post:  https://devcentral.f5.microsoft.co...
To address the last part of 'this utterane' specifically, I would first do some basic research about this. For example I googled the string 'Where Can i View my Pin?' and this is what I found: https//www..../view-my-pin

“I Used Ping The Ping” is an idiom. This idiolect means you got into trouble by using some feature and now some other people know that, too.

What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it asking for help to do anything? To do something to remedy the situation? A little guidance on how to phrase the question better will go a long way.

The context you use can make a difference. I've asked for similar help in situations where I'm not asking the person to try and do a specific thing to help me. For example, instead of saying:
""I need to know if you have access to the printer, so I can print out my assignment.""
I asked: ""Do you happen to have a printer laying around anywhere?""
That gives people more context to understand that I was asking if someone had access so they could print it out."

I'm sorry, but I am not sure it is right to put these two sentences together. As I have said before, we use ""that"" where ""which"" would be more appropriate. But that would suggest that when they are put together, this situation applies to both sentences.

comma
@user332357 - I understand where you are coming from, that ""they"" and ""this"" could mean that there is a more direct correlation with the two statements. However, as a native speaker, it seems to be that these statements could be put out separately and mean different things. And, in context, they could not be confused. You have an example of a sentence that says a certain pin can be blocked by the wrong number. If you replaced the ""wrong number"" in that sentence with another number, then there would not necessarily be any correlation between the number you put in the incorrect slot and the reason you couldn't move to the next level. So the sentence ""I got blocked, and I can't unblock my pin"" is different in meaning from ""When I put the same pin in as the previous level, the level moves to another place,"" since it can refer to completely unrelated situations. I hope this explains my point. Thank you. :)

+1 for the comma
The problem is not ""what would make this sentence grammatically correct"" but ""how would somebody in real life understand this?"" I don't know anyone who would put ""They"" first and then ""This"" after, if that were their first intention for that second one (and thus I think it's probably a very awkward sentence). It's only natural to me to have this order: This is something that happened, now I want to tell you about it. In this example, you can have the first sentence (""They"") without the need for a second sentence. ""That"" works the exact same here, just with ""the"" instead. The only time I would use a comma would probably be if you already said a noun"
209,"My Pin Was Blocked, How Do I Make It So I Can Use It?","Considering this utterance: My Pin Was Blocked, How Do I Make It So I Can Use It? What is the intent that best describes it?","I would answer it is probably “to make it so I can use the pin I already own.”

Now, what is it that you are doing when you make such a statement? First, you may notice that there is no action. So what are you doing? You are not using the word ‘make’ to make this action possible, right?
You probably are more likely to say ” I need help blocking my pin. ’ How does that work? This is what happens. You have a pin that can be blocked on Twitter, and you would like to know how to block your pin on twitter. This makes no sense, since there are other ways of blocking your tweet other than tweeting the phrase „My pin was blocked.
“
How about this statement‟ I want Twitter to tell me why I was banned on a particular account. Well, there„¯s nothing to do here either, but we do something when we want the action of ‟I want to receive information‚‘. In this case we are asking for information about why we got banned and the answer would be, ‚‹I don‰t have that information so please send me that. Here, this request is very much a verb that is asking to get done. But you might ask what about the other two?›‗My Pin was Bloed, how do I make that my twitter pin is blocked? ‫¬ Well I am not going to lie, the reason for this question is that maybe, just maybe I have made such an error and I don¹t know it. I do want help to find such error, though, so my response would probably be ‹¦I will take advantage of the feature that will show me if I¸m missing any of these options. My pin can¿ªt be used for what it was meant for.¾
The last two statements are just plain funny, to think about it, they are like the last statement here, ¨I just made a mistake in the first place, I‫¯‏t want it to be so. It has nothing much to with being blocked, it has to  with making the tweet"

213,How Can I Unblock A Blocked Pin Number For My Account?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Unblock A Blocked Pin Number For My Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"If we have this knowledge, we can be able to write more sentences about it that can bring more detailed meaning to the sentence. We can write a few synonyms too, in order to make the writing more comprehensive.

This process also called paraphrasing helps you to increase the quality of your work because you are using the appropriate words and you will provide the right meaning in your sentences. When you paraphrase, you must use the suitable words because there are usually a lot of words in any text and sometimes it is difficult to choose the exact words that accurately describe your thoughts. You need to arrange the words without destroying the meaning of the original sentence and creating the necessary ideas to describe what you want to say. Many people get lost in the verbiage and tend to lose the main idea of a sentence because of synonymity. It is essential for you not to use any article when you make a paraphrasal sentence, as it will lead you toward the use of incorrect words. There are a million alternative words available, so make sure that you picked the one upon which your thought rests and that it can carry your idea to your readers."
214,What Do I Do If The Bank Machine Won'T Accept My Pin Attempts Anymore?,Considering this utterance: What Do I Do If The Bank Machine Won'T Accept My Pin Attempts Anymore? What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:

It will attempt login and if it does login successfully you will have a valid session and can continue using your account normally. If the login fails on this method, at least you would know that there was an issue and you can try it again later."
215,Can You Unlock My Pin? I Think I Entered The Wrong Pin Too Many Times.,Considering this utterance: Can You Unlock My Pin? I Think I Entered The Wrong Pin Too Many Times. What is the intent that best describes it?,"What does one want the addressee to do?

For example, in the case of the sentence in question:
a.) What do you want this woman to have in mind when you asked your question? Do you wish her to remember her PIN number? Or do perhaps wish to know her password? Perhaps, to learn how to correctly unlock your PIN or to get your password reset, etc? These, of course, are all good possibilities, but you have not stated this intention.
b.) Alternatively, what would it mean to you if the woman had no idea that you were asking her this question. Could you see yourself asking this of another friend? Of course you could. If you had an answer that was helpful, it would make it worthwhile to ask such a question, regardless of your intended answer. What would have made it worth while to this friend for you to answer the question of whether she could unlock the PIN? To know? Would that make you ask that question if she had a PIN that she was trying to unlock but was having difficulty? And of what use would that knowledge be to her? If indeed she didn't have a password for her pin, and needed your help? It doesn't matter what you think you may or may not know in order to make a decision, this will be a different set of facts than what the person who has the pin wants. For what will you make an effort? Will you spend time trying and if not succeed? So, if indeed the man has a particular need to find your pin and you can help him or her by unlocking the pad, would you? This man may want to call a friend and tell them where he left his pin. This may be what he intended to convey or it may mean something entirely different, or perhaps he wants you (the friend you called) to help in another way. I have seen this happen before. In the example above you, as well as the friend may have your intention, yet when it is communicated your friend doesn’t have that in his or hers mind. The friend just wanted the information that the original question asked of him. Perhaps you did not intend to tell the other person how you unlocked his/her pad? But by answering this way, you opened a new door for him/ her, for yourself. It was an unexpected answer, the best possible"
216,How Do I Deal With A Blocked Pin?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Deal With A Blocked Pin? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Does it have a positive outcome or a negative outcome?

What are the consequences that a person needs to deal with? What will this person have to do to get around the problems of blocked pins? If you think of a situation when you experienced one blocked pin, do you know what you had to say or do in order to change this situation? Do you remember? I do.
The way I remember it all was like this: There was a guy. He had a girlfriend. I want her back. The guy was sad and he thought how to remove the pain of his heart. So he did. This is what he decided to use:
“If you don’t love me for who I am then you shouldn”t have me.‏
It sounds like a nice phrase but the truth is this phrase has a bad effect. In fact it causes many troubles in the life of this guy as I will talk about it in this part. Here I have two examples for you: Example number 1 and example number 2. Now you can do what I did, you decide what the guy said and what his intentions were with the phrase. You do it alone as the next part is for two of us. Two of our minds. We will see why. Example: Let‘s say that you find the word love in his sentence. Then, he wants to love you for your beauty, for example. How can you love him if he is so ugly that nobody would love? It is easy to judge a book by its cover. But you should not judge by your looks the heart of another person. If your heart hurts because you see that the love is not reciprocated, that would mean that is a broken heart, not a blocked one. Blocking pins is different. Let me tell you why: Blame your thoughts for blocking a pin. Your thoughts can either block a love or an emotion of it. For example: If the boy feels like you„re not good enough for him and you are too good to be with him. As he feels that there was another guy who was better than himself. It makes him believe that it is your fault that he does not have the chance to find true love. Therefore, the pin is blocked. To help you with your broken hearts, I wrote a part in “How do I deal...

218,Can I Unblock My Card Using The App?,Considering this utterance: Can I Unblock My Card Using The App? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Can I unblock my card using the app? I want to know the best way to do it. I already have the code to un-block. But I just want it to be easier for my customers. So far they are not very smart when it comes to online banking. They always want a human to walk through the steps.
I have already tried it with just sending the card code and the pin to the server and it works. The problem is that I need the user to enter their card number and pin. Also, I don't want them typing anything in because they have to type it in on their phone. It's a big pain. Can't I get it without using my own server to handle the requests? Thanks!
UPDATE: I have a website that is already live. When I try it I use the website instead of the android app to send requests to my website. If you are talking about an app you need to add the api of your website in the manifest file. To make it easy you can use my example and just change the url and you will get a request. This works if you have an already set up server. You just need an api so that it can go to that url. Then use a normal ajax request to call the end point."
219,I'V Exhausted All The Of Times I Can Try My Pin,Considering this utterance: I'V Exhausted All The Of Times I Can Try My Pin What is the intent that best describes it?,"The speaker is saying ""I've tried every possible way to get this task done, but this is what I've got."" Or,
They're saying, ""There's been no luck at this point, so I'll try something else.""
It sounds like ""It's over!""
But it's probably more of an ""Oh well"" or ""That's too bad."" It can sound like disappointment or despair as well. (This doesn't mean you're discouraged or depressed though. You're simply stating the case as it is, no judgment.)
This would describe how you felt after the last two times you tried to make an impact. So it doesn’s mean that “I want to quit”.
Here's the sentence:
“There s been no luck at this point, so I ‚ll‖try›something„else‡‰‹.  ‌ ‍‛‘‏

220,How Can I Unlock My Pin From Too Many Tries?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Unlock My Pin From Too Many Tries? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What do you understand the person is saying or meaning by this?

1.
I need a help unlocking my pin number from too many tries. Can you help me? (Intent: request for help.)
2. I’m going to unlock my PIN from so many incorrect attempts from now on (Not sure of the best way to interpret. Is the speaker talking about a change in behavior, or a new requirement.)?"
221,Help! I Forgot My Pin And Have Been Locked Out Of Using My Card.,Considering this utterance: Help! I Forgot My Pin And Have Been Locked Out Of Using My Card. What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:
There are three main kinds of intents and four categories of action verbs, and most of the action words fall into these three categories. The verbs are: to do something, to act out something and to react to something.
To act is to perform an act, do, or cause some action. Examples include: ""to get up"" or ""I'll act on this"". To do implies the performing of an action, but also implies a degree of control on one's own part. For instance, if I act (i.e. I put on my hat and shoes) without really doing so (e., my shoes don't actually get put onto my feet), then I've acted out but not really done. You can act without doing something (like the way you sit or stand or move your arm), but doing implies an element of intention. ""How will you act with them?""  ""She will act as if it were true."" You may react or respond by doing things without intending to, so ""will she respond in kind?"".
You can use these verbs to describe an emotional context, for example ""she is reacting"". The context is usually emotional, though, rather than physical. If I were to say ""help"", what I'm really trying to express might be ""how can I make some emotional connection with you""? The ""want"", ""need"" and ""hope"" verbs can also be used to communicate emotion. 
Hope is a form of anticipation, desire or expectation that something will occur. It is very different from the idea of ""hoping for a better tomorrow"". Hope is similar to expectation in that they both involve an idea that is positive, not negative. Hoping is often thought of as a desire, such as ""he hopes for the best outcome"". This is not always the case, as when ""We hope for your success"" may mean that you are actually disappointed in another's success. A desire that has become habituated or that we no longer really care much about can be thought as being ""wishy-washy"". For example, ""do you want to go shopping?"" is quite different to ""should you go out and buy groceries?"". This difference is because my response now means nothing more than, I want you to choose the food we will eat tomorrow or the next day, depending on whose choice"
222,"My Account Is Blocked, How Do I Log In Now","Considering this utterance: My Account Is Blocked, How Do I Log In Now What is the intent that best describes it?","If the answer is ""to log in"", then the second example is a correct one. However, the same answer can be a bit ambiguous depending on the context.

My Account is BlocKed:
  This may mean that my account has been blocked due to repeated
fraudulent activity, or that it cannot be accessed because something
is blocking it. The former may refer to an individual user account,
the latter may apply to a group of users with the Account Administrator
role, such as a corporate site."
223,Why Did I Get Blocked?,Considering this utterance: Why Did I Get Blocked? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The author seems to be expressing a kind of frustration, or even anger.

If you think about it, the meaning is obvious: ""Why did I get blocked?"". The answer? ""Because the blockers blocked me"".
That is, of course, not a complete sentence. But it conveys what the author wanted to express. So let's see how we can do this in English. 
As with the first sentence example, we have to decide which structure to use. We could use an ""if"" clause to create something like this:
""You got blocked because the blockers blocked you"".   [It would be a conditional sentence.]
Or we could do a little bit of ""sub-text"" and use a ""because"" construction with something to fill the blank. For example we might say:  ""You became the victim of a block attack"". That would mean ""the blockers, using an attack against you, made you the object of some kind"". We might also say ""you became a target of an online attack because you are not blocking them"". Again, it is not the exact same thing being said, but I think it gets the idea across."
224,Are You Able To Unblock My Pin?,Considering this utterance: Are You Able To Unblock My Pin? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The best guess is:

The speaker is requesting something of me. However, the way he worded it gives me the idea that either he is asking if he can get in or if I am able to block his pin.
I am not going to attempt to guess based on the words alone, because of the difference in how each of them are constructed. You are going have to ask yourself: what is my first reaction to this person and this words?
If you are not sure of how to phrase that question, ask friends, family members, or a professional."
225,Can You Assist Me With Unblocking My Pin? I Put It In Wrong Too Many Times.,Considering this utterance: Can You Assist Me With Unblocking My Pin? I Put It In Wrong Too Many Times.

But this book has a different perspective that most of the books that I have read. And, as a result, I will give my opinion based on personal experience. Hopefully, this will bring new ideas for each of us. There is a wealth of knowledge in this. I recommend it highly:
The Science of Enlightenment by Paramahansa Yogananda."
226,I Entered The Wrong Pin Too Many Times And Now I Am Blocked.  Help Me Unblock!,Considering this utterance: I Entered The Wrong Pin Too Many Times And Now I Am Blocked.  Help Me Unblock! What is the intent that best describes it?,"I would say: ""I entered the wrong pin too many times and now I am blocked"" (it's a metaphor for ""too many time I tried something and failed"")

A:
It's an example of elliptical syntax with an adverbial: 
""I Entered the Wrong PIN Too many Times"".
An example: The dog ate my homework. I'm too angry to go to work."
227,"My Pins Seems To Be Blocked, Can You Unblock It Please","Considering this utterance: My Pins Seems To Be Blocked, Can You Unblock It Please What is the intent that best describes it?","Is this an expression of annoyance? Or is it more passive-aggressive? How do you know?

Here’s another common example: I‘ve been in this same city for years, and I always seem to get my mail mixed up at the same post office. Could it be that your mail has arrived in a different box since your last visit. Or maybe, it”s a matter of you having your name on the wrong envelope and it gets delivered to the old place. How sure are you? What might be possible reasons for the behavior of this person? Can you be more objective here.
The first two of the examples, “My Pinks is blocked,“ and ”My Pinseems to be Bloked, can you Unbloke‰ it plese, could be seen as a passive aggressive statement. The first sentence could easily be a sarcastic expression that says ‘What‟s wrong, are your Pinos blocked or something??‚
In a second example ‚ÄúI„ve Been In this Same City‍ÑÆ‡µ‹‬›Y ,I always Seem to Get my Mail Mixed Up at this Post Office‪ÔÇØ, Could. It „´Be That your Mail Has Arrived in different Box since you Last Visited, or it ’´Could Be that you have Your Name On the Wrong envelope And it Gets Delivered to your Old Place.,´´
If the first person is irritated or passive hostile it shows in the tone he says, in an aggressive or hostile way, his/her voice is sharp, abrupt and harsh. In the second person, we are more certain of what is happening or what he is thinking because we speak directly to an †object that we believe is more likely to understand us, because it is an entity, not a person. This is a more subtle form of passive or aggressive, but still the person has his or her own reasons behind the words that he uses and the way that they express his opinion. I hope this helps explain why you use certain words for a reason, even though that reason may be subconscious. Thanks for your question. Please let me know how you feel about all of these examples. ‪‌"
228,Can You Unblock My Pin After Too Many Wrong Pin Attempts?,Considering this utterance: Can You Unblock My Pin After Too Many Wrong Pin Attempts? What is the intent that best describes it?,"(choose just one)
1: To help the user

2: No intent
3: I do not understand the context.
4: It is not clear what is being said
5: There was no intent. This sentence should be removed. It has no use.  
It looks like it's 3. But why is there no context? And where is it written what to do with wrong pin attempts, or even any pins?
My intuition is telling me it is 2. Can you help me by confirming and explaining how to understand this sentence?  Thank you for your time and effort, and sorry if it has been asked before. I searched for an explanation but did not get anything. :)
This is an excerpt of an automated SMS service, so it may be different for a human. Thankyou for reading. (I'm trying to learn)  :-)
P.S: If there's a better tag for this question - please feel free to edit it. The current one doesn't seem to fit. Thanks!
Edit:
For context and more information, here are the rest of the sentences after the one in question (this comes after a list of other questions).
- Can I change my password? [Yes]
(Yes, you can change your PIN).  <-- This is what I'm confused about. Why is this in there? Do they mean a PIN that is already correct, not a new PIN? Is there any context with this line? I would expect a confirmation of what was said above the 'No' text. Is my understanding correct? Thank You for any input. Again, I am trying hard to get to the root of this. There isn't a tag, but perhaps it can be added. So it doesn' fit any existing one? Or it could be a combination of many tags? If it helps I can edit in the part that makes all of it fit a specific tag. Not sure what you'd want to call it though.

A:
In your case, if you are sure you have a legitimate reason or need to use that user's account, I would suggest you contact them to explain what is happening.  It's possible that the person is using an old PIN that is no longer valid."
231,Can I Reactivate My Pin?,Considering this utterance: Can I Reactivate My Pin? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Can I reactivate my PIN? – is a question asked by the end user when the device has been lost and they want to know if there is any way for them to reactivation the lost device.
In this situation, the answer is that the user must ask the operator of the service center. It does not have a way to be reactivated. Also, it will be a problem for the operators because the PINs must be sent by a secure channel. For that reason, when you have lost your pin (the user can be any) you will not be able to recover it without the help of a third party (usually an online service for example).
The answer given by your service provider is not the way that it is supposed to work. When it does the job is usually by sending a text, email, push or call to the phone. In both cases, we are talking about a method to send information to another entity. However, in the case of an PIN, a pin is never a number or a phone number. PIN is only a password (if it were not for this the pin would be considered a security feature and not a simple password)."
232,How Do I Reset My Pin?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Reset My Pin? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What do you hope the learner will do? What do I want to have happen? How would the speaker want me to react? Is there something I do not want the person to do but might inadvertently? This is often the case in a telephone call, especially in an urgent situation. This learener is about to reset his pin so that he can access his bank account.
My best guess based on the text as is, is that there is some information being shared which the user has forgotten. He will now be required to ""re-enter"" his username and password which he has just successfully been given. The reason he asks this question is because he does not understand what he needs to enter into his device to accomplish the reset. 
I would also say that it is a very specific intent. It is not about general knowledge which someone might have about bank accounts. However in general the verb means ""to make something go away"". The example I gave is something the listener is already aware of, but is now ""making someone's job"" easier. In general, a common phrasal verb (that is an idiomatic expression that is common or common sense) means something similar. So, in this case there are two choices:
1) ""How do i make my pin go back to my account?""
This is what I would guess. Based on this answer I might assume that the device has been locked and the password has not been reset and that now a different password is being given to the phone user. I think this is likely the most accurate assumption based off of this text alone. If I ask a question on a forum about how to change a password or make a login ID to a phone number, someone would likely respond with something along the lines ""how do we change the number on your account"".
2) How do ""I make"" reset my PIN?"
233,Can I Unblock My Pin?,Considering this utterance: Can I Unblock My Pin? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What if the subject changes from you to other people?

The first one is an example of an assertion, and the second one of a request.
In the first example we are describing an action, ""to unblock a pin"". We can think that someone is blocking the ""pin"" so we want to do something that allows the person to see the pin. 
However in the example ""Can I unblck my pin?"" you can't describe that you want the owner to be able to view the object, you are just asking the question ""If I can un-block my own pin, will it be public or private?""
There is also the fact that the word 'blocked' can have another connotation. When you ask, for example, can I access my email or can you access your email, it is understood that, if we can, we will be allowed to, so in this case your use of it will make a different use out of the sentence."
234,How Do I Unblock My Pin?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Unblock My Pin? What is the intent that best describes it?,"A person might ask this question because they want to unblock their PIN without having to ask their bank, their mobile phone contract provider and their wireless service. This is an attempt to remove the obstacle that is preventing someone from accessing something and is a form of control. In a way it can be considered as self preservation because by unblocking their account, the person will be able to continue to use the services they have purchased, but they might also be attempting to avoid getting a phone bill and having it be sent to a different address.

This utterence: Do You Need Your Car Insurance? is asking if you will need your car insurance when your are not driving a vehicle. The context of this sentence would be when someone is planning for future trips or when planning to go on vacation and not use their vehicle for some time. It is important that you are covered under an insurance policy while you do not have your vehicle registered or licensed, because you should be responsible for your own insurance. By not registering the vehicle or by not paying the insurance it could cost someone else's life. Therefore, you might want an umbrella policy to add this to your insurance coverage. When you have an auto policy, your insurer will cover you and your family while your not operating any vehicle and if this is what you want, there are insurance companies that offer this type of coverage called Auto Uninsured Motorist (UIM) coverage as part of your auto insurance contract. UIM will provide you with coverage for damage that may be caused to you, if someone hits you while they are operating an uninsured vehicle, or if the other parties vehicle is insured, they won't have to take responsibility for the damages that are caused. You might consider having an Auto Policy with UMA if:
• You do plan on driving in the future. If you currently do have a UCA on your policy. There are some states that if your current Uca is in effect, will not allow you to make a claim under a new policy that has a UA (Uninsured and underinsured motorist) provision. However, in those states a simple transfer of the Uua to the new contract might be sufficient. To make sure that the law of those jurisdictions is correct, check into the policy provisions for this. (See State Farm: Uncomp, Auto Insurance Law for further information on this.)

235,"My Card'S Frozen, What Can I Do?","Considering this utterance: My Card'S Frozen, What Can I Do? What is the intent that best describes it?","I believe the speaker is trying to make the other person understand that he/she/they have a broken freezer and needs help, so the best way to fix that issue is just as if the freezer was frozen, which is frozen.
If we add the word 'frozen' to the sentence, how can we express in one simple sentence the same idea the original speaker intends to convey?

My freezer's frozen/froze over, what can I do? 
I don't know. My card's broken, can you help me? or
It stopped working. I don’t know how I will pay you.   My phone's
faulted/caught/went out, and I can't do anything. (In this case, I think  “It”
is trying  to  mean the phone).
We can add other words to express the meaning more specifically as:

He is asking: “How can I unlock the pin?”
It is a question of ‘How to' (in an affirmative sense).
This question is asked to an expert. This is not an ’I need information‘

And so on. The answers would then follow from the context."

B - He wants to have dinner with his family. 
Can you please assist with this question?   My attempt would be to use A, since it has the idea of being outside and is not restricted to any one person or place. But I can't quite understand it. I would think he would want his/her family or friends to unblock it, thus the B. Can B be the reason behind the question if A is incorrect? Or can it be used as a standalone question. In this case, would it make sense to replace B with their family/friends? If not, I'm not sure where to look to find the best way to express it and would greatly appreciate your help. Thank you!  Also, is there a similar sentence that I could use in order to make the answer clear? I have the following options to choose from:
Since My House Was Stolen, Help My Family Get The Insurance Claim. - This one feels like a bit of an abuse to my mind, but that is how I am interpreting it - the person is asking for help so that they can get insurance money for their stolen house. This is probably the option I should go for, because it would make more sense. However, it still leaves the possibility of it being a bad idea, so I might want a second option. Would the sentence below make it clear enough to the listener of the fact that the speaker is in fact asking them for assistance to get the money? (Please note that this is my interpretation for this sentence)  Since I Losing All My Stuff, Could You Bring It To My Work? -  This seems like another abuse, again because the main intention of this person wants help in the first place, and not to bring his stuff to work. Perhaps if they could just bring the insurance information, that would help the situation? It would only seem appropriate since he has no intention to actually go pick it up. Thanks!
Lastly, do you know of any other similar questions that can be asked in this context? As a whole, this seems to be a very common way of asking people to pass something on to another person.

239,Where Can I Get My Pin Unblocked?,Considering this utterance: Where Can I Get My Pin Unblocked? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The intent of this statement is to ask about the location of Pin. The location is an object or an action. In this sample sentence the verb get must have the object.

In my opinion, the first thing we should know is ""What is a verb?"" A verb is always the action word in verb phrases. ""To write"", ""to speak"", and ""I eat"" are verbs. Verb phrases are made up of a subject and a main verb, and the main verbs are called the root verbs of the sentences. We will go through a few different verbs to see how they change. If you have learned English verbs in an academic way, you might find what we are saying here very confusing and you should learn more basic grammar before going on. But for those of you, like me, who have been using English for all of your life, we will start learning basic structures of sentences and phrases with verb learning. Let's start now. First, how does the subject fit with the sentence. When the Subject has to do ""what"" to the other words in the Sentence, it is called a complemented verb. Take a good look at this sentence: I have read a book today
I have done something, which means I did something to make something happen. This is just like the I-to-do. So we have a similar structure between the English I in I do it and I to-read. I can see now that I should be learning more verb structures now since I will see many other verb patterns similar to this soon. It is better to learn this kind of simple grammar first to get a deeper understanding before learning about more complex structures. For example, if we learn about nouns first, then we can learn a lot of verb rules and structures without having to worry about learning the complex ones. Once you understand simple verb structure rules, such as this one, your English writing will improve. Now that we know verbs, let's look into the simple structure of ""verb"". A VERB has a structure just as follows: subject + main or complemeneted verb + object + preposition. That is, a VERb is made of three parts: (S, P, V).
S=subject
P=preposition or particle
V=verb root. Note that the Verb Root is usually a regular Verb, although there are exceptions. You will learn"
240,Are Contactless Payments Enabled On My New Card?,Considering this utterance: Are Contactless Payments Enabled On My New Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This is a question that has occurred to many users over the last few years. As the adoption of mobile and Internet payment systems has become more common, consumers have started becoming more aware of their credit card usage, and, of course, as a result, card brands have had to develop more user-friendly technologies and processes to help guide and educate the general population.
As part of that initiative, we have now seen the rise of technologies such as Near Field Communication (NFC)-enabled cards that have given consumers the ability to use mobile phones instead of using regular credit cards. With the use of these types of cards, you no longer have to manually enter your card details into a point of sale system. Instead, when you present your mobile phone to the POS system it automatically detects the presence of a contactless card and will be automatically authenticated and validated. It's really quite convenient, but there are a couple of things that you may not know about this technology. Here are three things you should know if you're considering a new or updated contact or near field communication card. 1. The Card is not NFC Enabled. Although this new generation of credit and debit cards is NFC-enabled, the contact points on the card still require the magnetic strip on your credit or debit card to have an NFC chip as well, allowing the two points to be in contact when your magnetic stripe is read. So you can say that your contact credit/debit card is, in reality, an enhanced magnetic swipe card (EMSC).
2. You Don't Have to Go to Stores with NFC Payments. Some card issuers and merchants have begun to enable this functionality so that customers can use their contact debit/credit cards in stores and restaurants, eliminating the need for you to carry around two different kinds of plastic cards on one card holder. In most cases you will see this on new card technology being advertised as ""contactless"" or ""tap and go"" and some cards may even have the NFC logo on them (see picture below). While this type of NFC technology is certainly a convenience for consumers (no more carrying two plastic/metallic cards), it should not be mistaken for being NFC enabled in the true sense of the word.3. Even with these advances in technology, your traditional magnetic payment card will remain an important part to your financial experience. When you use your EMV smart card, make sure you remember that"
241,My Contanctless Has Stopped Working,Considering this utterance: My Contanctless Has Stopped Working What is the intent that best describes it?,"This is what is commonly referred to as a ""declarative sentence""

The person making the uttering is describing a true (not false) fact.
""My Contactless Card Has Stopped Working"" does not have an ""I"" or an action verb or any other verb that suggests an intention of doing something. 
In this situation, this person is not saying it, or intending to do anything. It is simply a description of a fact, and a statement of fact and not an I-statement or a V-Statement. If someone wanted to use the pronoun ""It"" in place of the Subject of these sentences, they would simply type, ""The phone is broken"", or in this instance,""My Contacless card stopped working"" ""the phone stopped ringing.""
There is nothing in the sentence structure or grammar that indicates an intent to act. There is no intention, nor is there any suggestion that the speaker is attempting to convey anything else other than an accurate description that describes a reality. This person has not taken any action, does NOT have the intention to call the phone company, in any way, shape, manner or form. The person simply made a factual statement, describing the fact that their contract is terminated, without making any attempt to contact any service."

This is an incredibly helpful discussion to me. Thanks for writing it up! I'll have to check that link and add it to my ""To-do"" list. I can't remember the last time when I needed the DMV for anything, but this was very helpful nonetheless.
And you are correct, there are so many of these threads where there is no real answer or there's a very weak or misleading one. It would be great if the people who can help could at least give some feedback about how they are being helped - that's the only way you can improve the quality or quantity of information on the wiki. That way it can be more useful to everyone, not just to those who stumble upon it. The only place this has started is in the user pages and the pages linked to that. Perhaps, in an ideal world, everyone can provide some sort of feedback or comments on how their experiences have been. You can also ask questions that you may have or things that are confusing you, on a separate page and then we can refer those users to the right sections of this wiki and maybe help answer their specific question in a more efficient way. Maybe, at the least, it would create a place where people would feel a little less isolated and alone in their problems. For example, people might get the impression that the contact-less cards that they get in stores work everywhere all the time, so people aren't going to go into a store and ask, ""Hey, is this place the same as the one where I just got a card from?"" Or perhaps they just want to see ""a"" place, or they want something more specific. But if they know, say,"

A:
(a)(b)(c)?  
For (C), I don't have any problem thinking of a phone/contact reader as a form of card ""reader"" in this setting.
It seems that you want to distinguish the two questions:  How to use the card/mobile reader (with contact) to make the wallet work as well as it can (and the phone)? versus  how to get (or use) the built-in ""Contactless"" feature of the reader.  To be very clear, these are not mutually exclusive. You can have both."

@Bree – Yes, I did notice that. It seems as if contact is a different protocol than contact free (contactless), and that the bus has a limit for the amount of transactions they allow to execute. (If you're looking at a list that allows you to see the total amount for each day, the limit seems to start when it's just about over 50%. I'm assuming that's the maximum amount you can spend with one of their cards.) It may make sense to switch to their website, or contact the customer service line at (503) 888-1414 if you prefer. As far as why it happened at all, that can be tough to say. Perhaps you were able to load your card, but maybe they got a message to decline? It's a guess. The good news is that it won't always happen (you'll get an error message if it is declined), the bad news (again) is it might happen from time to time!
You can still try to talk to them about your experience, if that helps. Good luck! :-)

246,I'Ve Been Unable To Pay Contactless With My Card For Over A Week Now. Is There A Way To Fix This Issue?,Considering this utterance: I'Ve Been Unable To Pay Contactless With My Card For Over A Week Now. Is There A Way To Fix This Issue? What is the intent that best describes it?,"How can it be used in a sentence? What does it mean?

1.
This is an utterances that expresses a person's inability to pay for something. It's a negative statement. You are unable to do something or unable pay a bill. In your example, you have been unable for over a week. To pay can mean:
To do work (for someone)
Do business
Pay for
Give something to
Receive money
Sell something
Ask for a donation
Buy something from someone
2. This is a very common and popular saying and it's often used to complain and complain about something you don't like. The word I is used here to show that the speaker is complaining or speaking negatively about this situation. When using I you may use: ""I didn't have enough money to go to the movie."", "" I'm unable, I don’t have a way of paying."", or ""Can I get paid in cash please?""
3. I have unable is often confused with I can't. For example: Can I use the restroom? You can use it, but you need to be considerate and ask before you use. If you see someone in the bathroom or stall, would you ask if they‘re OK, before using? If so, then you can say, "" Can you please use your restroom right now?"" ""Is everything ok?"".
4. We may say the following in this context: “I've been out of work for 2 weeks. No one will hire a teacher like me.”
5. There could be several possible meanings. Here are some: You say it in order to express that you‚Äôve been able to make a payment using this card. However, it is unclear as to whether this is still true or the card was just not recognized. So you might ask: Are you still able? It is also possible that they don'Æt want to give you access to it. That' Æs another possibility. They are unsure when this will be fixed. Lastly, a user might say that it'‰Ås been a while since they've used their card, and that could mean many different things.

This is a statement of fact. The statement is accurate and reliable. To a listener who has heard other statements and is familiar with the way contactless payment works, the message would not convey any information about why the contactlessly-activated credit/debit card is not working. It would be more likely to convey an opinion. 
The statement conveys that the credit card was issued in conjunction with a promotion, and that this is why it is being used to make an in-person transaction, in the manner that it was intended. However, there is no guarantee that every person who receives the statement has received this promotion with this particular card. If they had, they would have been given information that would enable them to verify the accuracy of the information being conveyed. In any case, this statement would still be accurate."

Note: I will use the tag ""intent"" to refer only to the way the utterances are used, in the context of solving problems. There is a very similar tag, ""purpose"", but the purpose of an utter could vary from one problem to another.

A:

My question is: what is wrong, what can I do to fix the problem, and can you provide me with an answer to that question?""

Today I went to the shops, bought a few things and when leaving the cash register said:
""I Could Not Use The Contactful Card ThisMorning, it WasN't AcceptedInIt""
Was the statement, ""It was not accepted"" intended to express that he could not use his new card because it was rejected by the card payment system? I was wondering as to his intent, if he was expressing the impossibility of using a specific form of payment because of the circumstances in which it would have been used, or because the transaction was denied. Was I misinterpreting his statement? And, what was the best way to interpret it in this case? Thank you."
252,Contactless Isn'T Working For Me,Considering this utterance: Contactless Isn'T Working For Me What is the intent that best describes it?,"The best answer is: I don't like this idea. The reason it was chosen isn't because it contains the most words. It is because the speaker doesn't accept the premise of the question.

The following utterances have the best chance of answering the original question:
I hate this new way of shopping. I like the old one better.This new system is too confusing. How is anyone going to keep track of all this?
This system isn’t working. Contact has always been a part of my life.I‘m really not interested in this. Do you want to be my friend? This doesn‚Äôt make sense."
253,Why Wouldn'T The Contactless Payment Work When I Tried To Pay At The Bus Today?,Considering this utterance: Why Wouldn'T The Contactless Payment Work When I Tried To Pay At The Bus Today? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Why would this work, or work? What would not work about this speech?

This utterances tells more than one story. If you read this as a story, which is what I think this is, you would have to interpret what this statement means in context with previous utterations by this person, and the situation that brought them to that point in time.
A better way to ask these questions is to read it as the question, Why wouldn’t the contactless payment work when I tried to use it today? or why didn‘t it work the way I expected? I can“t tell you why it didn't work. In fact it could be anything. There are many other reasons that it might not have worked, even if I didn""t use a card. The most obvious reason that I know of is that the bus drivers decided to not accept cards that day and there wasn't a line for me to pay with cash or with a contact payment card at the time that bus came, for example. Other possibilities include that they were busy and didn' t notice me, didn t have cash on me or that there weren""T any available buses going where I needed to go at that time of the day. I also know a few other possible reasons as well. As a customer, this doesn't make paying at a store on my way home from the store a bad idea or even a less convenient one, but I do see a lot of problems in making it easier for people to make contact payments."
254,How Do I Check My Security Settings To Allow Contactless Pay?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Check My Security Settings To Allow Contactless Pay? What is the intent that best describes it?,"If you're like me, you might have some strong guesses.

Let's say the answer is ""I want to check whether an application has been written to be able to communicate securely with card readers."" This is probably the correct answer; but not all the information in the sentence will be useful. Let's try to understand this sentence from a more abstract perspective. For this purpose we first need to examine the two parts of the utterances more closely. In what order are they said?
In that case, the first part is an exclamation, which we can describe as ""an interrogative"". We can think of this as a request, although we might also think about it as an expression of surprise, if we don't agree with the result of some investigation. Here is how we would describe the part of that uttering as:
""How do I check the security settings to allow contactless pay?""
The part that is not in bold represents the questions that we want an answer to, and the italicized parts make the statement. Now we are starting to analyze the parts more carefully, one by one: (1) ""How"" (which is really ""how""), and (2) the question itself, ""do I allow"". The question can be answered with: ""yes"", ""no"", or ""don't know"".  
(3) We have now reached the subject: the ""to allow"", which is described here as the action of ""contactless"" or as allowing communication. (4) Finally we have arrived at the actual question, that asks ""Do I?"" which can either be yes as in ""To allow?"", or no as it says: Do not allow.  So, in general, there are five answer classes, as shown below (you can also refer to the original question as if it is being asked as one word ""Check my contactlessness settings"");
How:  Yes/ No/ Don't Know -> Yes -> Do ->
Yes  -> To allow -> Contact  reader
So the next thing we need is to find out what kind of security setting needs to ""allow"" this contact reader to do what it does. This depends on the application that you are talking to; so we now need some information, but we cannot simply ask ""What are your contact settings like?"" and we will not be satisfied by a yes or"
255,What Can I Do If Contactless Doesn'T Work?,Considering this utterance: What Can I Do If Contactless Doesn'T Work? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I think the answer is ""What can you do, if contactless doesn't work?"" because the contact point is missing.
Also, ""When contactpoint fails"" sounds like contact is failing, so the title should not be ""This Contactpoint is no good"" as that implies it's a problem with the card/terminal and it is just the terminal that's no working."
256,Fix My Contactless,Considering this utterance: Fix My Contactless What is the intent that best describes it?,"I'll start writing it out in my head: ""Fix my contactless card.""

Now the utterances:
FixMyContactless: I need to fix my credit card.
MyCreditCard: Need to check my card balance. No, I know what it is, just checking to make sure the correct one has been loaded. I'm not going to spend a cent until I can verify that it's there and hasn't been stolen. Not that I'd know the difference if it had been. But I have insurance, so it would be a problem if I did anyway. (This uttering is more likely in the ""checking"" scenario, but that's a minor detail.)
What's going on in here: First of all I should tell you that there's no verb, no action, only a noun. It's just a phrase that can be used for a number of things. The fact is that ""I need"" and ""check"" are interchangeable, and you don't need the verb at all in this case. You could, at a stretch, consider ""Check My Credit Card, FixMe"" as a single verb. Or you could consider it a ""noun phrase"" with the prepositional phrase ""for"". ""fixmycontactless"" could be interpreted as saying I will get some help ""getting fixed"".
But let's get back to the question: Why is ""My Credit"" in FixMyCard, not FixContact? 
Well, here's why: it has nothing to do with intent. And that, dear reader, is what matters. When I say FixCard I don,t actually mean it. That's not the issue.  What I mean is if FixCredit, that makes sense. If you want to ""get fixed"" you need something to get fixed. ""Get fixed with your credit"" is not really a thing, it just makes common sense if you have a credit account with a particular bank. So it makes perfect sense for that phrase to show up in a list of what is needed with regard to your ""credit"". But ""contact card"" does not make sense, even if there is a contact card account. Fixmycredit is fine, as is Fixcontact, because both of these things have to be fixed, they are both nouns. They are not ""intents"", they can refer to anything, you will be fine. There's an"
257,How Can I Make My Contactless Work For The Metro?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Make My Contactless Work For The Metro? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it about a contactless payment card and a payment terminal or is it a call of action on behalf of the payment technology provider to make a new payment channel for consumers?

If I was to describe the same utterances in terms of communication, they would be:
I am a consumer and I am shopping for a phone.
How can I make the store payment easy for me. (the payment will go to store).
You will get a reward for shopping with the mobile wallet. I want the offer in my mobile phone, not a paper voucher. 
Why can't we do that? It would save paper and time, right?"
258,My Contactless Is Not Working,Considering this utterance: My Contactless Is Not Working What is the intent that best describes it?,"Does the speaker want to express that their contactless cards (such as Visa, American Express, Mastercard, etc) are not working properly, or that they have no cards? Or maybe they want us to know that the card was not charged? If they had charged their card, this would be less common. Is it the same in American English?

If there isn't a common answer, what should we do then? Do we have one standard response for all contact-less-card-related utterances? In my opinion, I think the best answer is contact the contact centre. If their service centre can't fix it, they'd surely tell you to contact your bank.
You can also find information here."
259,Can You Help My Fix My Contactless?,Considering this utterance: Can You Help My Fix My Contactless? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I am having a problem with a contactless card reader that I purchased at the store (it is an Apple Pay/iTunes gift card). I have tried many things to get it to work properly, but I haven't been able to fix it so I can use it at stores. If someone knows what the issue is, I would appreciate it. Thank you.

A:
""Can you help my fix my contact less?""
To me that is a request to the listener or reader to help me fix whatever is happening with my card. It could be that the reader has a software error on the card but the question is framed as if it is something outside the readers responsibility, i.e. it has something to do with the users card rather than the system."
260,For Some Reason My Contactless Won'T Work For Me.,Considering this utterance: For Some Reason My Contactless Won'T Work For Me. What is the intent that best describes it?,"What are its implications for you and/or the person you're speaking to?

A:
I'm going to go with an implication that they didn't know it was contactless, not that it wasn't contact, because they don't really know much about it at all. 
The implications are two things. First, you can tell them you have to do something with your wallet, and when they do it, there will be a fee. Second, it's not working correctly, so you must not have it set up correctly. So they think they know what it is, but they may not, or may only have heard that there are people who get charged for it.
So in short, the implication is that you want to get the payment, for whatever reason, from a machine that doesn't have any other purpose."

How Can I Prevent This In The Future?","Considering this utterance: When I Tried To Pay For My Bus Ride, The Contactless Payment Wouldn'T Work. How Can I Prevent This In The Future? What is the intent that best describes it?","I tried to pay for my bus ride but the payment didn't work. I was able to complete my purchase successfully.

A:
[I'm assuming that you mean, ""What's the best way I can prevent this situation in the future?"" rather than simply ""How can I prevent it?""]
I think the answer to that question is ""I recommend using a different payment method"" (for example, a credit card) and to keep the contactless payment device in a secure part of the wallet, such as the outside of your wallet in your pocket or purse in which you've stored it. That's because the point of contactlessness is to eliminate the need to have a wallet with you. You can keep your credit cards in it for easy access while still carrying around your contact-based card and the pass (if you use that), but it's less convenient to use them together. If something happens to your card reader or the card you are trying to make the purchase with is compromised, you'll be out the money, plus you could lose the information from the compromised card."
263,The Nfc Payment Wouldn'T Work On The Bus Today. Help?,Considering this utterance: The Nfc Payment Wouldn'T Work On The Bus Today. Help? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it a statement of fact, of prediction, and more? In this article, we'll see how to answer this question by examining the way in which you express it in your own language, or in other words, your grammar.

Grammar is a tool that allows to get into the heart of the matter. It reveals the underlying meaning of a sentence in a way that makes it easier for other people to understand what you want to tell them. This is because it tells them something about your beliefs, beliefs that you would like to share with them, about how you expect their opinion to be. Grammar reveals a lot about you, who you are and who your audience is. So, when you have to communicate to another person, you can do it well by making use of this knowledge. For example, if you know how a certain word, phrase or sentence is constructed, then you also know exactly how the other person will hear this message you're sending. You also get the chance to better express your ideas and to make yourself understood. In addition, it provides a sense of confidence for a successful job. If you practice and become proficient in it, in turn, this can help you to build trust with other individuals. However, most people don't realize this and don’t know or simply don`t bother to learn it. When they are not in the habit of being conscious about their own grammar and when they don' t know the different parts it's made of, what they say will not seem clear to their audience. They can even create misunderstandings, which can lead to awkward or even painful situations. As a result, I have a passion for helping you improve the quality and clarity of your communication so that it works in harmony with the world around you. I also want others to know that they have options. That's why I wrote this book to help others on their quest to become a better communicator, just to mention one thing. The book has a practical focus and offers you a number of tips and advice to keep in mind. By following my guidance step by step, as I suggest them for you in this ebook, the journey to a more successful communication will be much less arduous. Now, let's explore how we can use grammar to improve our communication. Read more ›

What is the intent that best describes it?","This is a tough one. We're trying to say that there can be many reasons why it doesn't work.

265,How Do I Make Contactless Work,Considering this utterance: How Do I Make Contactless Work What is the intent that best describes it?,"I want some contactless technology in my business, for example a contact card where the recipient can tap on the card and automatically transfer money and a password to my account.  The card would contain a QR code on it which is scanned and the transaction performed.
There would be a button on my website where an admin user can activate a new card, which will then automatically be given to any users who want one. The users can then scan the QR codes on each other's contact cards to pay for things on their accounts. It'd be useful to have a list of active cards so that the user could see who has given me credit and who hasn't. I have no idea how to make this work...
When we're talking about NFC cards, is it simply a matter of having them on a reader, and they'll work? What if I make a business card with a card on, so a customer taps on them and then has to swipe it on another reader? How would this not be like using a physical card instead of a phone?
Does anybody have any ideas on what to do here? I just don't know what I want, really...   It seems like this would make more work for both the company and customer than a normal card? But would it have more security? Does this already exist and I'm just thinking too broadly? Please help!
(This is just a sideproject to learn something, I'd never make anything like a real-life product from this)
Thanks a lot!  :)
Edit:
A bit of research has been done, but I still don’t really know how this is done. There appear to be multiple protocols, including NFC. For example, here is an article that explains it all. https://www.hacksparrow.com/blog/nfc/. It says this can all be done over bluetooth, however, this seems really inefficient. Here's another article I found: https:/www/thewirecutter. com/reviews/best-n...
As this article says, you would have to write the data yourself onto the RFID chips on your business cards. However if there's a better option (not really sure what that would look like), I‰d love to hear it. Thanks so much! :)  I know it›s a pretty broad question, please tell"
266,What Is The Charges For New Card?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Charges For New Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What could it mean for a person to have a new credit card? Or do these questions not make sense?

The charges are a form of punishment in the legal system that makes a court order your money or assets to pay for another's crime. You can have your assets seized and your wages garnished by the courts if you don't pay what the defendant owes.
You could even have to go to jail if the victim chooses to press charges and they decide to arrest you for not paying them. This is why you'll hear people say things like: ""he's got the charges, the debt and the house.""
In other words: This isn't a fun game; it isn' t a ""party."" This debt is more serious than you know. There is a very good reason that you can't ignore it and there will be legal consequences if he files charges. It's very serious. The person who has the charge will take money from you to compensate for the loss. They have the right to take your property and to make you go bankrupt for having this debt. In the United States, most states have laws that give the person with the debts a legal right over your body or your real estate for paying it. If you default, if is possible you could go into jail. Even in Canada, I'm surprised that this is not a criminal offense of ""fraude."" Maybe the US has laws for this that are different than in Europe. I hope it's different. At the very least, it sounds very scary and if there is someone with a problem they can go get help, like a lawyer, to work things out. Maybe they should talk to a friend or family member who might be able to help you. Do not ignore this situation: It is NOT a game and it is very real. And, even if they don’t press criminal charges against you, they could still take the money that is owed to them from your bank and garnish your check. When that happens, every dollar you have will belong to the creditor. So, when they get the paycheck, your employer can give them money because he has legal permission to, and you will owe them at least some amount of the total that the check gives to you or the government. Your bank could also give your paycheck money to someone who is asking for your debt to be paid, but again it will reduce the amount that"
267,The Contactless I Have Won'T Work.,Considering this utterance: The Contactless I Have Won'T Work. What is the intent that best describes it?,"To be polite or to state a fact? Would that I could answer in a way that could satisfy the question. It's quite a tricky question to answer without knowing the context.

The contactless card has a chip and a micro reader on the ATM and in the cash register. They are connected with the POS computer. That is, the chip tells the card what it wants, and the computer makes it. The POS is a separate machine, not inside the register itself. So a transaction could not be completed in this manner. But the person would have to enter their PIN to get the money."
268,Why Isn'T My Contactless Not Working?,Considering this utterance: Why Isn'T My Contactless Not Working? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This is what you do:
You have a contactless bank card and the bank asks you to contactlessly pay for something. You do, you're all done, it's done. It works.
The bank sends a message to the POS system to record the transaction and then it will be added in the merchant's account the following day. This is when the problems start. When you check in that day you don't see the payment, the charge is pending in your account and when you go to pay it is still pending and now the message you received is: ""Your payment is not recognized.""
What is going on? Is the account blocked? If this was a debit it would be, right? 
If the question is why you got that message if you did everything right and you have the card that the system asked you and it worked, we're getting into the weeds of the technology here. We are getting very close to something called ""security"" that is an important issue to address. The message is trying to tell you that your device may have been compromised and/or that there is a technical issue with your credit card. There has been a number of these in my time. I'll let you read this link for your information on the whole matter. https://www.cip.org/CIP-Guide/Payment-Transaction-Processing
So what's going wrong? Well, for most of us who are not security experts, but for those who know how to get into these things, if the problem is that someone has taken over someone else's contact less card, then there are two ways to try to fix the situation. If you can get someone to do it, have them call a help line or go into a store to ask. Sometimes the help desk knows how many cards it gets a day and will tell it to someone. Most of them don’t have security specialists, they just know the basics. Or you may be lucky to find an employee whose job it was to check cards. So get the employee to look up the information for you.  If they don' t have that information or it doesn't match what they should be getting, get a manager. Make some phone calls, try different things. Maybe it can be cleared up. At the end of this I hope you will have some insight into how and why this is happening"

270,It Didnt Work When I Tried To Pay Contactless At The Bus Today. Why?,Considering this utterance: It Didnt Work When I Tried To Pay Contactless At The Bus Today. Why? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is there an implied meaning? What emotions do I get? Why does that emotion trigger a feeling? And the rest of the story?

1. I don't need a reason for this question. There are many possible answers. 2. When it's a one-word answer, it probably needs one word (not sure whether the one should be an adjective or an adverb).
3. For ""It didn't work when I tried to pay contactless at the bus today. why?"", the answer is ""I don’t know."" Or if there is other intention behind this, such as you are trying to convey a sense of frustration, you might write ""Why is it always me who has to do the research?!""
4. The ""it"" refers to the ""pay with the contactlessly"" (contactless payment, contact-less payments, etc.), so the question is asking why you couldn't pay, even though that is something that you could do easily at other times. Asking why something is always happening to you is not a valid question; instead you should say why does this happen.
As for the first sentence, the word ""why"" is more like a rhetorical question, rather than a grammatically valid one. You can say ""What is your question?"" or ""Do you have a question?""."
271,I Am Not Able To Do Contactless.,Considering this utterance: I Am Not Able To Do Contactless. What is the intent that best describes it?,"I'm looking for a more specific answer than 'it means the person isn't sure if he's able to do it right now'. I feel this might be somewhat ambiguous since 'I am' is a general statement. Does he mean he is unable to use that particular function at this point in his life? Or, that he isn’t able (as in now)? I understand if this is just a case of semantics and that the context of the question is all that's needed, or I'm over analysing it.

A:
–
For instance, if the man asks a woman 'Do you have a car?' and the woman replies 'No, I just walk' the answer will imply the lack of a means of transport. 'Can I come to see you?' might mean 'yes, of course you can'. The question would thus seem to be asking the girl if she is able - that is, has the capacity - to leave her house. 
This answer by 'Aravind' might also be useful. He gives a link to another post, which may help with what it is that we want to know. To summarise though, it seems like you want the opposite."
272,How Do I Use Contactless Payments?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Use Contactless Payments? What is the intent that best describes it?,"It’s pretty clear what “How can I use a contactless payment” means and the answer is pretty easy.
To use contact less payments just insert your card, either in the chip reader on your wallet or in your phone and start using your credit or debit card. If your device isn‘t supported by the bank, it won‚Äôt even show up on the screen. The contact point isn't used. This is a payment solution based on wireless, which you just need to plug in with the contactlessly equipped chip. In this way, the use of your account information isn'¬†used. That‹ªs it. It'›¹™s as simple as a card swipe. No more cards to carry, no more PIN's to remember. Your card is ready to go wherever you are. There are no longer any lines, and no one has to know your personal information."
273,Help Me With My Contactless Which Isn'T Working.,Considering this utterance: Help Me With My Contactless Which Isn'T Working. What is the intent that best describes it?,"The first thing that comes to mind for me is, ""I am in need of assistance with my contactless card."" That said, the sentence is quite odd because a ""contactless"" card is not something you are ""with"" or that can possibly be ""help me with"" because that just doesn't make sense to me.
I also have a hard time seeing how one can be said ""helping"" with one another in this way. Helping someone with something usually implies helping them achieve a goal that they have set themselves, and that is certainly not the case here, since the only thing you seem to have to ""do"" is use the card. 
So, what is it, that the speaker wants? What was the first impression? And then what? Does ""which isnt working"" help to give any more insight?"

p.s. I don't mind the $10.00 fee - but I would like to know about what you would advise to charge. Please keep the answer honest. :)
I'm trying this because it's the only payment method available for me on the phone I have that's connected to my bank. The merchant doesn't accept the credit card I've used (I know, because they said it wasn't supported on their merchant account). I'm using a mobile phone to connect and scan. My mobile is not connected with my banks ATMs, so it doesn’t work to just type in the number manually. 
In the past, when I‘ve used Apple Pay or the Android Pay, I was able to pay by just placing my phone on top of the merchant‚s terminal, and it would just automatically work as long as it had a good wifi connection. But I haven”t seen that option for the Contact Less Pay. Can I still use that in my situation by using that feature? Or is there a separate way to make it work? I am in Singapore. Would it also be an option if I had the app on my computer?  I do see that the Apple store has a scanner and you just swipe your card, but the merchants still get this thing that I guess converts it to contact less. So why is it that some merchants won‛t do that? Do they get the cash back? Thanks  .

 ""I can pay without making a payment beforehand?""  
I know it is not a yes or no question but I am really trying to figure out if the sentence: ""Do you need an invoice?"" is a Yes or No?

A: I need a refund?  -> no
If the payment is to pay off a bill  you can say: Yes I do need the invoice? but if you are referring to an amount on a credit card, no you don't need it.
An invoice is like a receipt in that it shows where and to whom something was paid.  An invoice tells you something but doesn't have to."

Or should I continue doing business as usual? I know that in either case I am taking business to the internet.
Which option, if any is more likely to make me successful? (This is obviously a question of business, not personal.)
(I'm aware that Google offers a hosted solution, but I have no familiarity with it; would it be better or worse for this purpose than a standard online web app.)  

 Update 2: I'm still looking for other options besides the standard web hosting solutions. The question still stands, should i stay the course with my current hosting solution or consider other possibilities? Please don't vote this down.  I really do need to know which way to go. Thank you!
Update:  The answer is: it doesn't matter, as long as I pick one. I went with the hosted Google solution. In case anyone else is on the fence about this:
Hosted Google checkout was a bit of a pain in the ass to figure out. This is a good write-up. Also, don’t let them trick you into setting up their own Merchant Account and then take over the chargeback processing for you. Don”t get me wrong, that is an attractive feature, and it makes them more attractive, so don""t make that mistake. However, be aware of how they manage chargebacks (the same way that they do it) and whether they will take the liability for your account. My understanding was that if you had a complaint with their service, you are responsible. You don`t want that. So, make sure that you understand exactly how charge backs work before you choose this. It is not a bad service to have on your list. Just make certain that it does not take more then 2 days to resolve charge back situations. They are also a little more expensive, about $10/month more than the regular rate. But they have some very nice features, such as auto-captchas. Check their web site for all the details. If you go that route, I`m going to stick with you and you will learn from my experiences. Hope this helps someone else."

281,I Would Like To Make A Transfer. How Much Does It Cost?,Considering this utterance: I Would Like To Make A Transfer. How Much Does It Cost? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What are you trying to communicate?

To be able to transfer is usually thought of in a negative sense, as in “I can’t make a move.” However, there are many situations when it is quite acceptable, particularly in business. If you have read any of my articles on business writing, you will have come across one of the ‘rules‘ that I advocate that can only be expressed properly through writing. You need to write in the right style, to the audience you are targeting.
A common mistake I come from time to time is trying the wrong word or phrase when I am writing for business, or for that matter any other audience, so it can be good to know the difference between the positive and negative meanings. This can save your blushes if you accidentally use the first negative form, without knowing what is going on. I‏ wrote a blog post on a similar word, I Want To…
If you look at this post, and at the comments below the page, it will help you to understand the meanings of these terms when you come up against one in your next business or personal situation. It might just help to make you sound a bit more professional, a little better. After all, the more that people understand that you speak the language, they are likely to listen to you more. And they have heard you say: ” I want to…“ before, now they can listen in. ‭I‬ would like to‭… can mean:
I want
It can also mean „ I really do not want„. When you use this, try ‪I would really be grateful to do this. Or: When it comes to a formal business situation, ‫I really would/would not like‫. (‹‮I Really Want ™›). When using this one, use with care. The negative connotation may be quite inappropriate in some business situations. So, if I were talking about the job I had, for example at work, then I would probably use:  I Really Would‪ Like‥ To‚ Transfer To. A different situation could be, my brother has just asked to move back to his home town to help out his parents, who are very ill. He would love to get back involved with what he"
282,"I Need To Make A Transfer, What Will The Fee Be?","Considering this utterance: I Need To Make A Transfer, What Will The Fee Be? What is the intent that best describes it?","This utterances is a good sample to analyze its usage since it is made up of 2 short clauses with only a conjunction (a semicolon). The first, as a main clause, consists of one verb: need. The second is an example of a subordinate clause with a verb form of the same type of verb. You will have to use some common sense to decide which verb fits best.
If you think about the need to make a transfer as an imperative statement, it means you are telling someone to do something. I want you to transfer your money to the company account because it's urgent. This would make make transfer a command. On the other hand, the fee, being a noun, describes the action of earning. As for the verb being used, fee would be correct, but need would also work in this case. 
The most common usage would probably be the imperative need, because of its more direct nature. But, if you wanted to say it as something more like ""I want to earn money"", then need is probably the way to go."
283,If I Make A Top-Up Are There Charges Applied?,Considering this utterance: If I Make A Top-Up Are There Charges Applied?

Would one say ’I want the truth“? or ‚I ask you the meaning of „the truth' ‟? If the first, the former. If he/she wants the second, he or she does not know if it is a ”yes„ or a, ″no‟. This is how a speaker can become lost in a sentence and not be able to distinguish between the two, if he / she doesn‚t know the true subject. ′s a common mistake.
What is meant by ›‹ I make a top-up'. Does it imply making a small or large topup payment. To clarify this, I will provide additional information on this question:
The question I asked the person on the phone who had given me instructions on ※ the payment system at the hotel I was staying in. As I explained this situation to him, we had a conversation in English and he said to me, when I said that I wanted to make the top up. I made ‹the› top, up and I did not charge him anything.

285,Are Swift Transfers Accepted?,Considering this utterance: Are Swift Transfers Accepted? What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:
...the best way to describe intent as a rule of thumb is ""do the right thing.""
It's not just a set of rules, nor is it a ""policy statement,"" but an example of the best use of intent in the circumstances at hand.  That is, we use intent to make a judgement call about the appropriateness in our language and our speech in a specific situation.
So, for example, if someone were to ask: ""Do you have any intentions on your mind?""  This would be an odd question:  it implies, at least, that there are other things on the speaker's mind. (And if there aren't, then this is a strange sentence, and not a question at all -- at best it would just be a statement.)  But it's a very odd thing to say -- it doesn't really mean anything at the level of speech. If instead you said ""Are there any things that are going through your head?"" then that makes far more sense: that is much closer to what you actually mean by ""intention,"" and it means something."

288,Are There Any Sort Of Fees Involved For Top Of Transfers?,Considering this utterance: Are There Any Sort Of Fees Involved For Top Of Transfers? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I'm guessing it means, 'There are some fees involved when buying and selling bitcoins for fiat currency'.
Is the answer 'Yes' correct as far as the above utterances go? Or does it need to include a 'When' as in, for example, when a buyer wants to transfer a bitcoin to the seller?  What I'm really trying to understand is is there always a cost involved regardless of whether that cost is paid in fiat or some other form of currency, whether the fiat is bought or sold? Does it ever cost the buyer or seller any other thing? Is the 'fees' always based on the exchange rate between fiat and bitcoin? or could there be some sort of fee charged to buy or sell bitcoins in which the cost might be a percentage of the price or a fixed amount of fiat? I would really like to know if it's possible I could sell 10 bitcoins to someone (for example) for 0.001 BTC if I have some of my fiat money in my wallet. If I do that then can I be charged an amount for the transaction just like if there was a bank or broker transaction? If so is it possible to do such a transaction without a fee? And how much might such  a transfer cost? Are there some things I don't know about? Any help would be appreciated, and please feel free to correct any mistakes if you think they exist.
Many thanks in advance. 
(I hope this question hasn't been asked before, I did a quick search but I couldn't find anything. It is also possible that my questions are quite simple and are very poorly phrased as they are.)
EDIT: The above link is a duplicate of this. The duplicate question is more comprehensive but the original question has a bounty which has been awarded so it looks like the bounty may have been a factor in it being marked as a question of interest. Sorry if the duplicate has bothered readers. Thanks in the any case. I've added the link so that people can easily find the question I want to discuss. Many thanks all. :)
P.S. In my original post I was thinking of using the bitcoin network for such transactions. But I see that some people might think it can have a negative impact on transaction fees if bitcoins are being sold by a company as some form or other of payment for a product or service."
289,Is It Possible To Get A Transfer From Swift?,Considering this utterance: Is It Possible To Get A Transfer From Swift? What is the intent that best describes it?,"1.   A: I have a lot of experience with programming and Swift, but I'm completely lost when it comes to using a Transfer.
This utterances is very similar in the sense that the word ‘Transfer’ is used in a “non-finite” form. That is to say that it is not a noun but a verb, which means that this is a very ambiguous utterence and we cannot understand the purpose of the sentence and what the speaker really wants to know. Hence, is there a way to interpret it as a question? 
2. A : Is it possible of getting transfer from Swift. I've been told to use Transfer, and the program works. But I cannot get my hands on any. This makes it very frustrating in using the Swift language. Is there any help on this? I think you can understand what I mean. Any help is highly appreciated. Thanks. Please do reply. :)
In this case the main problem is that ”Is it possbile‍?“ is just a simple question, it doesn‘t add any context to the uttering so the user will only understand that there is some problem in understanding the language when they hear that. So, we can‚Äôt understand why the person is asking this question in particular. We should also note that in this particular sentence, the question does not have an answer and hence should not be used to make a request but just to ask about something. There might be many things you are asking but the problem with your utternce is what you have written. You can change it to:
„I‡m confused about my understanding about the transfer in Swift"".  In this sentence I changed ‚Is there‛ and „to get‟ to ’Am ‰I confused‮ and ‬‹about my understand of › to remove any ambiguity. Then the next part ‍ ‏‌‗ about transfer‎     can be  changed to 'about the understanding of transfer'.

295,Are There Charges For Receiving A Sepa Transfer?,Considering this utterance: Are There Charges For Receiving A Sepa Transfer? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I want to know if anyone is charged for receiving an SEPA transfer?
  Can you please explain me if the above sentence conveys the intended meaning (I am asking for an explanation of how the sentence can be interpreted to have this meaning)?   Are there charges for getting a Separately Collected Payment (SOCP)?
What are the implications of the charge of £500 for this situation? Does this have an immediate or long term impact on my financial situation/debt? Is this something that will be automatically deducted from my bank account? Or is this a case of me having to take legal action to recover such a charge? If so, what is my chance of success? Can I ask the bank for compensation? What would be the process for such compensation from the banks point of view? Could such an outcome occur before I know about it (i.e. the day after the transfer)? Can this compensation be recovered as part of any recovery process if I win my case against my original creditor? Would my chances of winning be much higher, if my creditor was a UK bank? I don't have the money to afford a solicitor right now.
How common is it for people to get charged a ""recipient charge""? For example, this is what I am referring to in the linked question.  What about in other countries? Any examples? Do you think that these charges are fair? Are they justified by Separation Europe? Who are they being charged by? And are people complaining of these ""charges"" a minority or not? My question is whether these people will win in practice, and if so then why do they not get a refund? Why does such practice persist? How can it be addressed? Should they have to win a legal case to receive a compensation for the charges? To what extent are these costs recovered by the creditor banks in general? Has anyone ever been paid for ""costs"" charged in this way? In general if this charge is not justified how often do people win? As with the UK situation above. Are these UK banks the only ones charging ""Recipient Charges""? Are the other EU countries as bad or are there any other European countries which charge people in such ways? For similar transactions. How do other people get around such charges in their respective countries/banks? With regard to the SEPAs in UK, have they ever"

297,Will I Be Charged If Someone Needs To Send Me Money?,Considering this utterance: Will I Be Charged If Someone Needs To Send Me Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The speaker’s intent is likely a matter of what they expect the other person will do in response, that is, will they respond with money? If they do, then they have a motive to make sure the person they are talking to understands that they need money to pay for their needs. However if the listener does not react with cash, this means the speaker is not expecting this response; if nothing else, perhaps a response that makes clear how much cash is needed. This would not be an expected response. So, I am not sure about the meaning of this sentence. It might be one of two or three ways, depending on the context. If I was talking about a business context, for example, it would be: Do I Need To Charge The Customer For The Work? That is if someone is paying you for a service to do something for them, in this context that means, “Do I need to bill them for my services?”

The other meaning is that someone might say it in a conversational manner. That means it is talking with your close friend or loved one. You might ask them that question if you were concerned that you didn‘t really know how that person felt. I think the more likely meaning would involve the business or the service.
This sentence comes up in some contexts with an important point. For example: Should A Doctor Be Able To Make Money While Treating Sick Patients? What I have come to think of as ‘the money question‬‭.‪
I like this because the point it makes comes across as an essential. The doctor might think he can afford to take that extra time to help the patient, which would likely be good, but if it means losing money in the long run, is it worth it to him? It is a basic question and an ethical one and the doctor is faced with it. In my case, the question has often been, Should My Doctor Tell Me About The Bad News That Might Not Improve My Health?
So how I came to use this question was because, even though doctors are not supposed to profit out of their work (though there have certainly been doctors who have), it isn‚t always possible to know whether what you are telling a patient is going to be beneficial in improving their health without asking them what it will cost you. But there may be situations"
298,What Are The Fees For Top-Ups?,Considering this utterance: What Are The Fees For Top-Ups? What is the intent that best describes it?,"A statement of fact: ""I did not have a car for my high school graduation. I had to rent one,"" or a suggestion (perhaps a command): ""Get yourself a vehicle so you won't have to take taxis everywhere.""

I believe that people understand that I'm trying to communicate something here. And if I were to add my own opinion to this dialogue, I would think it is more likely a statement because I see no suggestion that the student should not rent a ride. The intent is simply to explain why renting is not the same as having a loan from a bank.
This leads me to believe ""What's the fee for a top-up?"" is a good question because it has the potential to bring light on a situation. However this sentence is still rather ambiguous. 
What are the fees for top ups?

Can it be said that this is an example of rhetorical questions? Rhetorical questions are often used to express a preference (such as ""Is pizza good?""), doubt (Is this a real question?), or doubt as to the accuracy of statements and opinions (How could you be so certain?). Here's my reasoning:
A rhetorical question is used when the speaker would like his words to persuade. For example, if the question was ""Why did you vote for me?"", the point of the conversation would be that you voted for him. This question does not need an answer, or does it only need to have an appropriate response? If the person does respond and you like the response, that's great. If you don't like it, then it would have been better if you had never responded. Either way, the rhetorical nature of this question has not changed. It still says the exact same thing as the previous question without having to provide an explicit answer. (You can read more about rhetorical questioning in ""The Riddle of Rhees"")
2
How does this differ from ""A question which may be answered 'yes' or 'no' but requires no further communication from answerer."" In other words, this answer could still be given:  ""There's no fee. No one makes money. We help out friends.""   This type of question can often be interpreted as if an argument is coming from the answerers. Even though this could technically be considered part of your argument for no one making profit off this situation, it does seem"

300,What Are The Charges For Receiving Money?,Considering this utterance: What Are The Charges For Receiving Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"(Intonation plays a big role here, but it is also about what the person says). The first thing we need to do is to determine that the sentence has a Subject. To do that, we must look for a “He” or a ""She’ (pronoun) or something else that could be a subject.

So let‘s do this by using the process of elimination. The sentence clearly has ’he“, or maybe even a simple pronoun. It can„t be „She,‟ because she would have said ‚I want, I like, and so on.‚

301,What Is The Fee To Receive Money?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Fee To Receive Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it a question or an instruction? Or does it mean something entirely different?

If your goal is to sell people something (or, at the least, get their attention), you probably don’t want to say “What fee should I charge to make a million dollars?” That sounds like a lot of trouble, to tell someone they have to charge you a fee to give you money. If you‘re not going to pay someone to teach you how to double your income, you don't say that; you say you want them to help you understand how it's done so you can do what they did.

302,How Much Am I Charged For A Sepa Transfer?,Considering this utterance: How Much Am I Charged For A Sepa Transfer? What is the intent that best describes it?,"It could be:

A. To ask about a transfer of savings.
[Example: I’ve got money I want to transfer. Do you charge me?]
B. A simple question to see what the price is. [Example, I don‘t remember if I transferred money from my current account to the savings account I set up with my employer.]
C. The intent is unknown [the speaker has no idea about the transaction fee.] [The speaker might not even be aware that a fee exists, or they didn‟t think to ask the question]
D. I can―t transfer money at this time. Maybe later. There must be a charge. This is common sense. It”s how I have to do it. If I asked how much is it to take a trip, that would be ridiculous. That„s too much. No way!
E. “Transferring money“ can be defined as an activity that involves a third party and money. Thus it would make good sense that there is an associated charge [transference fee] to perform this activity, and as a result of this, one is charging. (Note: This definition could also be used for a transaction of any monetary value between two parties.)
It‡s not clear whether this question refers to (a) or (c), or if one of them is right and the other is wrong. But at least there are two possible interpretations, neither of which makes sense to answer with a price of X. However, the answer can have a meaning: (※) „It is not possible to have this transaction performed.‖ This implies that (the question asks) how would I like to receive this money?
So the following options are available. They all seem to be plausible. 
Option A. How can I receive my money [from the Separation Account]?  (I‚ve never heard of a separation account.) I will need a bank, right? I won‹t receive it in cash, but I would need to deposit it through a check. Does it cost anything? This could mean a withdrawal from a savings or checking account or something else.

What are the pros and cons of each sentence?   And, why can't I say something like that, as if I had found the answer to that question? Can you also help me with the correct phrasing? I hope it will not lead to more controversy. Thank you so much for all the help. :)
PS: I know that the question should be about Separating of Money, not Separation. Still it could be helpful to read the context in which this phrase has come. If it was in a sentence like ""How much is it to transfer money between two banks?"" or ""What is how much cost to do this?"" the sentence is clearer and easier to be understood. Because I am not sure that my question will be more clear by just adding ""Separated from"". If anyone still has an issue with it, please clarify in the comments below. ;)  Thank-you very much.

EDIT: After reading the answers, can you guys tell me if there's any differences between these two sentences in meaning? (I mean the ones I've provided)
""How Much is The Transfer Fee?"" vs ""Where's the transfer fee?""
And, if the meanings are exactly same, then why do we use the first one? Or maybe, we don't use it and only use ""The transfer fees""  because ""Transfer fee"" has a more formal connotation or something similar. (Sorry, I'm not a native speaker) :$  Thanks. Also if you have any better ideas for the title of the this post, feel free to give me some suggestions. Cheers. <3
Also, to clarify again, this is just about finding what is ""transfer fee""? The context is, ""I was just talking to a friend of mine about transferring money and my friend said something that I couldn't quite understand. So then I asked him 'what is transfer?'

I have been requested to provide the documentation, but due to confidentiality issues (and other reasons beyond my control) I cannot disclose the exact details.

PS: English is my native language. Please, don't bother with grammar mistakes and such like. The point is to convey the message, not to express some academic niceties. Also note for future readers that there is a typo in the text: should be ""topping up"".
Update: I found some related cases (in particular, the article on Wikipedia states that some cases are still pending on legal basis in Europe, some time passed now since the event. However, as a layman, in my experience it seems that these cases have nothing to do with ""money laundering"", but with tax evasion. So, they're not what I'm looking for)
Also, Wikipedia claims that even if there are no legal cases, there can be some other forms of prosecution in some countries. In fact, according to Wikipedia there has been an attempt to use the money laundering legislation to cover money transfers between banks (this might be a bit off topic though).
The question is still open. Feel free to comment. You can do it by using your account on this forum or by writing an answer. Thank you. Hope this helps. Cheers.

309,Is There A Fee For A Transfer? If So How Much Will It Be?,Considering this utterance: Is There A Fee For A Transfer? If So How Much Will It Be? What is the intent that best describes it?,"To what kind of transfer? Who is receiving the transfer. For what purpose? Is the answer that depends on the answers to those questions?

This is a really good question; it seems to be one of those that is either answered by the law of unintended consequences or that we should be able to answer it by thinking about it carefully (for this reason I’m not sure it is even a good “law of” question). I think it has to do with the way we conceptualize agency in a way that makes it a bit more complicated than it really is.
I think the reason we have to ask whether the fee is for a ‘transfer‘ (or, in your example, to what ’kind of a transfer“) and to whom it would be a tax is that the word ”agency„ itself can be ambiguous. I know that I use it to mean „involving a legal contract‟ or to ‚give a person authority or responsibility to act on behalf of someone.‛ The word, then, doesn‚t always convey a specific meaning, which is why ‡we have dictionaries‡ (and in my case, I have several) to clarify. But as a lawyer, even without a dictionary I already know what it means. You can look it up yourself (•) (http://www.merriamwebster.com/dictionary/agency).
And as far as I can tell, that definition can also be used for taxes and legal fees. It is true that this usage is very rare in common speech, but I don›t see that as being important. If we don't have an agreed-upon standard and vocabulary that clearly distinguishes between taxes on transfers (what taxes is this?) and fees (this is not an agency fee), we cannot be sure when something is or isn‰t a fee. To me it s not important that people use the words as they are used in law; I see my role as interpreting the meanings the people are ascribing (when I do my job, at least). But I might be wrong, and in that case I will need to change my opinion. We can't assume to know. So the only way of answering this question is by asking more questions: ""What"

What is the intent that best describes it?,"For many years I thought it had to deal with the fact that we would have to use a ""Swift"" Transfer in the United States, but that is not the case at all. As of the end of 2014, there are currently three Swift Tranfers in operation in Australia. These are: the Western Australian Swift, the Australian Capital Territory Swift and the Sydney Swift. So what is a Swift transfer?

Swifts, or Air Travel Tax, are a tax that you are charged on each trip that includes a flight with a distance of 1,000 miles or greater. This tax is currently $40, and is charged to you in two payments. The first is called an Air Passenger Rebate, which is an amount equal to 70% of your taxable purchase price. It is only applicable on flights booked and made within Australia or on foreign flights from or to Australia that are booked less than 60 days before the date of departure. For more information on the Swift Rebates, visit the ABTA's Swift site here
(http://www.swift.com/ABTA/). The second is for a full amount of $60. You are only charged this tax if you purchase a ticket outside of Australia, you board your flight outside Australia and you depart from and arrive to an airport or city located in another country.
In Australia we only pay tax on our trips and not on what we purchase and this is what the AATO (Australian Air Ticket Office) is able to do. In other countries that use the ""Sale and Return"" (or Transfer) process, when buying a trip, they are able
to charge the $50 tax as well as the full price of their ticket. If they do not, a foreign transfer will not be considered an Australian transfer, as it is considered to be the same as foreign travel. (http.//www,australianairtickets.gov.au/AusTax/Swft.htm).
As with all foreign transfers, it may be that certain items that can be transferred between the country are exempted
from the tax. However, even in those countries where this ""exemption"" policy exists, many airline companies
will transfer the taxes if the customer is eligible for their own. A foreign Swift tax transfer can only take place within 60
days of booking the flight you wish to transfer. Within that 60 day time frame"

If you want to attract a millionaire to work with you but aren't sure how to find them, you might be thinking that you need to be super rich to get this. But the truth is there are many other ways to use social media to bring in a high-net-worth client. For example, we know that Instagram is great for bringing in new clients. This is because people use this platform on a daily basis to connect with others and learn about their interests.

318,Can You Tell Me The Total Cost Of A Transfer?,Considering this utterance: Can You Tell Me The Total Cost Of A Transfer? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The following is excerpted from a recent paper by Mark A. Johnson, PhD, of the University of Colorado at Boulder.
I’ve written about Johnson and this paper in a number of contexts, so I won”t repeat that here (see, for example, this article). Rather, the excerpt below describes his use of computational modeling to explore how people interpret a complex utterances, and to predict their responses, given different wordings and word orderings. The paper (with the figure to the right) has just been posted to a website, where it can be downloaded, read, commented on/criticized and even critiqued in turn. (Note: it is a free download, but the website where you can get it has a limited number [100 or so] of complimentary page views. It is easy to see how that might lead to an interesting and illuminating process of exchange between the article‘s authors and their readers, with each adding a dimension to understand the other“s position.)
Johnson and his colleagues developed an experiment to test the effect (if any) of word ordering in predicting an audience„s interpretation of such an uttering. They used computational linguistics software to simulate the production of utterings by computer, based on “naturalistic‟ recordings of people producing speech. This is called the „Speaker Simulation Model‚ (SPIM), which can generate utterants in several different styles. In one of them, called ‚S-SPIN,‛ there is ‒ like in real human speech‹ some variation of subject-verb-object word sequence order (as in ‘the transfer amount is‏ £9.95‒, vs. ‹Can you tell me… how much… the transfer… costs?‡ ”) The SPIM also can create utterations in the so-called ‟canonical‖ word-order of English, which is subject then-infinitive verb (e.g., ’I am learning…․ ›). These two variants, S-CAN and SPIN- CAN, were produced for this experiment. Participants were asked to read a series of brief paragraphs in which the utterant is included, followed by a prompt which asks the participants to indicate whether the sentence makes sense or not, or whether"

(This may be a duplicate - I didn't find a good duplicate, so I made a new post. This is my first post, and I'm not entirely sure how to answer it correctly.)
It is saying ""Please help me, because I need to cancel a transaction"".  It is not saying 
""Please cancel (or stop, or change,...) the transaction because..."",
because, in this case, the author of the utterances is trying to be persuasive.  The sentence in question would not be uttered to someone who was not already willing to help.
The meaning of ""I need..."" in the context of an ""utterance"" such as this is usually ""What is happening right now (at this moment) is that I am experiencing some problem or I want the person I speak to to take action and do something for me.""   So, with ""help me"", it is ""Because I have a problem right this second, I would like you to do for this problem something"".

There are also many interpretations for the words, limit or charge. In this particular sentence, there is a specific meaning to the word limit and I‘d like to get your opinion. Here is another sentence to consider:
Do you need to put me on a credit card if you don”t accept credit cards at your store? What meaning do you understand this sentence?

If you are going to buy a lottery ticket, and you think you’re buying a ticket with no chance of winning, your intent might be: The odds of me losing are greater than the odds that I win. But you know how it is, the chances that your ticket will win are really small, so buying that ticket is really a way of investing, not risking.
The meaning of the word investment is: 
‘Something that will give you financial security” and   ‘A way that makes an income.“ This is very close to the definition of risk:
a potential loss
You might not think your buying the ticket has any potential losses, but that may be because there has been no possibility of financial loss to you thus far. If you don‚t get any returns, or if the returns are so small as to make an investment of zero, then you may still have invested."

As with all things in our daily lives, there are many factors that can influence our perception of a person’s intent, and this is a good place to start. We‘ll go through the elements and explore each of them one by one.
We can use the 3-act theory of psychotherapy (see my other article on it here) or the 4-stage model of communication (I wrote about the stages of the model in this post) to frame this analysis. These models are not mutually exclusive. They are, in fact, complimentary as they are meant to complement each other and each describes the different components and processes of verbal or non-verbal communication. However, if we are interested in the verbal communication of this situation, we need to focus on the third act as that is where we have a conversation and therefore, where the most impact is meant. This article will, therefore focus only on verbal components of that conversation. It‚Äôs about intent. About who said what to whom. Or maybe who didn‛Ç¹t said that. In fact it‖Ù® a great topic for you to ponder. The point to all of these models is that we don”Å¼t know for sure, nor do anyone else, what the full story is in any of us until we get it out. And, for the purpose of our analysis, that means that all we know and can rely on is our own perspective on what“Ñ happened and how it is perceived by ourselves and others. For the sake of conciseness, I„À§Ü will focus specifically on “verbal cues‡¥.
Here is what I believe is important to understand about our verbal cues. When we express ourselves, even verbally, the goal for us is to get what we want to do or convey over as well as we can. If we feel the conversation or interaction isn‣Ð´t going the way we expect, or if it isn""Æ§Ò¡t working out as intended, then we often react, respond and sometimes react in kind.

Or is he stating,
""The restrictions only apply to top-offs.""
And is that last phrase being used to say, ""I'm confused and I know that the restrictions of top offs only applies to the top."" 
I would like to know which is correct because my textbook states
The only restriction is: ” No fuel can be added to a fuel tank that has been topped off. ""
But from the examples given:   ""The car‟s computer will turn off the engine and the car will not start."" I would have thought that would be a top up, not a topping off
Can someone please explain these examples of topping-off? Thanks !
EDIT:
Sorry about that I missed the word ""topping off"" at the end of that section!!!
That's what I was trying to understand.  I just thought it was a typo since it looks like an error in the text and not really anything to do with my initial question.
Anyway, I understand the meaning of ""stop-top- off"", the reason why the computer shuts the vehicle down is because of the restriction and why you are prohibited from starting it up again. Thanks for all of your help guys. :)
Now I have a new question that relates to that!!!!!!!!
In the question, the second sentence in paragraph 5 says  „If a vehicle can no longer be fueled with normal fuel or a certain level of fuel, it must be topped-up with another type of liquid. However, this does not apply when the fuel has already been added and topped of with the normal liquid fuel (which is why a normal top of is not allowed in paragraphs 8 and 9). ‟
Does that also mean it is a ""top off- a regular top"" or is it more of just ""a topping of?"" Thanks again!
Cheers for the help

the words of wisdom, they are the words used to sell
you the world. Words that are empty and
vague are all it takes to create a world that seems like a
fantasy. These politicians can talk of
nothing other than money that we have to make to be
happy. No wonder the people are so
unhappy with their government. We are told
to get jobs that pay enough that you can live on
them. But there are many who cannot
and will not take a job like that. If only
they could get a little help they would go straight
out and get it. This does not seem like the real world to
many, does it! We do not get the help we
need to pay our bills. It appears we do
not need help, we only need to get money in order to survive!
Is this what the politicians mean to tell us? If
so, it is a lie! They do know what is going
on. Do they think that a few people will listen? The
people are tired of listening to them. People
want to learn and not just listen. There are
too many politicians who are out of touch to the average
person. They just say the lines they need
for the TV program. In the meantime the
average person does nothing more than look at the screen
that they see all day. Then they go home
feeling like they have accomplished nothing. How
can the majority of the population think like
this when they know that the government is in the pocket
of big business? How can the same people
vote for the current people in office when the whole
county is being taken over by them? We have
already lost one election because of vote fraud and we are still
in the primary for 2012. Why can't the American
public have some say in what our government will
do and say? What will they do for us if we all
go out and vote for them or the other candidate? I
am sure they will just make more money for themselves and give
us nothing to show. The people vote and the money
starts to flow into Washington and Wall st. I just
cannot believe that they can think"

I Needed to Know What Your Limits are. I Want to know if You Know Them So You Can Tell Me If I can Do more. But I Am Not sure if this is really the best intent. Maybe I will change my intent if there is another better one. Please let me know. Thanks
Here is my thinking:
1) What are the limits on this? Are there limits for each of us? If so, where do they begin? How do you define your limits? Do you know your own limits in a way to define them? This could be a very difficult one but I think it is a good one for a conversation. It is difficult to think of limits to oneself and to others. We are bound by many things but some we do not know what them are and so are not able to communicate them. This may be difficult in itself, especially if it involves another person. If we were able, we could tell someone to do something that they will not be able. Or that we will be hurt by someone. In this context I need to be careful to not hurt someone with my own words or to make someone mad with an expression. For example, to say I do have limits and you need them so I cannot over do it. The other person who thinks they have more could get mad or say: ""You need a limit, I get one, you can do what you want to but be gentle. Be safe."" or ""That is fine I understand."" etc. etc...
2) Do I have a top limit? What if I go over that? Will I not get more? Or will it not make me angry that I went over my limit. Would I be more or less likely? Again we may have many limits. So we must be very careful in this one and ask others to respect the limit for us. Do they? Can they communicate to you that you have your limit or have they set limits with"

I don't think there is a single answer. It's not an issue of 'grammar'. It depends on the meaning of the question. 
Is it a question on what grammar is acceptable? No. You'd only be told that you need a semicolon if you asked, 'Is a colon always a punctuation mark?'.  Is it on whether a specific phrase is grammatical? Yes. That's what punctuating is. The meaning you are referring to is 'What is my maximum allowable limit of puncturing a word?' No punctus are needed for this. If you want to have a maximum, you can make it the same as the limit, that's one possibility.
You can't tell if the user is looking for a limit on how much he can punctuate. He could be asking for punctation as a general topic. Or he could just be wanting to know what is his maximum. No single word can express all of those ideas, so you have to make a choice."

A:
""I want to top my limit. Can you top me up?""
I would say no, this intent is different from the one you mentioned, because the word ""top"" doesn't describe the action you want done. You're asking for more. If you're trying to be humorous, I might say: ""can you blow up the planet so I can top""

338,Is There A Limit To Top-Ups?,Considering this utterance: Is There A Limit To Top-Ups? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This was my attempt at answering this questions.

I was also wondering what was your thoughts on the following scenario:
""I want my new car to be more powerful, so I will go to a dealer to buy an upgrade package. After talking with the dealer I decide that I would only like the upgrade if the car is more than 10% more expensive than the current model.""
It seems that the original intent was to go with a better more efficient engine but after a short conversation with dealer he says that a more ""powerful"" engine would mean more power which would be better for performance (but not the performance of the new model) so the price may not change. 
Now I am considering going with option B. Which would you recommend as better?
The original intention of doing this is to make better use of my finances because the more I spend on something, the easier it is for me to spend money again. (I do need more funds to pay for school and my expenses but not a large amount.) But as I was thinking about that, I can imagine a scenario where I end up spending more money on a car than I originally intended to because now I do have a higher standard.

I'm wondering whether it is okay for me to top-up with as many as
possible in order to get the best deal. Is this the correct
grammar for such an utterances? 
How would you describe this kind of uttering? Is it right to use the past tense? Why? What would be the difference if I used the present tense form? Please don't use 'ask' to describe the sentence. Thank you! I am not sure whether this is a correct question, but it will be nice of you to explain.   The question is regarding  the 'past of the verb to be'.  'To be' is to 'have' an attribute, or to possess something, so I assume it implies a past action, such as ""I have to work.""
The sentence is:
""The amount of money you pay can be changed as often as you want.""  ""You can change the amount as as frequently as is convenient."" ""The number of people you invite can increase as easily as possible."" It seems that the answer may depend on the verbs, ""pay"" and ""invite"".
So, I don’t know what is more appropriate as the tense of this sentence: ""Can I topup...""? I‘ve read the following question:  Does past or past perfect tense express the fact that a certain activity occurred before another activity? But I would like to know more and ask what the situation is like. Also please explain the meaning of each word, because my level of English is not very high. The definitions of 'change', 'invites' or 'pay', or whatever the case may be, are very useful. I hope you can explain as concisely as in short as it‌​ is possible, which I understand. For instance, can you define 'to invite' as a verb? Thankyou!
This is what I tried out so far. It might be okay. How are these phrases correct? How should they be used? Are such phrases as „top up"" or ‚„can't top you up""? Are these sentences grammatically correct or not? Can you also explain more about the “past” and ‘verbs'?  ’

344,Are There Limits To Top-Ups?,Considering this utterance: Are There Limits To Top-Ups? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Are the limits of our top-ups in any way defined by physics? I’ll leave a detailed explanation for another time. I would merely like to explore the thought.

I”m going to assume that you understand this concept. If not, I will clarify with examples from nature. Top up (“T/U  ​) means to supply a charge in a capacitor. You supply charge to a capacitors and it holds a certain amount of energy. The amount stored can be found in capacitance. It‘s the energy a particular capacitor can hold before the top up will reach its limits and discharge. So, a topup of a 1000μF capacitor holds 1000 μJ of charge. And a 20μH of coil of the inductance of 1000H will hold a total of 2000μJ. Or, in this example:
A capacitor of 0.1μ is discharged in 1 second. A capacitor with the same capacitive value of 1μ but half the size is recharging. In 4 seconds the capacitor will charge back to it‟s original capacitivy. Now, if you add another capacitor that„s half as big, it takes a bit longer. This new capacitor takes 8 seconds to charge the entire 0-1 μF cap. At first the charge will increase slowly. As soon as the new cap fills, the total voltage across the capacits‚ is reduced and the charging process will speed up. To keep the voltage at a maximum of 100 V, at the end of each 4-second charging period the current is decreased by 0,8 mA‡ per capacitor (and vice versa for a discharge).
What about inductive? A 20 μH inductor can only store a few hundred μj in one second and can‰t be topped up at all. But if the coil is connected in parallel to another inductors with a smaller inductivity it will be slowed down by a factor of 20 times. That‛s right, 20x times! If the other inductances cap is also connected to the power supply, you can get a voltage swing of about 10V. With another coil with smaller capacivity and an inductibility of, say 50μ you get only 250 μm of current! So it won t really speed your inductions up, they‍"

As long as you don't ask for feedback to change your mind, that is your choice. :)
The example shows that, given a choice between two options, the best choice is usually to go with the more difficult and/or complex choice to ensure the desired result in the most efficient way. This may mean taking a longer route, spending more time, and having to work around more potential obstacles. But it also means making a bigger difference at a cost of more effort. That is, in order to get to your desired destination, you may choose the path that takes longer. However, this doesn't mean there's always a maximum amount of top-ups. Rather, it just means there is a range of possible top ups in which you can make a significant improvement in efficiency, based upon a trade-off between your time and the amount to be invested. If you choose a low top up you will have much less impact but will be able to do a lot more with your money, if you chose a higher topup you would have more impact with a lower amount. You may or may not be ready to decide on topups or the cost/benefit ratio associated with each. In my experience, many people who have a goal to make more money can find the right balance that gives them the biggest impact for least cost. Those who need help in making the big decisions to invest in themselves may need more guidance in determining the exact top of how many topamps they will invest and at what cost to themselves. A high topamp level may be necessary to maximize your impact. I don’t know that you could give everyone that kind of guidance without some sort of study of the current individual and circumstances. So, a topuplist with many options would be very helpful. There is always going to a best approach for a given circumstance. It is what we each use and choose in our life and work that matters. Thanks for taking the time to share this. :-)

346,Do You Have A Top-Up Limit?,Considering this utterance: Do You Have A Top-Up Limit? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Do You Know Your Limit, Or Do Your Limits Know You? What will you do if you reach a tipping point? Will you continue on the path or stop, or will it be too late? You probably don’t even know what that tipping-point will feel like, but you will recognize it when you see it.
You could be in over your head and never know it until it‘s too
late. But you don't have to wait until disaster strikes to realize the warning signs. You could recognize them
on a daily basis. A top-up limit is something you set,
but it's more than a simple number; a top up limit can be an emotional, spiritual, financial or physical one. Some
people define it as a limit based on their resources. If you have
a budget or a credit card, a
top up may be based upon those things. And if your bank
account is getting low, you might define your
tipping point as the point at which you can no longer make
payments on a purchase. Or, it may
be based more on your emotions. Maybe it is that
last straw that breaks your budget, that you finally
feel compelled to have something special for
yourself. There are lots of top ups and
limiting factors. It is important to recognize
that if we allow our top upto
change over time, we might not be able to
know when it has changed, when we can
no longer do something we used to, before we
set the tipping
point, which might have been very helpful. We might
not recognize that we have crossed the line, until
it is too, too too later, and then too bad. So
setting an
upper limit helps to ensure that your resources (of whatever kind) are not drained, because you are aware of
where you stand today, instead of wondering how
you would feel when things got so bad, after
having set the limit you had in mind. This way, if
anything changes, such as you getting a new, improved job, the
job not working out or something better coming
along, then you won't feel so stressed and pressured if the income level or resources drop just a bit
from their previous level. Your
resources may have gone down in real dollars or
value,"

I feel like this is one of those things that it depends. Some people might look to the context and realize how ridiculous it sounds that a person would actually use ""don't need"", but then on the flipside you have that same person who doesn't realize it at the moment, and they say it out loud to a group of friends.

@Apostrophe: I know you are not trying, but I was wondering why ""you get"" in the last para was not in there instead of ""no go"". :) And I think the ""if it ws the first then..."" makes a lot of sense to me. You might get that ""yes, no, maybe"" kind of response. Not saying it will be 100% clear or right, just thinking out a hypothetical scenario for you. As for ""it depends"", it could be that if it is someone that you don´t know or have a history with then it would come off as ""in your face"" and if someone is ""close"" to you then they will understand. Or maybe it just depends on your relationship with the person. ""Thanks, I'm just going over to my friends right now"". ""Sorry, can I ask for my money back?"".

If they say they've got a limited number of euros in a card, they may then have an option to top it up via a bank transfer, without having to pay a premium (and possibly even getting a discount). That way, this would be a question about how to do something, not what is already possible and what you should do about it."
353,Is There An Amount Limit To My Top-Up?,Considering this utterance: Is There An Amount Limit To My Top-Up? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is there an amount limit I need to top-up to reach the maximum amount I want to spend? In other words, what is my credit limit? Are there any limits to the amount of top up I am entitled to? Can I only top it up up to a maximum of RM 50, 100 or even RM150?"
354,Is There A Limit For Top-Ups?,Considering this utterance: Is There A Limit For Top-Ups? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is this a question about the amount of top-ups and the types of them that would be acceptable? Or is it a comment about whether the top up in any one game was acceptable and if more than that is OK?

A:
[Q] Is there a limit for top ups? What are the limits? (i know a few have already answered the first, but i just want to make sure this is not a duplicate)
In short, no there's no cap, and it's totally up to you. There's a small chance that you'll find a player who's going to be unhappy or offended with your choices (not that we'll see it as long as you're using the right word count, grammar etc.). The only real limit I can think of is your reputation, which is basically the sum of all the games you've played on the site. If you get too many negative votes, the moderator who handles that case will lock your account.
You can play games, make top lists, play a bunch more games and top more lists. This means that your rep points will grow and you gain access to more privileges on a per-site basis. That's all that I know of that can possibly limit you; if it does, it'd be really really weird. 
As for the rules themselves, see the official rules, or the community FAQ, both are linked at the bottom. It's in the Help Center under Game Rules, under the General Guidelines (and you should also consider taking into account the FAQ section on how to behave)."
355,Is There A Maximum I Can Top Up?,Considering this utterance: Is There A Maximum I Can Top Up? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This is my first attempt at creating a thread for this question. Please feel free to add your input!
Thanks for having fun.

1. Is it correct to assume that you will always hit the max charge in a single recharge?
2. I am assuming that this recharge is a recharge to all 3 vehicles as opposed to just one. Does the answer change? If so, what changes? I would guess this would be because you would have more room for the recharge and more to recharge. But is there more? Or in other words, is it the same? The reason I ask is that one of my vehicles would only take 10-20 recharge tops, and I'd want to make sure I could still fully recharge it. Also, I've seen people say that it would depend on the type of recharge used (i.e. full recharge, half recharge). Are these assumptions correct? Is there a maximum I can top up my recharges? How many? What vehicle would this be for? Would it apply to ALL 3, or just my second or third? Thanks."

357,Do You Have Any Restrictions To My Top-Up?,Considering this utterance: Do You Have Any Restrictions To My Top-Up? What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:
.
The top-up has restrictions. But not in order to keep the balance. As a consumer you can make your top up to the credit cap, and they can also charge you for your over-charging. And as a supplier you need to make sure the top off the customer does not go below a certain limit. 
This would mean, that if they want to give you a bonus, you will need the following:"

359,Which Cards And Currencies Do You Support?,Considering this utterance: Which Cards And Currencies Do You Support? What is the intent that best describes it?,"If the reader wants to understand what is going on, the answer is ""no idea."" If they are in the market to buy or sell something, there is nothing in this message that can make them a winner. If, on the other hand, this text is trying to persuade the readers to support the ""proposition"" in an argument and is not trying very hard to be persuasive, then the most obvious way to think about this passage is as a ""conversation."" Someone said something about how they think things should be, and in order to respond, you have the choice of either agreeing with them or disagreeing with him or her.

Let's examine this conversation in a couple of different ways, so that we are all on an equal footing. The first way is to look at the meaning of the text. There is a problem with this first attempt, because the first meaning is that the person who wrote the card is telling you what they like/dislike about things right now, but that's not what the passage says. It says that this is someone's opinion of cards and currencies. That means that it is somebody's idea of what cards are good and which ones aren't, not something that is true at this moment in time. This is also not about buying things and selling things, which is what people usually think of when they consider buying or selling cards. They think that buying is about making profit. You're supposed to read this as if this person says, ""Here is my idea about cards, do I have anything better?"" It's something you could say to a friend, except that you do not have to say it to him/her. In effect, a person would say: ""I think cards should have ______,"" and you would respond: ""...And I think ______, maybe I should buy _____."" This does not mean that any one of these people has the only valid idea, or even the best idea. Rather, all of them have ideas that could be true. A person's beliefs are like the cards of a deck, mixed up in their head, just as their favorite cards could happen to have an edge over their least-favorite cards in that deck. We don't say that people shouldn't be allowed to believe what we like most. People should only be expected to behave responsibly, if they choose to do so. To give a concrete example - If Joe is"
360,Where Can I Obtain My Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Where Can I Obtain My Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it about the person's personal finances or the organization's business? For example: “I need an online card for our business.” Or, ” Our customers are complaining and we need a card right away. It must be fast and easy to setup so our customers get their card on-line fast. We need to get it in the hands of our clients quickly. How can you make this happen?“

The question is: How does an employee make a difference? The answer is clear. Employees must have the time and ability to focus on their job and the business at hand. If the employee is asked a question such as, ""Where can I find my virtual card?,"" chances are she does not have both. She could spend a good bit of time thinking, worrying, stressing, researching, and asking her team for answers. Then, she could have her assistant find a way to implement or make it happen. However, if the assistant has other projects that need her attention, this could delay the implementation and may be a source of stress for both the worker and her manager as the manager looks for that employee to take the lead.
This brings me to a second thought about how to make employees more focused, on top of having the resources and skills to do their jobs. In the last decade, there have been studies and articles done on how employees should be treated to achieve a more effective, productive workforce. There were a number of reasons stated and some that made no sense. The article ‘The Top 5 Reasons why Employees are Losing Trust in their Leaders’ was published in Business Insider that stated that employees were leaving their posts because of bad leaders. Some leaders have good intentions and do what they think is best for employees, but they may not always have all the information to back up their decisions or may make decisions that are too big for their leadership positions. These leaders do not understand that their employees need time to solve problems as their leaders are not as familiar or as educated as they are and, therefore, cannot lead as effectively. Other times, a leader may know everything is great and that he/she is doing things right, without really knowing what the real reasons are as to why there should always be improvement. A leader should know the issues and concerns, the good, bad, or indifferent reasons for the problems and then take those to his employee(s). However"
361,How Do You Get A Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: How Do You Get A Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"For some people, like myself, this is a question that comes up often and requires a response, as it relates to the topic of virtual or online currency, Bitcoin.
To get a virtual, online or “virtual card” you would need to purchase something, then exchange that for Bitcoin in the market. Bitcoin is traded in markets, similar to stocks, so you could say that the value of bitcoins is determined by people buying them and selling them for other currencies and you as a bitcoin holder ‘own’ a slice of this value. To be a holder of bitcoin you need a wallet, to store your funds in. In my next article I will explain more about wallet and other key components. For those interested in more I highly recommend checking out www.bitcoin.org
This is probably the most popular way to get some virtual cash, if you don‘t want to or can‚t spend time in front of computers trading in your own currency. So where do you go to exchange your dollar bills? That site has a great deal of information about Bitcoin and is in many ways the go-to site for those new to virtual currency or even Bitcoin itself. If you are interested, I“ll include a link in this next post. I want this to be something that is helpful to others, and to answer the initial question as I have it. It isn„
tying it together

What I am about to say doesn‟t hold true for all virtual currencies, there are many more that have been created. Also as new currencies come online that will no longer work with the currency I listed above. The list is still growing and this could change. But if all goes as planned this will be the only currency that I discuss. This may sound like a cop out but I hope it‛s useful and at least a start point for people seeking to use virtual money, but don't know where to begin. Virtual currencies are a huge and growing field, some of which are more than a decade old and I plan to add new information and answers to old questions as they come in as well as the newer ones.‖

362,Where Can I Find A Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Where Can I Find A Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"It is either something the author would want to know or something you can answer. The former would require you to go to a website or search for that answer, while the latter requires you just to look at the sentence in question.

As you have just learned from the last task, it's important to be able to recognize these two types of questions in order to choose the right answers. This is especially important with complex questions, where there is more than one possible answer (like this one):
 
So how would you answer this?
There is no way in which we can know for sure. I'd go with the third choice of the questioner:
""The card is on the table on my desk. It will cost you $15 to get one.""
This is not the same thing as asking us for a recommendation or asking about the best place in our area. Instead, this is asking you if you know that you should buy a card on a specific day. You might have seen a sign advertising it (and that sign isn't going to work) or heard about it from someone else. So, we'll have to dig a little deeper to find out the answer:  

 If the date doesn't matter: The answer is easy. No, because we do not have an office to buy that card, so it is impossible for us to tell you how to acquire such a thing. If you would ask ""Where can I get a cheap virtual card?"", then the real answer would be that the cheapest price you could find one for is in an internet shop, not in your office or from a friend or colleague. In fact, the only way that we would know you didn't have a virtual credit card would if we saw some signs, or if our coworkers came to us and said ""I've heard that online shop X has a good deal for virtual cards!"".

 if the day does matter then it'll be a matter of finding the specific shop: We do know such shops, and we know which of them are the ones that specialize in virtual credits cards. We've just talked about this on this site, but it might be worth adding a comment."
363,Is There An Option To Have A Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Is There An Option To Have A Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This is a question that has been asked by the financial institutions many a time. The answer would be ‘yes”, there is an option to have a virtual card with the help of a third party.

In a nutshell: What Is A virtual Card
The concept of an electronic wallet/card/debit card/virtual card is something new to the world of finances. This has become a trend. But as to why it is so, is that there has come to an age where the physical wallets have been phased out. We are moving more towards the electronic version in almost every aspect of our lives. For example: In the past when you had your money with you or at the ATM, you would need a wallet to be able to transfer money, but now with a card you don’t need to carry a thing with it at all. And even if the card has to get lost for whatever reason, the bank will be in the loop, and you will get a chance to replace your card and continue. With the digital card there‘s no point in carrying a physical card if it isn‚Äôt getting used because you have an e- wallet with all of your details at your fingertips. You might be wondering: what is in a Card/Wallet? A wallet is basically a holder for your cards/money. They are usually made up of leather but these days they have started to change and now you can find card holders that are made of plastic. Card holders hold up to 15 cards, so you definitely need one to hold all your credit cards!
As you get into your teens, twenties, or thirties, credit card companies and the banks want to find better ways to keep track of you. Your card might just be an ID to you, that‟s all it does. To the outside world it means that you„ÖÇ£re a responsible person.ÊÓ It might show that your spending habits are controlled, making your financial well being a lot more stable. Credit cards will come with certain features that will allow the credit company to track your activity and monitor your usage. All this information will help them decide whether they can lend you more money. By using these cards you make it easy for the companies to access your bank accounts as you use them. There are certain things you should watch out for,"
364,If I Don'T Want A Physical Card Can I Get A Virtual Version?,Considering this utterance: If I Don'T Want A Physical Card Can I Get A Virtual Version? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it a positive or negative? This question can be answered with the following: The intent of the uttering of these words was to convey an opinion. This was an Opinion with some negative feeling about this opinion in a statement. If you were the listener and had a different opinion the statement above would have been in this form:
–
I Don't Like The Idea Of Card Printing. I think the best thing that can happen is to get a digital version.

This was then said with a negative opinion that has some feelings with it as well. The listener could also be in line with this idea because it sounds like it could be very beneficial. With this it can also convey the negative feelings about it. As I said before, there are many ways you can convey these feelings and the ones mentioned are some of them. Now the most important thing to note is that all these ideas are subjective to what you want from the card, whether it be for your business, or if you are a fan of a certain team. There is no right way, just the way that you find that works for you."

366,Can You Tell Me How To Order A Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Can You Tell Me How To Order A Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This might look like a simple request but it will have a more profound meaning and effect than you think. There is some hidden information in the question, and we shall look at it. The most important thing is to figure out the meaning that will help you solve the puzzle.
For starters, we will focus on a few key words that stand out as we look deeper. Let’s break this into a list of words and how they are used:

How, Can, Tell, A: These are very important words in this sentence. They are all part of the word “Can”, which is followed by the verb ‘Tell‘. This tells us that the person wants the information (of order) from other people. If you take the words apart you get: How can you tell, or How do you order a virtual card?, so you see that this statement is asking a lot of questions and wants to be answered in detail. As for ’Virtual Card“, that is referring to the virtual version of physical credit cards. When shopping online, one can be charged without ever touching a physical piece of plastic, this is how virtual cards are created. So, let‽s answer the first few questions. How, it‛s up to them, they have the right, to tell you, so ask them if they would like you to order their cards!
Can you Tell me how to? is another one. It is a very simple question that needs no response. But the other one will need a response, the response will be that they don‚t want to give you the details. Can is used as a way to say, ""Can"" + ""do"" = ""Cannot"" So you could say ""I can't eat that"" but if you asked a doctor or a dietician they may tell a person to ""eat that"". Can you? or Can‍t you?, is what we are asking, can they? If yes, then you can have their virtual or physical card! If no they might not want you asking that, but you have permission to ask because of ""You can"".
The verb ""to tell"" is ""tell"" and it means to speak about, give an opinion, share information or knowledge about something. We can tell someone how something is done, how it looks, what to expect"
367,Where Is The Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Where Is The Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Doesn't really tell me much. In fact it only tells me that there's something about virtual card that needs to be defined.
It doesn't tell whether there is or isn't something called a VirtualCard?"
368,What Is The Virtual Card,Considering this utterance: What Is The Virtual Card What is the intent that best describes it?,"The following list explains: the card, the list of things on the virtual card: and the things. It will also help you to identify the different virtual cards and virtual lists that you use in a presentation, so you will know when to use which one. For example: You are designing a virtual list for a company report. You want to create a list. The virtual things that go on this list: The report The list The company The card that represents these things is called the Virtual List.

The list can be virtual or paper. If you were to go to Microsoft Word and create the same list, you may have created the following: In the top right corner of the page you see the name of your virtual item. This is your list name. Your list has a name and a description. In this case, my list’s named “report” and it‘s description is: ‘A description of our company and its products, services, and customers“. I have two columns in my report: one for products and services and one column for customers. On the first of my columns, I list the products we offer and on my second column, list our customers and their contact information. My paper virtual report has the very same look to it. But my virtual version has more flexibility. With a paper report, if you need to add an item, then you have to find a piece of paper to write on for the item you want and then write it on. A virtual print is much nicer. When it comes to the ” what is a the‟ the and what„ the, this is where you find the power of virtual. Virtual is very powerful in that it can hold all of these types of items, but it allows for many more combinations of information than can ever be printed on paper in the real world. As mentioned, this section explains the four parts of a typical Virtual presentation. „The Card‣ What do I want this card to represent? When you are creating a card or when creating and adding items to a Card, a great way to get to know what you‚ve got is to first look at what card it is that is going to ‚be‛ the one you plan to deliver. To find out what virtual presentation card you might use for an upcoming project, it helps to ask:
What is it that I need this"
369,How Do I Get A Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Get A Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:
.
I believe that the sentence ""How do I get a virtual card?"" is not really a meaningful way to phrase this. If you are using an e-mail system like Gmail, and want to use your virtual mail address, it seems natural to ask 'How can I sign up for a Gmail address?'
If you want a Google account, I think your question is better phrased as 'Can I register a new email address for google?' If so, check google for 'Google Account Sign Up'
To signup for something specific, e.g. Gmail and not any form of google account: http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?answer=1861"

The intention of the person using the words: To ask questions about where they can get a virtual card?
To request a service from a provider? For example: If the user types: “Where can I get my virtual account for online payment?” then the most likely interpretation is to request the card’s provider.
Some other meaning that you think could be inferred? Or you‘ve not heard the utterances? Please leave a comment below."
371,Why Did I Not Get A Virtual Card Yet?,Considering this utterance: Why Did I Not Get A Virtual Card Yet? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This utter was sent to the author by an unknown, so we may never know its intent.
What I know from my own experience is that sometimes, people want a virtual card but do not realize that they do. It is not uncommon for people to feel like the virtual solution is a better way to do things but, in reality, their experience would probably be a bit faster to have an actual physical card because of things like:
- The person is used to doing something in a certain way
-- For example, when I got my iPhone 4S, it required me to set up my SIM in an unfamiliar way because I was used by other phones. I had to learn how to use it but it wasn't so difficult that I didn't have the phone for a couple days. Other times, the experience of using another device that is more ""advanced"" than yours takes a little more experience than you have. But if you do that right, you'll feel comfortable with it quickly.  
The same can be said for learning how physical cards work. The first time you use one, there is going to be some learning involved, but when you're done, that's it!"
372,How Can I Order Virtual Cards?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Order Virtual Cards? What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:
For me it is ""How can you order virtual cards""?
""How"" is not part of the main clause and so it's a question that does not belong to the predicate."

I'll tell you where to find your car keys, if you can just tell me what you're looking for?
(Source: https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/tell-where-find)
However, is there any other examples I could look into? I have tried to look up all of the definitions, but this one stands out because I am not sure if it should be used with this verb or not.   Can someone help me with the meaning of this? How would this be commonly used in the real world? And if I do use this, do you think I should include the verb in parentheses next to the sentence? Like so: ""Can you tell Me (Where) Where...""?
UPDATE (11/26/19):
This one in particular stood out to me: I'm trying to determine whether or it's grammatically incorrect to include a pronoun inside the clause in this case, and what would be the correct way to express something like: (In a way) You can (use it for) a certain thing. (For example, you (could) use it to talk to your parents.)
Thanks.
EDIT: The sentence was actually: You (can use) it (for) that
For Example:  You use (Can You) It (Use) to (Talk On Your Phone.) (Source https:/www.(google.pt/url?q=https:/(googleusercontent))
My main question is, how do I express this in an informal way, without ""you"" or ""can""?
If you have any ideas regarding the question, I would appreciate it. Thanks!
Note: the word ""to"" in ""You (do) what to"" was accidentally included in one of my comments, it was suppose to say ""I"" instead. Sorry about that. Thank you for letting me know
Also, to add to what I said below, the example sentence that I wrote down in a comment was incorrect. I meant to write this instead: It uses the same principle as a password, by using a long phrase that includes a random word/letter, in order for someone to unlock the account. It is just like how one would write a passphrase and use a key"

(I'm looking for a synonym to get a virtual card, which is ""A card that is in paper format, and that can be used at any place, or a code for using at some place."")

A:
{(1,0)[The best description is] Is it possible for me to [get a][use] a [virtual][card]]
The verb is get. It is a transitive verb, so the subject of a get sentence is either the speaker or the listener. In your example, the first subject is you. The second subject could refer to either you or your listener depending on the context. If you said, ""Can I get virtual money from the bank?"", it wouldn't make sense. You would need an object, like money, to say, for example ""I want money."" In this case, though, you are describing what you want to buy yourself, something you would use your credit card for, not your bank account."
375,Is This Where I Order A Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Is This Where I Order A Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"To ask for a card. This is a simple example. If you ask ""Is This where I order a virtual card"", the answer is no, it is not. It is asking for an order of what? The ""virtual card"". In this case, the question is better phrased:
If I ask, ""Can I give you a gift card?"" the response would be ""yes"".
In the above example you should be asking about a ""gift card"" which implies that you are asking that the person be able to receive some type of benefit from it.
Another example, I can say, 'Are you the boss?'. If I am asking if the other person is in charge of an organization, office, etc. I would ask: ""Are You the Boss?""
The above question does not imply you can give them the gift (gifts, cards, vouchers) of whatever they are in power for. However it may imply a certain respect for the one that they may or may not be, even though they could answer: yes, that is my boss, but only if he is present and answers. In the case of the ""boss"" they might not even have heard of a boss. 
So when you use a greeting card, do not ask if they can ""use"" or ""benefit"" from something, unless the card has instructions as to how they should use it, and it would then read: You can use this card as a way to tell someone that....
I hope this helps."

I could also have easily have given you the information to do it yourself. There is no free money here for anybody. This was a trick. I will not be doing these things to myself as I have a good credit score and do not need credit, but this was very interesting nevertheless. Is the meaning of this message true?

377,Help Me Obtain A Virtual Card,Considering this utterance: Help Me Obtain A Virtual Card What is the intent that best describes it?,"1.
This utterances is a statement of a request. This is because I'm asking you to help me obtain a card for my new phone. In other words, this request is for a specific action. The action I am seeking is ""a virtual card"", which means the ""card"" I requested is something I will obtain by doing nothing. I can use it to pay with my phone or use in other contexts. But there is nothing in this sentence to show the act of acquiring it. You could simply say ""A virtual credit card"" or ""An e-gift card"".
2.This is simply a general question (as in ""Can I have a virtual...""). The statement contains a verb but is not a command for something to be done. There is no action requested. It is only asking a question that may or may not be answered. ""Do you have an eGiftCard?"" ""I want an apple."" ""Why do you think you're in trouble?"".
3.I was wondering if you would accept this card. Here it's asking ""If you were going to accept the card, what would you do"". In addition to the question, you also have the word ""you"" in the sentence. So it is clear that someone is making the request here. (Someone may say something like ""Would you accept a gift card?"").
4. Help me get a credit for this purchase. Not really talking about anything specific but just saying that you can help him. He may get the credit by using it for himself and then giving it away to you. Or he may buy it and gift it himself."
378,Where Is The Virtual Card Located?,Considering this utterance: Where Is The Virtual Card Located? What is the intent that best describes it?,"To me, it is a question of semantics, of which there are many.  

A:
**(1) The virtual card does not exist and never did exist** (2) A card was never located at the location that it currently occupies**  (3) There is no card at a location.**
You can also say ""Where is my card?"" The answer being that there is nowhere. You can't be more precise than that."

I think this is a question from a native speaker of English who has not had much practice speaking English. This is very common in many countries where you see people speaking with a very thick accent. 
There is no rule for the best words to use. If you really have to know what it means, you can always ask your teacher or a teacher at an English language school or university where they teach English as a foreign language."
380,Where Do I Obtain My Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Where Do I Obtain My Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Does it express a general or a unique sentiment? A Sentiment Analysis can be useful in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including sentiment analysis, intent classification, information extraction etc. In this post, I want to give an introduction about SentiWordNet, a lexical database of English semantic features and sentiment lexicons. The goal of this database is to automatically analyze and tag text.

This database has three parts:
• Sentence level: Contains all the synonyms and their respective sentiment value. It is composed of two sections: general and personal. This part is used by itself, or in combination with others (e.g. a word can have different meanings and different sentiments).
The database contains 3,622,942 general synonym pairs: 2,814,734 positive and 708,118 negative. As you can see, each word has a sentiment polarity. Words like “funny” or ”happy“ have a positive sentiment, while words like‘sick’ have negative one. If a synset has the same sentiment of a given word, we say it‟s associated. Sentiments are computed for each syn-set and words. A general sentiment can also express an individual attitude. For example, if a person uses a computer daily, they could have the opposite opinion of someone who is just learning the language. We have 1,521,963 synponyms for the personal part. Each word in the dataset has different number of personal synsets and a number depends on the number in general part: there are a smaller number personal ones compared to the general. But even words with the ’same sentiment‚ have their own opinion for themselves, which may differ from how they express about others or their opinions about their personal life. Let„s analyze some positive words: „fear‛, ‚proud‌,›excited‹, and other‫ words such as happy, excited, proud, afraid.‬ We can extract the sentiments of ‹frightened‡ from the word ‘frown‏. When we do this, the sentiment will be positive. So, from all these positive sentiments, it is more likely than not that they have positive opinions for other things. You can easily tell the difference between the"
381,I Want A Virtual Card!,Considering this utterance: I Want A Virtual Card! What is the intent that best describes it?,"You have to be careful of using verbs like “want” with ‘VirtualCard’,‘RealCard
A VirtualCard, by it‟s nature is not a real thing. Therefore, we can„t really
want it!.
It‚s not something that you can hold in your hands or touch. You can only view it with
your eyes.
So, I really want a Virtualcard!. I“d love a virtual card!. That‰s all I want. It›s like
wanting a million dollars, or a car or even wanting a date. There is no action involved. We
simply say, „I want it!‹
But a RealCard! is something you have a physical possession of. A RealCardo is like a
physical wallet. And when you want one, you are saying you would like it to get it in the
future; for example, if you don‛t have some money for gas, and then you get in a situation
in which you need gas. So, in that sense, it is very similar to a credit or checking card. But
it has more meaning than just a wallet or card because when we want to buy things on
line, for instance, with a card, all you do is swipe it and pay. With a ”Virtual Card you
must be online. All you must do when making a purchase is to input a code. The Virtual
Card stores the virtual money in our account instead of the actual money. Thus, the card
does provide us the ability to purchase something in online but it doesn‖t provide real money
until it gets into that account and the money comes out."
382,I Want One Of Those Virtual Cards!,Considering this utterance: I Want One Of Those Virtual Cards! What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:
We know the phrase and we know what people normally mean, so the most reasonable explanation is: “I want to buy an item which has some special characteristics.”
This sentence has a few parts: the verb phrase, the noun phrase (one of those virtual cards) and the adjectival phrase. The verb is ‘want’ and this is a common verb in the UK.
The noun is one of, as in ” I want one. I do not want a different one“. In this case, that virtual card is being used for a single purpose. If it was a more flexible card, one which you could use for multiple tasks, then there would be no need for one in particular. For example, if the player were to have a card that allowed them to walk and run at the same time then this card can be used to run for 5 seconds and then walk for 30 seconds. Thus the card would need to be more generic to use in different situations."
383,Are Virtual Cards Available To Get?,Considering this utterance: Are Virtual Cards Available To Get? What is the intent that best describes it?,"To ask whether virtual cards are available for people to get?To inquire what the purpose of the virtual card system is. OrTo request more information about the card.
This utterances may be used to indicate different meanings to a user based on context or on the users' intentions. For example, a virtual bank account is a type of card in which the user deposits money and withdraws from it as desired. The user is not required to pay any fee, and it is completely free to use this type. On the other hand, the online shopping is similar to the cash card except the shopping can be done from the comfort of your home or while you are on vacation. Both types may require additional fees but they are still free of charge. However, in a real life environment, this kind of virtual money may not be a card, but merely a gift. You may use it at a bank ATM machine, etc."
384,Can You Help Me Sign Up For A Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Can You Help Me Sign Up For A Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The first thing that I can assume is that the person who wrote this is trying to make a purchase. Maybe he's looking to get a virtual card? Is this correct? Why wouldn't one want to purchase a real-life virtual credit card that's used online for purchases? What are its benefits? For instance, if you want the card to help you make purchases at a specific website that requires a certain type of card, you won't need to worry about finding the virtual version of the credit or debit card. Or, what if your card is lost or stolen? With a regular card there's nothing you can do except report it and hope a replacement card will be issued and it arrives quickly. But with a cyber card you don't have to wait for a physical replacement, which may never be given that some of these cards are not issued with an expiration date.
[url=http://www.cybercardinfo.com]virtual credit[/url]
With a traditional physical card people have a limited time window or a specified time frame to report a lost/incomplete card before it is reported invalid, the account will no longer be accepted, or the company will suspend the transaction. Virtual cards seem to have no time limit, so if a card were to be stolen and then reported it could be used forever. So the potential benefits of using a credit/debit card online include:
No expiration dates - virtual cards can be extended indefinitely. You may find this a good or bad thing, depending on your particular circumstances. For example, say you lose your credit cards but find a new card and use it online, then it will eventually expire. If you're a frequent online-spender, this could mean that you'll have lost money by the time the current account is cancelled. There may be a way to cancel online transactions but it's not really a very convenient way, as the transactions are still ongoing and can't be undone. A virtual account can also be ""extended"" indefinitely, even after the original account expires, giving you the chance to continue to spend your money in a secure, virtual fashion. [url=-cyb

385,Can I Get A Copy Of The Card By Email?,Considering this utterance: Can I Get A Copy Of The Card By Email? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it:

To receive an immediate, complete and detailed invoice or statement for goods or services purchased
or received?
For example, when you have just ordered some flowers
for delivery in a certain month or at a particular location.
You want to receive them by mail, and you would like to have them mailed to your home,
because that is where you will be when they are delivered. The person
who delivers the flowers may also print an invoice/statement from the system. In this case, you can say: ""Please give me a copy of the card by email"".
It is up to you to decide: if you want the printed invoice and card, or only a quick email of that invoice. There is not necessarily a right or wrong answer to this question. It all depends on what you do with that card that will tell you what kind of transaction is happening."
386,Where Do I Find The Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Where Do I Find The Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"You can read our articles on this topic by just clicking on the title of the article. If you want to go straight to the section on virtual cards, use the link at the bottom. But to understand the topic you’ll read here, you have a choice.

The way to find the virtual card is just as simple as finding the real world card. That is, if the person making the utterances knows where it is. This is a very complex part of this article, one of a kind. So if you are the type that would rather have your questions answered in a more direct way, read on. Otherwise, just read the headline. You will find it just below this paragraph. It has nothing to do with the question you might have about virtual currency or how it works. Just keep reading because there are many questions here. All you do is keep scrolling down. And, while at it, I bet you wouldn”t be here if there weren“t a reason. Okay? Okay. Let‘s get started. I will provide you a virtual address with that virtual account. The virtual location and virtual street address that you need to send your virtual money to. Yes, that is right. When you buy something in real life with real money, the merchant is expected to give you the physical location at which you can find that object. Now, for virtual currencies, there is no physical card that one gets when making a purchase. There are virtual locations where you find all of your coins and bills. They are called virtual wallets. These are where your digital money is found. In other words, we are going to show you how to locate the card you get when you spend coins. We are using the term “find‖‚ to indicate that the user must know the specific physical address for the coins or bills stored inside a particular wallet. Because all virtual accounts have these locations, all you must do when buying something online is to enter the name of that card into the box you would put down to ” ‘buy something‏.„¦ That‟s all there‰s to finding virtual coins stored in virtual banks. Once you enter a name for that type of virtual wallet, a web site will tell you whether or not you qualify for their"
387,Why Do I Not Have A Virtual Card,Considering this utterance: Why Do I Not Have A Virtual Card What is the intent that best describes it?,"I think its a rhetorical question with an implied answer and the reader/listener is expected to infer the meaning from what is written.
But what does ""why do I not have a virtual card?"" mean? How can one not know the answer to this? Is the implied meaning ""Why can/do I/you not do X""?

A:
You should be able to see if it is rhetorical by finding it in a style guide (like the Chicago Manual of Style or the AP Stylebooks)."
388,How Do I Order A Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Order A Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"A
virtual card is one that is created for the purpose of obtaining
cash.
In addition, you must know that this definition, although accurate
on the surface, can be misleading. This is because the term virtual
can also refer to software and the hardware to run the software that
you can get from your credit card companies for a small charge. In
addition, it can also mean a credit or debit card that you buy from
a third party. The point is, what you want depends on what type of
card you are looking for and what your goals are. You must remember
that the terms virtual card and counterfeit card are synonymous. A
counterfeit card could either be a fake card with the same numbers
from your real card but that has none of the security features of a
real card such as chips, holograms and security threads. Or it could
be a card made with a stolen account number. If you do not know
what you really want, then you will not be able to find the best
solution, nor the one with best features and benefits. It is very
similar to shopping for clothes for yourself. For example, in your
clothes closet, there are some clothes that are made for you and some
for others. When you shop for others, for example your children,
their clothing is made in a different way than what is available in
your clothing closet. Thus, the question to ask yourself before
going online and purchasing a virtual or a counterfeit is how do I
want it to be. Let’s take a look at some virtual cards to see
options available. How

credit card comes in many sizes. However, they are all designed to
give you the benefits needed to make your life easier and more
efficient. First, if you need a way to quickly access your funds
online, and you also need to spend your money, a personal virtual credit
is the card for your needs. Second, because you use a software
program to access this virtual form of card, your transactions will be
secure and private. Thirdly, with this type card you can have any

391,Can I Order A Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Can I Order A Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"A) I can order a card.   B) It is possible I buy a virtual card?

What is it that really separates a) and b)? Does it sound like it has something to do with an actual physical card and whether or not it can be used? Or does it have more to it than that? I've always taken it to mean that it is an online transaction so there is no actual card or paper used. But that doesn't seem to be the case when it comes to buying things online.
So what is actually going on here? A virtual physical transaction? How does that work? What does the transaction even look like in a case of buying something online? In the past I have thought that a transaction is complete when someone hands you a slip of paper and you sign it but then when I read that people have been doing this for many years before the concept of a paper slip existed at all it started to make a lot more sense to me. I still am not entirely clear on what the deal is here. And I am curious about the differences between the different types of online transactions. There doesn’t seem like much of one as far as the technology involved, but it seems like there are many different kinds. It‘s not an easy question to search for either. So I thought I would ask here and see if there„s anything out there. Or if not, maybe you all can enlighten me! Thanks very much. -Bryan
P.S. Please excuse my spelling since English isn‚t my first language. If something is misspelled, then it doesn""t mean anything so forgive me :)  Thank you!
Edit:
I have tried searching for the word and for ""virtual card"", etc., etc. but I don“t think it”s a very well defined term or any clear distinction. All the search results are pretty much about virtual money, virtual credit cards, buying virtual items, etcetera. Which I think is part of the problem with the question.

392,Where Can I Go To Get A Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Where Can I Go To Get A Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This utterances may be of different types:
a) to seek help;b) request information;c) ask for directions.
To analyze the different intent types, we will apply the “Rule of Thirds”, which states the uttering person (in this case, you) is likely to have three different intents: Seeking Help- Seeking Information- Requesting Directions
The main difference of this exercise is: you must use your own judgement about which intent best fits your utter sentence. If you believe that the best fit is ‘Seeking Help’, then write an example sentence as below: 
Where can I go to get a Virtual card? Where can i find some information? Please, can you recommend a website that provides some good information about Virtual cards?"

394,I Would Like A Virtual Card- Where Can I Purchase One?,Considering this utterance: I Would Like A Virtual Card- Where Can I Purchase One? What is the intent that best describes it?,"In this case, I would think that we would want to make sure that our audience can see that the writer is attempting to provide a good experience, and that he/she is offering a service that is useful to the reader. I think the word I prefer in this context is ‘reliable.’
(I do realize that there are many other synonyms for this particular phrase. For example: reliable, stable, dependable.)
But this is one way to think about this kind of expression.
And if we are talking about a writer or a product, it is very helpful for us to consider these words. We may want the same kind/amount of experience as others reading our work or use of our products. That may mean that, in some instances, we must make a point to be reliable and/or stable (at some level.) This can be very difficult to do – especially if you are a perfectionist. (See below for another example.) But, on the other hand, if one is an entrepreneur, or in business, one may be more confident in the fact that it can‘t get much better than what one has to deal with every day. The point is that reliability and stability are always in demand. And, as you know – this type of reliability is not so easy to achieve in all situations. Especially if the situation involves a change that might affect your own situation. But I digress. My point in including this line of thinking about the “Intent” behind the phrase, ”…where can I purchase one?,“ is to help us recognize that such a statement is a great way of getting readers to see what they may not see in a situation and a way in which they can get a better „feel‟ for what the author is providing, what it may or may NOT be. There are different reasons why an author might want a virtual card, but in general, they are all related to a desire to share something. If, however, the point behind this expression is simply to ‚‚…provide value‛, then this phrase may work for some people, though not others. You might have to experiment to find out what works best, both in content, style, tone, voice(s), etc. for your type situation.(And here is another way one can"
395,When Should I Receive My Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: When Should I Receive My Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The best answer to that question is: ""I am requesting that I be allowed to receive my Virtual Wallet Card and be issued an address, or have one issued for me.""

The problem with this is that it is not a direct request. A true request must clearly convey the intention or purpose of the desired action to a human being. An example of a request to allow me to access information is ""Please give me access to information on my account."" To receive an account, one would have to ask ""When can I receive information regarding my wallet?""
In this case, there is ambiguity as to what the purpose is of asking for information. When the user is asking to be provided with information, it can reasonably be understood to mean requesting the information in the future, not immediately. The user has not yet received anything. It would be reasonable to presume that the first time the card is provided is when the account is activated (in which case there would not be anything to provide).
If the request were for the wallet to immediately be able to perform certain functions, the language would need to clearly say so such as:
""When should I start receiving money?"" - In case it should happen that there are multiple transactions from the initial user to the recipient.
Note, that even though ""when"" is present, a ""now or never"" answer is still appropriate to these questions. They are more about the state of affairs now than the time in future when they will occur. So, for example, if a user asked ""Are you done sending me money?"", it would clearly imply something about immediate action and would therefore be a poor request because it could take a lot of time to reach the destination (it could be anywhere in cyberspace). However, ""Send me 10 cents to my card immediately"", would make it clear that they want to see 10¢ today. However if the response were ""You will get the money in 3 months time"", it does not clarify whether that is in days or months, nor does it make that clear what happens if I do not pay the sender in time."

(1) ""Is there a possibility to have a virtual card?"".
Or (2)  ""Can I have one? or, How can I get a Virtual
card?"". Or even (3) Is that possible that there already is a card that can be virtual, and that nobody knows
about it?"". (I am not a native English speaker, but is (1), (a), or (b) more likely? I can think about it, if (c) is
possible, can you please tell us if you have some explanation that I am misinterpreting the question or something?)
Thank you very much for the support!
Have a nice day.
EDIT: I would really prefer that this question is more of a grammar question rather than a vocabulary question, because I believe that in most cases the meaning of the message is clear (that is, I think that people with English as a second language have the capacity to understand messages without needing to know a certain vocabulary). That is why I did not add a list with more words to explain my thoughts, which would just be the same thing in the different languages (for example: ""A virtual credit card is like a real one, except that it may be impossible to spend money with them or to buy stuff""). And it would be easier to do that if the language of communication is known (the vocabulary and grammar). The idea I had was to add an article: a or the, to specify the word of ""a virtual"" (as I already explained). However, this article does not work, as this way of explaining the idea was already in existence. I apologize for adding something that already exists. If you feel more comfortable, please let me know in which part of my explanation is where I use the wrong words. Thank you. It is very helpful to me to learn something in order to improve my English, although I feel like an English expert. :)

Can we use it for anything at any place, any time and anywhere? Is the phrase used for an all-purpose, universal or an unlimited? And how do we understand this question in an appropriate manner?

403,It Will Be Fine To Use At Any Establishment That Accepts Mastercard.,Considering this utterance: It Will Be Fine To Use At Any Establishment That Accepts Mastercard. What is the intent that best describes it?,"The intent of this is that one should be able to use the Visa debit card at any place that accepts Master Card, because one will have the card and its benefits (e.g. the ability to obtain discounts, pay less for service etc.) without actually possessing the Master card. In this sense, it is a lie, since the actual Master will not be possessed, although it can be presented as if it were. So, to be clear, one's statement is: “…and since I am a MasterCard holder, I can use it, and since you accept Master Credit cards you will be fine using it.”
I am looking for a clear answer that can describe the difference between these two statements, or an explanation for why they are not the same.  I suspect that in this context there are two different senses. One, that if I have a credit card, there is nothing wrong in using a specific brand, rather than another, e. g. ‘…the Master’s of ’em,‘ and I will still be okay to do business…, etc., and two, ”…but you should not use anything but Visa“.
In the first case, then the statement implies I need this Visa to pay my bills on time, which I do not think is true; I do not have  ‏(need) a ‐Visa card for this. If the second case was the intention, though, this would imply that „Mastercard‖ should only be used where one can purchase something with it (in terms of the business model of that business). Since we are talking about businesses and transactions, would this not imply a different type than that of a Visa card? But if this second meaning is present, why use both words, Master and Visa? Wouldn't it be simply better to just use Visa, as Visa is already a trademark, while Master is not? And what is meant by this sentence:
„I can easily tell a person‚s income and status of one‟s bank account, if they have one in the country, by simply observing their credit cards. Mastercards are issued by banks, so they all have them. I use my Master to tell what a man‰'s status is, what kind of house he"

There is a general idea of using cards for sending greetings but it is used in a broad sense. E. To put a design on a particular card for a specific person is called the use of greeting cards."
405,Can My Card Be Used Everywhere?,Considering this utterance: Can My Card Be Used Everywhere? What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:
There are a couple of ways to interpret this sentence.  My intuition is that it is a statement of opinion, so it can be interpreted as a question.
You can make a different claim, though: You can interpret the entire first half as an attempt to get someone else to agree with your opinion. It works the same way if you use the question form of the verb, asking for someone to ""agree"".
For the second half, ""everywhere"" suggests something that is always applicable. So it makes sense the first part is meant to be read as: ""Everywhere that they're not using it,..."" The first ""that"" means ""for all that"", which seems to suggest that the card is usable everywhere (in comparison to the places I'm thinking of).  You might think of that as being a kind of general statement, like ""The card works everywhere it's used""."
406,Are There Any Limits On Where I Can Use My Card?,Considering this utterance: Are There Any Limits On Where I Can Use My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Can you tell how the author might feel in response to this particular situation? Why? In the context of the passage, would this response be surprising? Would you expect an agent to be happy when a customer chooses not to buy something?

Answer: This is an incomplete and incorrect answer. You should explain that it is incomplete by explaining the reason why. I would add a sentence like ""There is, therefore, some reason for saying X, but there is also another reason that explains why you may also say Y."" You do not necessarily need to mention both reasons in your answer; simply state that the sentence is not complete. In this case, the two reasons that can explain why the agent might be disappointed are that (1) the customer has not bought anything, which is something the bank does not like, and (2) in this situation, it was clear that he would like to sell his card. These are the only two possible reasons, in my opinion. The first reason has more support than the second. For that first option, if the person does buy anything then there will be no issue. Also, this would be true in general. It is normal for banks to want to make some money even if people do nothing - it keeps the business going in an economical way. As for the option of disappointment because they want customers to choose to use their credit, I"
407,What Stores Can I Sue My Card?,Considering this utterance: What Stores Can I Sue My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"In this case, the cardholder has a complaint about a merchandise or service that she obtained. The merchant or his agent has failed to deliver the product, and the customer would like to sue in Small Claims Court to enforce a right to compensation for the damages incurred.

However, there is a potential obstacle in suing in small claims court. This is because the rules for filing a claim in a court of law are different when they apply to a civil action in which the amount at issue is less than $5,000. If the matter is more complicated and is over $3,500, or even more than that, you might want to consider a lawsuit filed in Superior Court. These rules are:
1. An attorney who appears for a person in civil court must have a law license;
2. A party may not appeal on the ground that the court’s decision was against the weight of the evidence; 3. When filing suit in the Superior Courts, a plaintiff shall file an affidavit stating when, why and how he/she believes his/her claim is supported by the law. 4. To be considered valid, an appeal bond must be paid to the defendant within 30 days; 5. Superior court rules require that a petition be filed with the Clerk of Court within six months after entry of judgment; 6. There is no limit on filing additional papers in support of a motion for summary judgment, although, such papers must support a party‘s motion; 7. Summary judgment shall only be granted if there are no material facts in dispute and where one or more claims are undisputed that entitle them to some kind of relief. (For more on these issues, see the section: When is it appropriate to File Civil Lawsuits?)
8. In smallclaims, if a case is not disposed of or settled after 60 days, it is terminated automatically, whether an order of dismissal has been entered or not. 9. Appeal in cases in superior court require written notice of appeal as to every party, as well as a transcript of court proceedings. 10. Appeals in court are heard by a panel of 3 (Superior Court) or 5 (Civil Court, Juvenile and Small claims) justices. 11. Each party shall be entitled to be represented by an attorney in any court action, unless the small claim plaintiff is appearing pro se; 12. No judgment for more that $500 can be appealed"
408,Can I Use My Card Anywhere I Want?,Considering this utterance: Can I Use My Card Anywhere I Want? What is the intent that best describes it?,"(Please choose only one of the following options)

1. To find out if I can use my credit card where I want to use it (to make payment).
2. I need to know where to find information about the places at which my card is accepted.
3. This place is a place where you can pay for services with a card."
409,Is There Anywhere My Card Will Not Be Accepted?,Considering this utterance: Is There Anywhere My Card Will Not Be Accepted? What is the intent that best describes it?,"How does the speaker wish to be perceived? What are some of the implications of that intent?

This is a very specific, almost-wordy answer. It takes a few sentences. The intent is to make the audience feel good, to put the listeners in a good mood and to leave them with a sense of satisfaction. This is not the sort of answer that makes sense in just one or two lines.


""I don't know whether there's anywhere that my card will not be accepted"" is an example of ""humorous sarcasm."" You're using a type of humor that is meant to convey a meaning different than the obvious literal interpretation. When sarcasms are used to create laughter in the right context, they are called ""funny jokes,"" not ""sarcastic remarks."" They are usually not literal statements, nor are they meant sarcastically.
In fact, there probably isn't a literal truth in most jokes. They aren't meant just to express the opposite of what actually happened. So, when someone is being sarcastic, the person saying it doesn't mean the literal opposite, such as ""I said you shouldn't have taken the car."" It's a way to imply the actual opposite. In this case, it's to say, ""You should have been happy that I didn't take the money."""
410,What Are The Rules To Where I Can Use My Card?,Considering this utterance: What Are The Rules To Where I Can Use My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"A. To get a refund for an order made with a gift card.
B. Not to get refunded for anything. (What I think happened was the company decided to change their terms, and I did not agree to the new terms so I asked if I could have my money back for items I had ordered).
Is part A correct as it relates to ""What Are the Rules to Use my Gift Card"" or is A wrong? I really don't know how else I should phrase it so that I'm not wrong. I just know there is something that isn't right because I didn't get my refund I was expecting. Thanks for your help! 
P.S This site is what I used to read the rules in the first place.   http://m.ebay.com/help/merchant/account_recovery.html  and on their site it states: ""If your gift/Visa card has not been used within 30 days, you can get the funds back from the last purchase. ""  If they are saying I can use it for a purchase then I need to use what is listed in A as that doesn't happen. However I have used the card since the 30 day thing and have never used it in that manner. Is this why I am not getting a full refund from them?  I do not remember the date when I received my card, it was at least 1 year ago. And I also did receive a receipt showing I redeemed it. But I never got the cash back of $100 that was listed as the amount I get when you use your card as a method of payment for any purchase (if I remembered right).  So is this what's going on? Or am I misunderstanding something? Please let me know if there's more info I left out to clarify my question. THANKS!

411,Do You Know Where My Card Will Be Accepted?,Considering this utterance: Do You Know Where My Card Will Be Accepted? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is this statement: My wife will be in the hospital all day today (and the rest of the week)
The intent of this is clearly a request to the listener to find out what the current situation is for my wife, or to get some information about her condition and treatment.
I believe this last statement would also be correct. 
Am I right in my analysis? Thank you. :)

A:
[This is one of those questions which has been asked many many times before. It is not really worth spending a lot of time answering.]"
412,What Places Can I Use My Card?,Considering this utterance: What Places Can I Use My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Intent:
This utterances represents a thought, an action, and a feeling: A thought of: I want to use my card at a place. An action of getting an item and putting it in my car. A feeling of wanting to go on vacation.
It does not represent an answer to a direct question. There are many possible interpretations to the utterings: Why are you asking me this? I was not aware you used your card yet. I am happy for you! How do you know that you can use your credit card? Why do I need to tell you that? What are the other places that will accept my charge card. These are all different types of questions you could be asking. And they all are possible answers that a native could understand. However the answer that I believe best fits the question is: what? This question does indeed not have a specific answer. It is a question without an end result. So there is no need for a subject or object. The question has no object or subject at all. This uttering is more complex than most other utterences that we have seen up to this point in the conversation. To understand what this sentence is saying we are left with two options: Interpret the sentence by the use of words and phrases that match the context of what is happening in life. Or we could choose to look at the meaning of the words in this phrase. We can not only find the word “what” in that sentence, but we can find many of them. Including the ones that are highlighted in red. For example: ‘What are your plans?’, ’What can we do?', ” what do they? what will they‘, etc. Now the challenge that many people face when analyzing utterancies and utterence phrases like this is that the more words you read, the less you understand the message. How much more easier it is to just read the few highlighted words, to understand all of this at once. „
Now that these sentences are written, they make sense in English. When we look back at our other language phrases we see this same challenge. Take for example, this one: Quel lugar puede usar mi tarjeta de crédito.? Which can be translated to: Where can I use the card for? Or ‚What places can you use‛"
413,Is My Card Accepted Everywhere?,Considering this utterance: Is My Card Accepted Everywhere? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it an attempt to get an answer as quickly as possible, or is there any deeper meaning?

Is it a statement of fact, a request for confirmation, an inquiry, perhaps even a question? In order to find out, ask yourself if you have heard the statement before – it could be that your subconscious mind has registered it.
This article will help you with such questions and more. It will also help with your understanding of the Universal Laws – a key to understanding the way your mind works. You may not realise this, but when a thought or statement is uttered, it triggers a series of physical, emotional, mental and spiritual reactions in you. Understanding what happens in these reactions can help us to become more attuned to our subconscious and make use of these natural abilities. If we do this we will be able to change the thoughts that run continuously through our minds. We will have a better understanding and use this information to make better choices. This is especially important for people who have made bad choices in the past and are now paying the consequences. The Law Of Attraction is also very important to understand. Knowing how this Law works can be useful when you realise how your thought processes work, allowing you to use it in a positive way. A good understanding also helps you in finding better alternatives, because you will then have the choice between the right one and the wrong one. That is why a good awareness of your choices works to your advantage. When you make bad ones, the negative consequences will follow and you should be willing to take responsibility for them. So, if a particular decision can lead to a negative consequence, you must ask, “How can I avoid this?” or ” Is there another way? ‘
So, to answer your question, there are several possible interpretations of that statement. Here are a few:"
414,What Places Will Accept My Card For Payment?,Considering this utterance: What Places Will Accept My Card For Payment? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What are the possible actions that can be taken by the cardholder? (e.g., ""I am going to pay a bill"")

For the 1st example, it says:
I do not know, but I can guess it means: ""What places do you use to
buy stuff?"".
The answer: Most of the time, the places you go to buy stuff are: 1)
Pharmacies, and 2) Grocery stores.
This would make most sense. However, if I were using the verb pay,
and not the noun place, I would most likely think the answer would
be: I do pay some bills by writing checks. (not sure, maybe this is
not correct?)
In the case of: How would you like to be paid? the first verb
(how), is most of time referring to an action, whereas, in the
example given I think pay is an object? What does that verb mean? I
am not sure if it would be: how would I like the check to make out
or: what check would it be? 
As a side issue, what would your thoughts be if a native speaker asked you that question? For the latter example is this: Would you pay that bill by using a check? or How could I be most easily paid (the latter sentence would not be the correct phrase)?
Any help would greatly appreciated!
Thanks in advance.

415,Does This Card Work Everywhere?,Considering this utterance: Does This Card Work Everywhere? What is the intent that best describes it?,"1) I think it’s a “play it or lose it strategy” to keep the top two players from having a good game.
If you don‘t play it, one of the others can beat you. If you do play, they have to play for a win. (2)
2, or I„m not sure I understand it. This is a card which does not have an explicit effect if played, but can only be played to prevent a player from taking their turn. Is it more like „this is not allowed if you play this card“, ‟this must not be done‛ or ′this card will only work on me, if I use it I am the winner‚? (3) This sentence is unclear. It is ‚If I don´t keep track of it in a game, it is only to see who won this game‹, then it would be a question of (1), but I feel it does something more (it prevents a better game for those who would not play cards).
I´m sure somebody would say I was crazy or that I understood nothing, and this is true. I do not understand how to read this and what it means. Please, help me in order to understand this. Thanks. Sorry for my English (in spanish it looks much better). (4) If we understand ‹this› in this context as a strategy to have a bad game against one opponent, what is it called? In spain, we say, for example, that someone plays the black in ‘Pino-chino‟; in English, this means, you know, playing a black hand in Chinese Poker (the other person has only two cards, the reds, so he must either win or get the bad hand). This strategy, when it works in Pino, is called the ‬black out.‭ Is ‖ this ”‬ strategy called by the name of its most common application? Or is this just ‒ what the person wants to do‖, not something that is played? I would like the latter. So, in the example I mentioned we have ″If the player keeps track and sees that the other player has the two black, he will win″. †The strategy that works for me"
416,What Businesses Accept This Card?,Considering this utterance: What Businesses Accept This Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Do you feel the business accepts the customer card for the purpose of providing goods or services? Or do you think the company provides the product because the card is accepted at their business?

The intent of the Business that accepts a customer or member card can be described by the following statements:
- to provide goods
– to earn a reward
 – to encourage a purchase of their goods/services
.
I will explain the benefits and disadvantages of each statement. These statements are based on the way that I look at business that accept a card. If your business fits into one of these descriptions, the chances are good that people may consider this a business. This is not to say everyone will consider your card accepting business, but if you can describe your intent in such a way as in the example, I think you will get more customers. So, in this case for a clothing company I will use clothing as an example but the same concepts can apply to any company providing a product or service. We will call a company that describes that their intent is to “provide” as a Provider. Companies that describe their purpose to be to get a return on ‘“earmark’ or reward are called Rewarders. In this article, a Reward is defined as monetary. A monetary reward is a benefit that the consumer receives to make the transaction worthwhile. For example: a $100.00 gift card may be considered a monetary award to the merchant by consumers who purchase items with it. As a merchant, you do not want to limit your customer base by limiting the number of reward cards that your store will accept. That will hurt you in a number ways: - it could mean fewer customers, - the people who do purchase will be a smaller percentage of your total customers who shop your shop. - people that have cards and have not used them to purchase in other stores may never do business with you – it is all about building up your base of happy customers that will buy from you. – If you are a non-profit or charity organization you may only qualify to participate in reward programs for memberships or donations. There are many benefits to accept rewards, however, it will not happen if there are limitations on how many rewards are issued. The business will need to take action and issue their own rewards cards, if this is how they would prefer to work with merchants. To avoid the above drawbacks, rewarders"
417,Where Can I Use My Card?,Considering this utterance: Where Can I Use My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What are some ways that we can use this card?

I think the card should be the main tool to get people to the place where they can learn about how to use their card.
A good example of this is in the section called The Best Buy card, the text for
The BestBuy Card. This says what it gives you, who to call, etc. Also, it is a good
example of the kind of sentence we want to write in our cards. It gives
the information in a few lines. A better example would be to put the best
buy card on a sign that says ""Where can you use your bestbuy? (It is at Target)""
This makes the point clear, and also tells people that you want them to come
to the same place as you. The sentence is concise, so people can remember
it easily. Notice that they use the term ""TheBestBuyCard"", so
we want our own cards to say ""I Am Your Best
Buy Credit Card"".
Best Buy's sentence: ""When you are in need of something and want
a quick answer to 'Can I help you?, just ask a BestBu
y employee where to find your credit card.""
""When it comes to using your Bestbuy credit
card, you can also check your Balance and
Review your Purchase history."" This sentence shows
what each card can do, how it can be helpful. If we don't do a very good job with this kind
of sentence, we will have difficulty getting people's attention, as we might get some people
who don’t believe they need the info on their Best-buy Card, because it doesn't
appear in their daily lives. So we have to be sure to make a sentence that
gives the right information, that will draw people in. There should always be
several ways to do this. When people read a card they know that it has the
information they want, but if they are not sure then it will be harder for them
remember what they wanted, or they may just look elsewhere. We have an
overly complicated sentence here: (1) (2)
1. ""Can you help me find what I'm looking for? 2. How can I
use my Best Bu
ey credit c
ard? 3. Where can
people use
they"
418,Which Outlets Accept My Card?,Considering this utterance: Which Outlets Accept My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"In this example, the first sentence (the main sentence) makes sense grammatically, however, it does not seem to say much of a thing. This is not a problem of meaning. Rather, this may be a result of the way this sentence was written.
If you rephrase this paragraph to use the same words in an entirely different order, you will find that your message will get a far better response by saying what you truly mean instead of what may have been implied in the original. You just have to re-organize the wording and use more concise expressions."
419,"I Am Traveling To Germany, Will I Be Able To Use My Card There?","Considering this utterance: I Am Traveling To Germany, Will I Be Able To Use My Card There? What is the intent that best describes it?","It's pretty simple but not so easy as one can think. Is it to say ""I am traveling to Germany and I want to know if I'll be able to use my card to buy items there"". Yes is probably the first way you'd answer this question.

However, I also feel like:
It's to be like if you were going to the States to visit friends and your friends are there but there're a lot of people and everyone is looking at your card, that's why I ask because it says ""Germany"" on it and you don't know where the heck is Germany is. (I don´t know why)
So, which sentence is closer to my thoughts? Is there another way to answer it or you can just answer like it's the second example and let it be. This is for my own reference to learn more on this thing. :)
Thank you!
PS: There's a little edit. There was a line that says: Is your first name written on your identity card or not. I don' t know how to change that. If you know, let me know too. Thank you. 
[Edit: After some research, it seems that the right one is #2 because #1 is too vague for that.]
Another thing, is there any website to translate it from English to English? :) Just wondering. Or maybe you guys just do it yourself? (Not really asking for it, don’t mind if it is answered by you).
Thanks!   (sorry for the long post.)
Note: This question is not related to anything except a curiosity that I have for this matter. Also, my apologies as I'm not a native speaker. Hope you understand! :)"
420,What Stores Will Take My Credit Card As Payment?,Considering this utterance: What Stores Will Take My Credit Card As Payment? What is the intent that best describes it?,"To be clear, “What Stores“ is a common, easy to say, but easy also to misinterpret. It’s a simple two worded sentence but the second word ‘as” is often not given much thought.
It‘s as easy as ” I have $10 at a store. Is it OK to use my credit card there?„ or „I have a ten dollar bill from that store? ‚
The ‐as word is important in this sentence. A sentence that ends in a preposition ‑as is sometimes called a ‏‚prepositional phrase. Prepositions are words that join a noun and a verb. As you can see below, there is only one preposition and it is in the middle, or between the noun. But it can be as difficult to parse out as this, what is as simple as the above. Let›s take a closer look…
What stores will accept my card? (preposition is between ’as and the ‗the card)
Is it as good as cash for a credit or debit card. (what is †the answer)"
421,Is There Any Place I Cannot Use My Card?,Considering this utterance: Is There Any Place I Cannot Use My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is There No Place My Bank Account Will Not Take My Credit Card, Debit Card or Cash? Is the person saying that they are unable to use these items on all the places? Or that there are certain places that are not accessible through them? Are there places to which the bank account cannot send the funds to, even if the account is open? Does the statement indicate that the writer is unable of sending any funds?"
422,Will I Be Able To Use My Card Anywhere?,Considering this utterance: Will I Be Able To Use My Card Anywhere? What is the intent that best describes it?,"And what is its meaning and what does it all mean?

I think we all know that the correct answer here is: I Will Be able to use my card anywhere. There is no other answer possible.
In addition to the answer, I have another question. Why did we need to go on a journey in order to learn this? Is it necessary? I know we are all adults, and I am not an immature kid. However, this sentence has really taken me by surprise (and I do not mean the journey part).
Any answers or suggestions are welcome, since this one really bothered me. Thank you in advance!
P.S. English is not my native language. But I hope the context helps a lot. If not feel free to correct me or ask for any clarifications.  ;)
EDIT: My apologies: it seems I did not express myself very well. I guess the question itself is quite clear, although the grammar part is a bit tricky. In order not to have any doubt, here are more examples that should make the problem clearer:
This: ""Will you please let me know if my order has been completed/placed?""
(I will be able) ""Please help me understand this question: will I be allowed to take my bag with me?"" 
""I am looking for a book that says: 'A man who will have nothing to do with women because he is very religious (a man that will not take part in sexual relationships)'.""
Thank you again!  :)
Edit 2: Thanks all for all the input! :) It's really amazing and helpful. Unfortunately, the answers will all remain unanswered for the next time I come across the same kind of problem, but I will try to read carefully the replies. :) And if I need clarification again, please feel my free hand. :))   :D
To all of you, thank you very much! I really appreciate this. It has made learning English a more fun exercise! Thanks. And keep it up! :)))
And if the OP really needed any clarification, as a new learner of English, he might find this link very helpful (although it is written in German) (http://www.linguee.de/cgi-bin/find_language_translation.pl?q=%22will%20you%...). And in"
423,Is My Card Usable Anywhere?,Considering this utterance: Is My Card Usable Anywhere? What is the intent that best describes it?,"1) Are you sure? If I am paying with my card, I must be ready to pay and I want to be sure that there is no problem before I use it.
2) I have no card with me, so I can take it anywhere I go and be assured that they won’t let me through with no charge. I don‘t want my charge card and the cash amount in my hand so that I may be prepared just in case. My card is in the car because I know that my wallet with cash was lost in a traffic accident two days ago and my friends are sure to tell me about it if this incident should occur again. It is very likely that the store will accept my payment and issue a receipt for me just like they always do. In this case, my intent is for assurance, which is something that should not be done when purchasing anything. The cash that is used for this purchase should go into my bank account as soon as possible, rather than going into a loss prevention program. Since I do not have any cash to go through the loss program, is this card usable anywhere? No!
3) When I get lost and in need of a cab, the cab driver is sure not to stop if they see that this car is using a credit card for payment. That makes me nervous since I just lost my credit and debit card in an accident, and it could mean that it was not insured. Also, that cab is a long way from the closest cab company and cab service for emergencies because they can‚t even give you a phone number. However, if I need a taxi and have cash on me at that moment, can I make it work? Yes! Even though I„m not sure exactly where my car accident occurred, it can certainly mean the difference between being able to get somewhere safely and getting lost. Therefore, this scenario is not a good candidate for a card that uses cash rather then credit (since the credit company can only charge interest at a certain rate). I would rather have it be a plastic card. If it is lost or stolen, what could the cabbie do to make up for it and how could I report it to the lost card company? It could get expensive. Even if the card were stolen without me knowing, how would I be able find it in time to return it so there could be no further"
424,Is It Acceptable To Use My Card Anywhere?,Considering this utterance: Is It Acceptable To Use My Card Anywhere? What is the intent that best describes it?,"My intent is to describe the situation, to provide a description of an uttering action performed by a human being. 
The utterances I've encountered:
It sounds good to me.
I am not sure if it sounds right. / It is not clear to my mind if the above two utterings are correct. It's not good but I am sure you will understand me / I do not quite understand the utterable action but can still accept it. I think these can be understood as ""I feel the action to be acceptable even though it is a bit uncertain."" I feel these utter-actions sound like ""You do know if you should act this way?"", ""Yes, I know that you think that I don't, but that's because you do."", ""Of course I act like that, because I'm me."", or ""It's OK for me to do this. You see, it's different for you. That's why I can say that.""
Are they correct? Does there exist a correct way in which to write this? I cannot find any references to it, nor can I find the meaning of this kind of sentence. Is it possible to use the same way for similar questions? For example: ""Why do people say X?"" with X referring to the word you have asked the question about? Or: How do you use this sentence if I want to talk about your attitude? It can mean ""Can I trust you, or have you deceived me?""
Thank you in advance!
P.S.: I have searched and searched for the sentence used to ask the last question (the one about attitude) but did not find one. The closest I found is: 'Why does someone act a certain way' I also found a definition of 'why' in German. But it seems that in general people don’t use it as 'I don''t quite see why' but as “I would like to know why you…” So the example sentence would look like this: ‘Why did she/he act that certainway?‘ which sounds strange to native ears. So it“s a native question for example. How does it differ from ’Why? Why do they do such and such‟
But if they don' use„Why‹, how would one write it then? Would it just"
425,Can I Use My Card Everywhere?,Considering this utterance: Can I Use My Card Everywhere? What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:
No, the question is about your card not the issuer. The answer is not about you.
The question could be reworded such that it would help people to know what your question actually is. This way it has the same meaning as the original one. You might find such a wording here: What does it mean when I see 'Can I use a card everywhere'?"
426,Where Is My Card Accepted?,Considering this utterance: Where Is My Card Accepted? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I think it's the following.
You are going to a place and you will probably have a card of some sort there that you want to use.  This is not an action that is part of the story, rather it is a statement that the author wants to make. And that statement can be made at the very start of your story or it can continue on throughout the whole of it. It just seems a little off to call a ""statement"" what is actually an ""action"" and it would be like saying, ""I have an apple and then I throw it away"". That's not what I intended!  What do you think the best way to word the sentence is?  
The only thing I could think of that would make sense for a sentence like the one I'm asking about would have to be something like:  I will be going there, but I do not know if I have credit card with me. I don't think that can work. Please help!
Edit:
To answer the edit from alexw: This question was written for English class and the writer was trying to express that, after a lot of thought, there was no good way of writing the statement about his card as he had been thinking and thinking about how he wanted his sentence to read and he felt this might be it, which is why the question seemed to him a bit out of place. However, as some have pointed out, when a question like this is asked in a professional writing environment, the answer can vary depending on how the work is supposed to reflect the voice of an established author. There is only one answer that I would deem to fit for this, and that answer is ""Where Is There My Credit Card?,"" which makes sense and is clear to me but may not make much sense in writing from the standpoint of what the teacher had in mind and what a good author would think. But that's just my opinion. Sorry for leaving so much room for interpretation. :/
So that answers part one. Part 2, I think, is: Why didn't the student choose the alternative? The student didn’t think about it much, because he doesn‘t have the time or inclination, perhaps, to work for hours on end on every word of his story and every sentence. His teacher may have had this in the back of mind because of their previous discussions about the"
427,Where Can I Pay With My Debit Or Credit Card?,Considering this utterance: Where Can I Pay With My Debit Or Credit Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"How do you know? The answer to these types of questions are what we refer to as “Intent”. There are 3 ways to analyze a sentence/utterance to determine the Intent of said utterances. These Intent analyses, which we’ll be discussing in more detail in our next section of the article, are named:

(1) Surface Form Analysis (Surface Analysis)
This analysis focuses on the actual utteranced itself. The form, order and word choices of a phrase, sentence or full text are used to try and ascertain what the speaker or writer is trying to convey. If the writer uses words that indicate he is angry, then his intent, or meaning, is likely to be angry.
The example in the sentence above is a great example of Surface Analysis. This is because the form of this sentence is simply: I want to buy this product/service. Notice how the simple word ‘want‘ is used and the word order, ’buy product service“. We know that ”want „ in this context, refers to a desire. And in a product or service context ‑‹ it is clear what ‐that desire is referring to. However, if there was any ambiguity, even a slight, in regards to the meaning of ‚want,‛ you would be able to use some of our other tools to help determine this. For example, here is some other examples of what this same sentence: could have been meant. (2) Lexical-Semantic AnalysisThe Lexicon is composed of all the words, including verbs, nouns and other words in your language. Words have meanings within the language, and within a specific context. When the lexicon, as used in Semantics, involves the analysis of word meanings. By analyzing the context of your sentences, word forms, the order of words and various other components, you can determine, to some degree, what meanings the sentences and phrases hold, regardless of actual meaning. Lexically, a word means its primary definition. A secondary definition might be, for example: ‫a noun which stands for a type, class, condition, state, quality‫, etc. With lexically analysis, words are simply the building blocks to form sentences. They are not the only building block, however, they are the most important. Sentence"
428,Where Should My Card Work?,Considering this utterance: Where Should My Card Work? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Do you believe that this is a true statement of the situation of a given card? What can you conclude by the fact that it is not?

The card is in the middle. This means that the subject matter is something in between. The subject and/or the action is either in process, in progress, or in an upcoming stage. In this case it means there is some form of development going on (a move) but there are some issues to be dealt with beforehand (the card’s position). The fact of being between two other cards means it cannot go anywhere right away, but it will definitely have some impact or progress in a couple of steps.
This card may be about the current situation but this also means change, a process and development. If you‘re in charge, that also implies you can“make things happen”. It means you have power, authority, influence, and your position is strong. On the other hand, there might be a need for cooperation and collaboration. There is room for negotiation and compromise. For a new business it could mean taking a risk. Or even for a relationship, it might mean having an open and honest conversation. Whatever the case, you need to take your foot off the gas (so not go too fast) before it can move forward. You must have the courage to change something. Do not try to force a move and change without consideration to the consequences. Be willing to compromise and work through the process. Your authority is your power. So, don t try and use it if it‪is‬ not right. Think what is truly in your best interest and act accordingly to it. Keep the big picture in mind. 
A great way to make this card work is to use the Law of Three (three-card spread, three-suit spread or three element spread) by putting your current three cards in any three positions. Doing so will show you what to do (what is important for you now) and what you should not do. Then, think about what could happen if you were to not have this situation (it could lead to a different outcome) to guide your actions and decisions. By applying Law in this way, I․m not saying‚ you cannot make up your own mind, only that you must think of other people too. Consider what others may think or feel and how it"
429,Areas Card Is Accpeted,Considering this utterance: Areas Card Is Accpeted What is the intent that best describes it?,"a.
‘This card is accepted at the areas listed on the reverse side.’
b. ‘These locations are listed as accepted areas on this card. Please bring it with you when you come in. If it is lost, you are allowed to return it to any of the locations on that card or at any other locations within 30 days of first use. Thank you so much for shopping with us. We hope you will come back again soon! If you need help with any questions about your purchases, or if we can assist you in any way, be sure to check the Help tab. You can also click on My Account at checkout on each page of your order, to review order history. Thanks for your business!”
c. [The best answer is “b“.]
d. None of them is correct. The sentence states the accepted locations, but does not indicate whether the person speaking is referring to the entire card list or to a specific list. (For more on how to make decisions on grammar points, check out our How to Know Grammar Point article.)
e. I think the best way to answer the question for you is to read the sentence aloud and ask yourself, ” What does ’areas accepted‟ mean?‖
Answer: „I agree that b is probably the only way of making the most sense. But I have a hard time with this one. It seems strange that the cardholder, and not the merchant, can decide whether to accept a card in a certain location. However, I realize that this is how our credit system is set up. So this can be a good thing. As a writer, though, this kind of wording makes me cringe. Maybe I just feel that a merchant is accepting a charge to an account. This is a common, everyday word, as in the phrase ‚charge account‛. Therefore, maybe the answer to this question could be ‛I‚m not sure. To be honest, it doesn„t sound right to me. Can anyone help me out? I‹m so close to being right…› †
2. A. 1 + 2 =
B. 8 – 2 + 6 = 8 + 4 = 12
C. 2 – 6 + 14 = 1 - 4 + 9 = 13
D. -3 +"
430,Places I Can Use The Card,Considering this utterance: Places I Can Use The Card What is the intent that best describes it?,"It describes what he wanted to accomplish in the moment and what came after.
1. I can tell him where he can use the card.2. He can ask me to tell which places he should use it in.3. The first one is probably the best one. It's like he said, “Here! This guy will use this card,” and I tell you where to put it.4. And I might tell this guy that he cannot use those cards in those places. ‘Cause I'm in control, and the person doesn't like the rules. So I just tell them ”Don't use that card there.’5. In that other example, it's the third one—like ’cause he's not really the boss, I don't tell his boss which place he needs to use his card in and so on. Or I say, let's go to this place. You can always use your card anywhere you want.6. That's how it is with my card and my phone, also. If I want to call somebody, if I ask what's my next destination and then I get off the phone and decide to go somewhere else for some reason, then the same thing happens again.7. Let's say I've been traveling to the United States a lot because of the jobs they have here and that's also a reason why my husband decided to get a new job here.8. Well, he works for the government, so the place we're going is government property. But if someone else comes to my work and asks for my help, for instance, my boss or my co-worker, they'll tell her ‹that the guy in this office, that the one who helps with that.9. We're actually on our way to work.10. No, there's no way I'd go over to that guy's place and use my cards. Because what if he didn't want that?11. Now he doesn›t remember the time or he‚ll want me again, but I do know where I need to be for this."
431,Can I Make Online Purchases With My Card?,Considering this utterance: Can I Make Online Purchases With My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it an affirmative ""yes"" or a negative ""no"" response? It's very important that the reader understands what you are saying. When someone asks me, ""Can I make online purchases with my card?"" they are expecting an ""affirmative"" answer. In reality, it's a question that's designed to make you answer ""Yes.""

The following examples help you understand that ""No"" is NOT an answer:
• Yes, I'm going to buy a car online this week.
Yes, there is a problem with our credit card. Let me speak to our IT Department about it."
432,Does Every Place Of Business Accept This Card?,Considering this utterance: Does Every Place Of Business Accept This Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is the speaker trying to be humorous, to shock? Or simply to get a point across?

What other examples could you find for this? How would these compare to your experience? Do these examples fit any of the categories below?"
433,What Places Will Accept My Card?,Considering this utterance: What Places Will Accept My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The question of what people will accept when I pay with my card in their shop, is a question that comes up often. In this essay, I will take a look at this question and some of the answers to it.
I should point out that my analysis is done without taking a side in the debate about EMV. My understanding, and that of most people I know, was that EMVs are a means to authenticate transactions, to make the process safer, but not as yet an absolute way, a technology to replace the need for the signature. This is in contrast with the more recent push by some to have the public move over to the chip only model. That is not what I am going for in this piece. I believe that all of us should learn the lessons from the existing technology and not be scared of it, nor not see it as a necessary change at the point of sale. The card-present model is here to stay in my mind. But I do understand that there are many people who do not feel the same way towards the technology, which may be due to past experience or maybe because they are too afraid to get their hands dirty in all the change that goes with this. Regardless, this is for those among you and I who are curious to learn what to expect. Now to my answer.I am using the question: what places in our world will be able to accept my bank-card-payment? It is meant to be as inclusive as possible in order to capture as many potential places of payment as we can. To do this, there is need to understand all possible places that could be relevant to a bank card payment and how they might be affected by the new technology. Some of you may know already what the answer is, since it is often mentioned in online stores like Amazon and in places like McDonald's. So we will not talk about those places. Instead, we are going to focus on places where the card could potentially be used that are in general not yet on an EMVC-enabled payment system and could in theory also have EM-readers in them. For example, it will most likely not work to pay at a place that does not accept chip cards, or if the merchant uses an old version of EMVI/EMV II and cannot read and authentiate the EM. And there may also be places you are not thinking of where EM is possible but I"
434,Can I Use My Card Anywere?,Considering this utterance: Can I Use My Card Anywere? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it a question about whether I can use my card in my car?

I believe this question can be rephrased with the same grammatical construction so that the question becomes:
Can I use this card anywhere? 
The word anywhere is a relative pronoun and in this context, as I understand it, it refers to where the card is. Therefore, the re-worded question would be: Do you know where I could use the Credit Card? In essence, I am asking if you are aware of a location that allows people to use your card.
This can also be rewritten in the form of: Are you telling me where you can allow me to withdraw the money?"
435,Will Any Business Take This Card?,Considering this utterance: Will Any Business Take This Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What does the sentence mean? Is it literal or metaphorical?

This utterances: will any business take this card? and What will happen to the customers if I do not pay the bills? How should I understand this sentences? Please discuss. Thanks
I am not able to understand meaning of this sentence. Is this literal? Does it mean ""will any customers accept this offer?"" If this, Is its literal meaning same in all the nations and languages? Thanks 
It is not literal. It means ""do you accept?"" I don't understand the meaning.  Do you know the exact meaning and usage of will?  Thanks.
""Will any company/anyone/anything accept that you offer them something?""
If yes, what's the point? Who will reject your offer? This could happen if you do something illegal or unwise. Who would reject it other than the police? So, It's not true in our normal day to day life. But it is true when you give/say something. ""Will you take it""?
The sentence means that if some people accept you and take something from you, then that will not cause them any problems, because you have given them this opportunity. That means you don’t have to worry about them rejecting it and then you would have wasted so much of your time and efforts. This is a good time to be bold and make a bold move. So will some businesses accept the offer or not? That is another question. They could reject, but that would not be a big issue. If they reject then it means they are not your target market or you could have better alternatives in their area. There is no point in saying this to a market that is filled with your competitors. You should know your market beforehand. Once you find out the type of people who would want your products and services, you should make your approach to those people in the right way. And if they accept, great! If not, there is always another market. We cannot just give our time for every market and expect to get our money‟s worth. When you ask this question: „Will anyone take that card,” You need to think of what is happening inside that company and what the reaction will be. Will he/she accept? There are some companies that accept everything you are offering even though they have enough offers. These companies don`"
436,Will Filling Stations Accept My Card?,Considering this utterance: Will Filling Stations Accept My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"1. A request to a store for a service.
2. An observation about the state of a situation. (e.g., ""If you run out of gas, the car won't start."")
3. The speaker's own belief or desire. (""I hope I don't run into any other cars on the road, because I would like to stop and buy a sandwich."")"
437,Do I Have To Verify My Identity?,Considering this utterance: Do I Have To Verify My Identity? What is the intent that best describes it?,"For the person who said that, I would like to know the answer to my following questions (and please share any others you think of if any):
1) Do you consider the above utterances to be an attempt to deceive, or not? Do they indicate some kind of ill-willed intent to harm you (e.g. a person that might go so far as wanting to steal information off of a PC)?
2) If not, what is your thought as to the reason why it was said in such a way? (i.e., is it simply because of the way it sounds?)
3) Did you notice the word ""myself"" in the question? The question asked, ""Do I HAVE TO verify my identity when you say to give it?"" The use of that word, to me, indicates that the speaker believes that he or she has the right to verify your identity and that you don't have a choice in it because you must agree to it or else he/she will refuse to do business with you on this site. Am I right in this assessment? Is there a word (or a phrase of words) that I might be overlooking that would make it clear that this question really meant something else to him/her? Thank you very much for your input.
4) Lastly, is there anything else I have ""missed"" or is this all clear? If there is anything more that could be added to this, please do and I will happily add it to what I've written. Thanks again. Have a nice day!

438,Why Do You Need To Know So Much About Me,Considering this utterance: Why Do You Need To Know So Much About Me What is the intent that best describes it?,"The answer to the above question is, in my opinion, a rather easy one. You see, we need to know so much about you not so that we can “know” what we want about YOU but rather so we know what to say, because the truth about our subject must be ‘revealed,’ or, at very least, presented. This is what I am speaking of!
Let me elaborate:
There are those who know me, and those whose only knowledge about me is derived from gossip, rumors and hearsay. Then, there is a third group, the ones who are genuinely curious. Now, I understand the first group because, like my mom used to tell me about when I was a kid, ” People don‚??t care until they care about You!“
Then, my guess is that the second group might just see it as a ‚?.
‘‹, or a way to gain some type of advantage. Either way it is just plain mean because it puts the person in the position of „judging„ me in front of people that I know and love. I‟m guessing there might be those on that side of the line that don;t see this as mean at all because they‭ ‬, as I do, see them as people, people with feelings just like me. But they might also see those of us on the other side as the ‭‮, those ‫‪ that are just ‪‬‰.‫ I don't think it should matter. And it probably just shows how mean people are that they would use a subject in such a manner. The person on one side just has no respect for the subject. No consideration for her. Nothing. It is so easy to be mean. Especially if it comes from out of nowhere, from no real knowledge of her, just out to hurt, cause trouble, hurt someone‛s feelings, you know. Or maybe a little knowledge, but just to show how smart they are. Not to mention, maybe just because ’ she‡, they just find fun in being mean, cruel or rude to someone. They might even make a game out it. That›s mean! And that‖s rude! What kind of person would even do this? Someone"

   B) Why did I think of this?  A way to say, ""I didn't like the way you presented yourself"".

A:
There's no reason to suspect he's lying, if he isn't he would not admit it. It's also a valid response to something as silly as a phone call from someone claiming to be from the IRS (not that the claim to actually be the agency is valid, but you could still be a scammer)."
440,I Cannot Verify My Identity,Considering this utterance: I Cannot Verify My Identity What is the intent that best describes it?,"What would be a correct analysis? Can you describe all of the information you would need in order to verify your identity?

This utterances can be used in a variety of scenarios. Some examples might include:
– “Please verify my ID”
-“I don’t have my birth certificate„
(in an interview)
In some situations you might hear such a phrase because your ID is needed immediately, and the person asking for it is in panic/agitated. In these situation the best thing to do would probably be to calm them down and give them your name and phone number and let them call the police if they need help verifying your identification, because they might have a problem with the identification.
The most interesting fact about this phrase is that it can have multiple meanings, which may help a student be prepared. The phrase I Can Not Verify my Identity may mean: 1) I am unable to prove who I really am (in some context) 2) You‘re not who you say you are, you can‟t prove what you‚¬‹say (when the student lies) or 3) What I think you mean is „I cannot be 100% sure who or what I‛ª am‫.

To the best of my knowledge. It is in my nature to always be a good and kind person so to be called out as a bad person would be really disconcerting to my character. I would like to hear any ideas that any of the great teachers, spiritual masters etc etc could use to help me with this situation.

I have been called this name many many times and it really gets to me. But I know it is not really me that does it. And that if it were, then I wouldn't have to suffer. Just thought I'd throw it out to see what the wise say as to this matter. Thank you for having this thread."

If ""The Kenny that the app believes it is"" had the same ""name"" as the Kenny in reality, the ""App"" would believe it was that specific Kenny and not Kenny, because the two people are similar in many respects.
So, if Kenny was asked by the person who had ""him"" if he knew him, how could that person know for sure if they're talking to Kenny? Even if it's a Kenny-like person, they could be talking and acting like their real self. But, it wouldn`t be the true Kenny.

443,I Am Having Trouble Verifying My Identity.,Considering this utterance: I Am Having Trouble Verifying My Identity. What is the intent that best describes it?,"In my personal life, I have a tendency of over-analyzing situations, trying to figure out the best possible outcome for a given situation. When I was a student in college, for example, when I went out to eat, a lot of my friends would order a certain dish, and I would have to order something else – because we were always in a rush, etc. I’d spend several minutes trying and analyzing what my friend meant to be saying, before I figured out what he/she really meant, or if maybe he was just saying something stupid, without thinking. My friends and even some of the teachers in class always commented on my “paranoia”, because I seemed to over analyze situations.
Now, as a business consultant, overanalyze is a very different term. There are some people who are good at that, others not so much. It‘s like a superpower in their minds. For example one of our clients, the client is an engineer, who is one the smartest people I know. His mind goes into high gear, analyzing situations and trying different ways to solve the problem. In business, this is good; in life it is very problematic. A problem with him is that he often times will ‘think out of his box“, which can lead to him over complicating things. He does have an incredibly fast thinking ability, but if there are 2 or more options as to how he could solve a particular problem, he will always look at the most difficult way out. The thing about him, is it isn‚Äôt that it actually is difficult, it just seems like it because of how much effort he has to put into it. This doesn„Å kind of thing has also been happening with me, at least with this particular project.

444,What Do I Do If My Verification Failed,Considering this utterance: What Do I Do If My Verification Failed What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it more appropriate to think about this sentence as if it were the main question of an entire conversation? Or is this just one sentence in the midst of a conversation or a paragraph in a document? 

A:
(Edit: I originally stated that this was a rhetorical question, which it is not. The OP has asked this as a direct question and is asking for the correct meaning. I am only posting as I was originally asked.)
What I would do is look at it in terms of it being a sentence that you're quoting, with your own comment, or something.
The context is that the speaker is a student, so it sounds less like a question in context, but like the statement a professor could give to a class. For that reason, I'd consider this a statement in some form of ""formal speech"", as it's being delivered to someone. In fact, you can see it as an aside from the rest of the sentence:  

 My father died a year ago, and I'm the executor of his estate...
 -- What do I do if my verification failed?"

–
I have to say that I have no idea what ‘it‘ is here. I just think the verb ‚impossible ‹could be› used as an adjective, and if so, it would mean that he was describing the method of how he would prove that it was „impossiible‟ to verify his identity. In this context, ‬impossibility‪ would be a very strange usage of the word that is certainly not a common or technical usage. Maybe if you explain the context to us, you can let us know.‬
. –
It may be possible to use ”It is impossible to prove my identity„, or ‟It would seem that they could not verify my Identity‖ as the best way to explain his utterances. But what we would like to know is what is ‑it′ here, if there is one, not what would you suggest is it."
446,The App Doesn'T Know It'S Me.,Considering this utterance: The App Doesn'T Know It'S Me. What is the intent that best describes it?,"The first sentence is a statement of fact (which I'm assuming we could argue about in the context of whether or not that's a ""fact""). I would read it as if the app was stating that it has no knowledge of who the user is.
As for the second:
This is an exclamation of surprise. I think that is what you're asking. The app probably is surprised that the device's location is being displayed to me, because, well, it doesn't have that information, nor does it have any knowledge that this device is me. 
In other words, no, I don't think the first phrase is talking about the fact that ""It doesn’t know it's me"" but rather, ""the app doesn' know that there's even an app running""
So, in short, the answer to your question is that both sentences are saying the same thing, with slightly different tones."

450,The App Failed To Verify My Identity.,Considering this utterance: The App Failed To Verify My Identity. What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:
It has the sense of ""the attempt has failed"" as in the sentence ""I tried to call her on the telephone but the call was unsuccessful"".
But ""It failed to verify my identity"" has a slightly stronger, more literal sense, which would be ""Something has been used to try to confirm or establish my identification, but it failed or fell short, for example: A credit check did not go smoothly.""  So if I call my bank to make a transaction, and they can't verify that I am who I say I AM then ""They failed verify My ID.""
If I make an online transaction and do not know for sure that they have verified what I'm saying then it's a ""failed verification."""

Is my understanding correct? Is it more than the literal meaning of the text? Are there any other meanings that can be inferred from this? 
I ask, because this sounds weird to me.. ""can't"" is normally used in context to imply that you can't do something, not that the thing you are trying to prove or claim is actually false. For example:   ""I can' eat this cake, but I can prove my existence/authenticity of ID"".. or  ""...but I cannot prove I own my car, so I must prove this fact"" (not ""but the fact"")
What is meant when saying ""you cannot"" and ""we cannot""?

453,I Am Not Being Recognized By The App.,Considering this utterance: I Am Not Being Recognized By The App. What is the intent that best describes it?,"""The intent was just to have some fun,"" says the author. ""I was really surprised when the story blew up as much as it did. It's kind of a mystery, really.""
That story was called ""The Art of Fiction."" It appeared in the December 2004 edition of Harvard Review. He has written about 20 stories for Harvard's famous undergraduate literary publication, The Belfry, and his fiction has been published in The Atlantic and many other magazines.
When I interviewed him for the Web site of the Academy of American Poets, he was about to fly back from Paris, where he'd spent the past year living, writing, teaching poetry and being a visiting scholar. When I asked what he thought would be most interesting on this particular day, I heard, ""What have you been doing in Europe?""
In the interview he told me about ""Art of"" and the Parisian experience. Here's the beginning of our conversation:
The Academy Interview
Q: How does your poetry compare with other poetry written by Americans living abroad? And how was your experience as a professor of poetry in France? Are your students' experiences abroad different from yours, as you were teaching here in America when you moved to Paris? What's your take on the differences? I know I could ask about your teaching and other subjects...
AB: As I've learned over the years, American poetry is a vast, unruly, sprawling territory. But the American landscape tends to look different, or look more American, after a certain number of years away. What seems to happen over here is that you start writing a lot in English, which in turn helps make you feel more familiar, more at home, even, in a strange world. You get comfortable in your own skin. I suppose my teaching situation, while different than it once was, had the same effect. After two years in that French school, my students seemed so natural to me, that I'd feel as though I were back in Cambridge. In some ways, though, being in Paris has made me return home a little more. The American literature course I taught was so much easier, a kind-of crash course in American prose literature, for example; and now, since I spend so many nights in this city, the things I read are closer to home. That's a very positive thing for an American-born poet to hear!"
454,Why Isn'T My Id Being Verified?,Considering this utterance: Why Isn'T My Id Being Verified? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What is best to represent the meaning in that uttering? What kind of information is needed for it to be valid (and what are the limitations of the type of that information)? What kinds of errors can occur while processing this information? How would it best be verified?  
I'm aware that the sentence is informal or conversational (in the first person and about one's own self). I also know that an utter that doesn't have any information associated with it cannot be processed.  So, if the question is: can an informal sentence be understood at all, what can be considered to process the utter? Can an id be assigned or interpreted as an object? If it can, can it still be represented? I know this isn't an easy or direct question.
EDIT:
The question comes from the use of ""my"" as a reference for some id (I guess) that represents that person's information. For example:  ""Why my id isn' verifying?"". Is that considered as ""me""?
And how can I process that question? Should I consider the speaker as the id? Or me? And the answer to this question can also help me to understand what is really going on here. It seems that if it's me, then I'd have to make a distinction between the ""I"" (the speaker) and the information represented by the me id. That doesn' seem valid for a formal question though. I'm just not sure. Also, how would I handle the error case, i.e. if I can't make the distinction, should I just say that it doesn'?
If it helps to answer this, a more specific question would be: what would you consider to validate this sort of id, e.g. the case of an error? It just doesn''t make sense when you use your id and say ""why my ____ isn'' verifying"" where  is a type you are representing. If someone else tries to verify ""You"" or the system as being valid, shouldn't it be ""you?""
Thanks. Any help or insight to understanding that would help. Much appreciated. The more insight the better. Sorry it has been a little unclear. Thank you. :)  :)
P.S. In the context of formal grammars, I understand that this is not the best place to ask about ""what are you"
455,The App Will Not Let Me Into My Account.,Considering this utterance: The App Will Not Let Me Into My Account. What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it a command, a wish, an imperative, etc? If it's not one of those, it may still imply a reason why not, i.e. you don't have access to the app.
What you say, though, doesn't imply what I think you mean: ""The App will not allow me to log in"". So I'd need some clarification on what you are saying and I believe you're just not getting clarity on that. I'll assume you'll give some more info on this as well (or on another question) if you need clarification."
456,I Am Having Trouble Proving My Identity.,Considering this utterance: I Am Having Trouble Proving My Identity. What is the intent that best describes it?,"How might that affect the choices that the speaker makes? What does that tell us about the relationship between the self and the world?

""If you do not understand how important the role of women is in the development of a community and society, then you certainly do understand the importance of the issue of poverty."" -- President Barack Obama, State of The Union address, 5 January 2014.
...
“We can either be a nation of families whose parents can rely on at least some of their hard-earned money for food, housing and transportation, or we can become a land of strangers who can be as easily exploited as those who are less fortunate.” -- Governor Bill Clinton, speech, 14 October 1995....
I think I get the gist here. What do you think? Do these two quotes reflect how Clinton and Obama felt about poverty? Why? Did the context help or hurt in answering the question above? Or, in both cases, how might the choice of different words have changed the answer to both the questions? And why is Clinton’s quote a bit more powerful than Obama‘s on this topic? (I‚Äôm sorry. I think this is a great question. Thank you.)
Please share some thoughts on the two speeches above. How could the speakers have made them better? I‟m interested in hearing about any other thoughts about how the speeches might relate to how we think about inequality and poverty. Thanks!

457,I Cannot Prove My Own Identity.,Considering this utterance: I Cannot Prove My Own Identity. What is the intent that best describes it?,"It seems to me that it may be interpreted as either ""You cannot prove you are what you say you"" or ""The concept of proving you were born is invalid"".

My view is that this is a very complex question which requires a great depth of understanding of human reasoning. I believe you would benefit greatly from a thorough understanding. Unfortunately I cannot help you with that.
I hope that my answer serves the purposes of discussion, however, I would like to know more about the subject, before I respond. Is this question on topic here on the forum?
If not, perhaps we could discuss the matter over in the meta.se forum. 
Note: There are many many other reasons why one could say: ""I Cannot prove my own identity"". It isn't what I am interested in. The subject of the question is ""Why can't we prove ourselves?"".

A:

459,I Can Not Get The App To Know It Is Me.,Considering this utterance: I Can Not Get The App To Know It Is Me. What is the intent that best describes it?,"The first sentence seems to be saying I am the app, however the second one seems like he is saying he isn't the real me (he is just another version of me).

My understanding of the first one is that I'm not saying who I truly am (since I couldn't), but a mere version or replica of myself.
How do we know it's a false sense of self? Is it a contradiction and/or a mistake? 
I can not use the verb be because I would be using the past tense to describe the state or condition of being the true version and the replica at the same time. In this case, it would mean I have been in a constant state of not realizing it is me for all the years I've been existing.   This doesn't sound right to me. Could someone help me? Am I interpreting this wrong? Any advice would help!
EDIT: Added a couple more sentences to try and explain my reasoning a little more..  I think this is clearer. Thank you for your time!  :)
Sentence 1: He is a clone of his previous self. He cannot tell the difference between that clone and his ""true"" self
This seems right. The previous one isn’t aware there is another self and they are identical. There is no contradiction (at least that is my understanding). It's just that the new one has no idea. This is similar to when someone is told their friend is dead, and then the friend shows up alive. They are both the ""same"", but have no knowledge of each other. If they were the exact same person, then there should be awareness of this. It would seem strange if they weren't aware, or if you were to tell him he was now dead and he didn't think it was him. Also, the fact that this other self/version is not aware of him seems wrong. I can't tell if this should mean they both are aware they're two different versions of I, since we aren't talking about the actual I. So I guess I need clarification..
Here is sentence 2
  ""He cannot get his mind to stop thinking he's the App, but he knows it isn' a real version, because he doesn' have an App.""
Is ""he isn"" a reference to the previous version? Or should it be ""him"""

462,I Am Having Difficulties To Verify My Identity.,Considering this utterance: I Am Having Difficulties To Verify My Identity. What is the intent that best describes it?,"Intentional or unintentional? This is a pretty interesting question, and something I have pondered a lot during my life. I will use this blog post as an example of these questions in life, because it has been a long time since I last published about the topic (at least a year), and I am feeling inspired to blog about it all over again. So let’s talk a little about these intentions.
So, what is “intentional”? I believe that if you want change in your life you must intend for change to be part of your future. It‘s not about being wishful or wishing things were different, it„s about making a commitment that you are going to change, or improve your situation. This can include small things (I can‚t remember what I intend to accomplish today), to large changes (a job or relationship change). It seems like it should be really simple, but unfortunately I“ve heard people say and do all sorts of things which indicate that they don‪t really mean it. Maybe it is because they do it for a good reason, maybe because of an emotion, like a fear or a regret, either way – they are often not intentional. In other words, they might not really even recognize that it was an „intention‬ (for lack of a better word – it could be a subconscious intention or just the feeling of something). The other option is that this might be unintentional. But there are also ‚mistakes‟ when it comes to intentions - you make the intention but you don't really intend it or it's an unintended consequence. What can we learn from this? That there›s‰always‹something‖wrong․ If you have any intention, then there will be problems.※
I am very inspired by the book ""The Power of Intention"", by Joseph Chilton Pearce, which is written on this very same subject. (A short story on his life and some more information on the power of intention: https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/9554595-life-is-the-great-power-of-intention-what-if-you-do -the?utm=post&fromtags=Intent)
To summarize this article, we could say"
463,The App Doesn'T Believe That I Am Me,Considering this utterance: The App Doesn'T Believe That I Am Me What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is the speaker asking for a reaction, or just offering a description as it is, and the reaction is expected? 

A:
""The app believes that I am a user with a particular location, an age, a gender, etc., who likes pizza, has a job, lives in Los Angeles or New York City""
The speaker is not trying to be cute, nor does it come across as sarcastic, it just has an effect of stating a fact, which could be taken in a few different ways.
If you are asking the person to react to the information in the app, I would say the word ""believes"" should be used, as that is what the computer is saying. If you're asking them about the fact that it has stated that, well, they may not be surprised, in which case you can leave out ""it"".
In the case of a ""who"", it doesn't really mean anything, so it's usually implied in conversation, but it might work in this case."

What the person intended, or if he meant a specific thing is a different problem. 

A:
""I am not verifying my identity""
This is an idiomatic English expression used to indicate that one's identity is not something that needs to be verified. That is, the speaker is willing to accept the assertion of his/her identity in the absence of evidence (e.g., in a legal setting)."
465,What Do I Need To Verify My Id?,Considering this utterance: What Do I Need To Verify My Id? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What else might I be trying to express?

In this example the person is saying that they need to verify their identity. That the police should take the time to do this.
To me that doesn’t sound like a happy person saying this, it sounds like an angry person. I think what they are really trying is, They think that if I can‘t give my name the officer should let me go. So that the next person, who is happy, can have the information. Or maybe that it isn”s a way to tell the cops to piss off and don“t bother trying."

What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it the statement that the user is trying to communicate a message? Or does it communicate that a process is in place that is supposed to show or tell the system that it is really the ID this identity was created under? 
In this case, it was trying, but failed:

A:

 ""That would be my identity, and that's a problem, because it's not my real identity.""
The intent of this question is to convey the speaker's inability to identify a particular system.  The user isn't trying   to inform the OS that he isn’t the owner of the identity.
To answer your question, I believe that this sentence is communicating two things:  (1) there is an identity for you which is not the one you were asked for, or (2) the computer has a default password which isn' the correct password."

3) Something is wrong with who I think I should be. I have no idea who this person is. Or I do but I can not figure out what she should look like. It is not my personality or my values or who knows what else. So I must be wrong about who she is because I just cannot understand her..
4) This person does not feel like herself and it is important to her that she knows who that person really is so that the person can know who is this. The person has a sense that something is broken with the way that this self is being experienced in a world that expects that we are in control of and know what is going on. This feeling is painful and disturbing and does have a hold over her. She feels the problem is her and she needs help fixing it or figuring out the source of it, but she does no know where or how.. She does understand that there are other people that share this feeling. They are very different from each other and this is how she has described it to me. Some are not in touch with what this source that is trying to be realized is at all. But a few are and one of them has told her to read this site and see if maybe this will help. A different one is more interested in figuring it out and has gone beyond her initial desire to just let her know that someone else shares this experience with her in their life as well. Another person feels like she just got in on the ground floor of all this and is doing her best to stay in it all by her lonesome. Yet, another person knows that they are different but they really do have one thing in common in that all three of us do feel this way about our identities and that a person could be identified that does this but we don't know the specifics about them and we do not know if they have had this problem for the same length of time that has impacted who we think we should become, etc,

his behavior. He is always checking his cell phone, for example. His

people would be embarrassed if they had someone else do their job as a

For example, if I send a text on a cell phone, my SMS is verified. Why is that? There's no need for an app to be involved. SMS works fine. So why do I have to have an authentication app involved? This app does not need authentication or security at all. There is nothing special about it. And I do not want to use SMS, email, or the internet. All those have their own problems. If you send an email to someone, you know it can be intercepted. You don't know if you can trust the email server. The internet has a lot of security holes and other problems that SMS doesn't have. They should be fixed. But why is it OK to require an extra app here? Why don' t they ask me to do this in the first place? The app is not even involved at the beginning. Only after I use it for the second or third time and it asks me ""You already have a PIN from XYZ. Do you want me ask you for your PIN now? (Y or N)"" And it won't let me answer 'N'. I'll have no choice but to type in my password. Which is what I was afraid of all along. Then it will give me a verification code and ask ""Verify your identity"" or something similar. That's not what the app should do. Because there's nothing to identify, no credentials, nothing at that point. No PIN. Just a plain phone or mobile number (or whatever it would be like on an Android). I would not have anything to authenticate, and nothing that is valuable to steal. After I type my ID number in, they might ask for more stuff but that would have nothing else to validate. Is all this a bug? Are there security considerations I don`t know about? Is there a reason my bank cannot ask about my credentials in their app directly? I just want my number to work like an SMS does,"
478,Why Can'T I Verify My Id?,Considering this utterance: Why Can'T I Verify My Id? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This utterances is: the one whose purpose is to verify the identity of a user who has logged in to the system.
I would like to ask if this is correct for the following reasons:
The person who wants to do that: has the need to check his/her identity (in order to be allowed to proceed)
And the other person, the person that would receive that intent to login and verify identity: it is not important to know who is who, it will do the task (check identity) and then log out, and if the login is valid then he will proceed to his account to carry out his task.  
Does this understanding of this situation fits? Are there any flaws on it?

Replied by @J: @John_Fenton I would say: A. (1) I am a resident of the U.S.; or (2) My identification is not in my name at this time; or, or D.) (I know, I know - just answer the question)
+
The problem is with ""C."". In my situation, if a company asks for the state in which I live, that means that you do NOT need to prove your SS# (which is assigned to a US State and is tied to your birth state). You are only concerned with verifying that the person calling you is indeed who they say they are.
If you live in New York or Texas...and someone calls you from one of those states telling you that your name is on their DOB records they will not ask you to verify your state and your ID is enough for verification. If this is NOT the case, then you need your social and DOBs, your drivers license AND proof that they were issued in that particular name. Not proof from the State...proof you are the legal person in question. The question was asked by someone else on the forum. What's your interpretation? I do it as well when someone asks me where I'm from and I tell them I don't know and am not answering. Just as it should be. It's an ID issue. This forum is about ID issues. Don't you think that this person was looking for more than answers to their ID problem or questions to help solve their problem? Maybe they wanted help from you? How do you feel about the way you were treated? Why does it make you so mad? What would you like to say to the people who called this woman? Would a simple ""No I wouldn't"" do? Is the answer """

What is the intent that best describes it?,"This utterances is a very broad one, and it’s pretty much impossible to find the “best” intent without first having an understanding of the person who is speaking. As a general rule of thumb it is not a good idea to take these sorts of utterings as a way to figure out a person‘s intent.
A person may be able to give the answer in broad terms (“I‖ ‘like‚ to write‡ about the things that make me happy.‰) without really knowing what it means for them.  
It‹s hard to do with a real person since they often know the best way of answering a question is to show the other person. The answer ‹„I like to watch› , or ‟I don‟t like‬ to have children because‮they‴cause me too much stress. These „tells‵ tell you more about what the user is thinking than what he/she is actually‥ thinking. (Or even what they are really saying!)

(This is my first response, please correct any mistakes)
If the context of your answer to ""How Do i Set Up My PIN For the New Cards?"" is, ""What is Pin code for X,"" then this is a question asking for a fact. However, I think your intention was to ask for clarification regarding an existing fact, so the question is probably too broad. You should probably ask a more specific question like How do I make the new cards work in my computer? or something similar. I'm sorry if this answer was a bit of an annoyance but I hope that clears things up. Feel free to re-edit the original post though to fix this. :)
Edit: Oh, just now I noticed your edit, and I've added that it was not my intention to have been too annoying. My apologies for that. :/

486,How Do I Find My Card Pin?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Find My Card Pin? What is the intent that best describes it?,"You are trying to find out how to get your card pin? Perhaps you are looking to purchase or renew a card?

The first answer you gave to the above utterances tells us something about your personality. In other words, your response shows us how you process information. It can be helpful, or it can not be. But if we want to learn if it is helpful to us or not, then we must go deeper and look at the answer from a deeper level. And, as we have discovered previously, we can only learn this when we understand the answers to our own questions.
We have also learned that we need to be sure we are asking the right questions, to do this. Now we find that the question that follows the ""How Do you Find"" is also part of the message. You should be aware of what you want the result to say about you. That is why this question is so important, not only in this case, but in any situation in which you answer ""yes"" to it. This is because the more you understand about yourself and the less you think and act unconsciously, the bigger the chance that your answers show a better understanding of who you really are, and who, therefore, you can really become. As we look into our answers, it becomes clearer and clearer to ourselves who we really want, need or are. Therefore, when you look deep into the meaning of your own answers you come to realize that you will have a good chance at becoming the person you always wanted to become, because deep inside you know who that person really is and you recognize it as the real truth about who and what we truly are!

487,Is My Card Pin Saved In The App,Considering this utterance: Is My Card Pin Saved In The App What is the intent that best describes it?,"(A - Intention - is a purpose or an aim.

Can anyone explain to me how to express ""is it saved"" in a similar way to your last example? I.e, what is/are the intention(s) which are/is being expressed with the utterances: ""I'm going to save"" or ""You're the first one to use it"".
Thank you very much!
I really do have a great understanding on the general usage of this expression.
Just have some difficulty grasping the exact meaning when it is being used with a specific noun or pronoun. 
Is it just a general way of saying ""what has already been done?"" as in ""What have already you done with that card?"".
Or is it a more specific one? In the sense that ""Have you saved it?""
or ""Has anyone saved your card?"" and then ""Did you save it?"". ""Do you think it will be saved?"".   Is it as simple as ""you have saved my card""
It is so confusing to understand that it seems like it may have two meanings. Or it could just be two different ways of using the same thing in the sentence. But I am still unsure. If someone could clear this doubt up. It would be much appreciated. Thanks!  :)
Please let me know in your answers. :)  I will appreciate it. Thank you for your help! :).  :D

It doesn't seem to be a ""Don't Know"" question. The first would make sense. But the second does not.
But then I have always thought that the 'Don"" part of that statement would have been used to add emphasis to something that was already written. It doesn''t sound so strange to me that this might be the case. Perhaps that is not an English sentence, however. Maybe that ''is'' English. :-)
I have a feeling that I can't be totally certain on this issue because that would require being able to read minds. I've never been very good at that!
Anyway, what do you all think?
Thanks,

If so, it is likely an introductory. A question that can be answered with ""yes"" or ""no"" is an interrogation.

490,Where In The App Can I Find My Pin?,Considering this utterance: Where In The App Can I Find My Pin? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What is an Intent?
---------------------
Intents are a way for an app to provide information to the user about something that happened in the app (or in a different app), and what the best way to respond is in that instance. Intents can be used to convey information about the current context of the device or application, including, but not limited to:
* App launch
   * Intent: launch the main app
	* Intent extra: App name
 * App switching
... * Intent Extras: user's location, time
.
The intent is usually passed in when starting an activity (by calling.startActivity(Intent) or.setResult()).
For instance: Intent intent = new Intent(this, MyActivity.class);
// this Intent is used only for starting your activity,
intent.putExtra(""appName"", ""My application name"")); // App's name.
start activity(intent);"

492,Do I Need A Pin,Considering this utterance: Do I Need A Pin What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is this a joke, a serious question, or somewhere in-between? What are the words, and what is their order, that makes it all clear?

If you're like most people, you want to know what the ""right"" answer is. You want someone else to tell you so you don't have to think about it. But, what if you have a choice? Or, in this case, don''t have any other way of finding out? Should you just answer what you think is ""the answer"" (because if the question is ambiguous, how can you possibly know?). Or do you need to make a judgment about context and intent? There's a problem here. We all make decisions on the fly, based on what we think we know, but what are we really doing? Are we thinking or speaking? We are often caught between our minds' inability to answer the questions that are asked of us, on one hand, yet the need we have for a response that lets us off the hook by getting someone to ""make sense of it."" So, who is to say that the real intentions aren't being lost in translation, as if in a dream, we respond to our own questions in the way they were meant to be answered. This is what I want you to take away from this. Do you know yourself? Can you recognize that which makes you unique, which separates you from others? The answers to these questions will tell us what your intentions are.
You, are an individual. There is no one else like you. The fact that other people have their own minds and opinions does not change this fact. Even if they think they are like everyone else, they're not. If you truly knew yourself, there would be NO QUESTION. ""Who am I?"" That is your answer, if your life is a true reflection of your personality. Your answer will determine what kind of life you actually live. Because the answer has already been given by You. When you find yourself caught in an argument about things we don�t need or even believe in, this is proof that you are not fully realizing who you really are; not that there are others like You, just that You are, well, You!
To say, ""We don\'t believe that"" is just another way to avoid facing it; just like ""I don’t know"" really means, I really do not"
493,"If I Need A Pin For My Card, Where Is It Located?","Considering this utterance: If I Need A Pin For My Card, Where Is It Located? What is the intent that best describes it?","1. The intent of this question is to see if a pin for a credit card is located on the card, or in the home? 2. Is the pin located at an ATM, bank, on your card or at your home.
3. A pin is like a combination to a safe, which could be an answer to the problem. In order for the thief to get in, a key or combination is needed. If a card has no pin number, it can be easy for someone to obtain a number through other means and then get into your safe. 3A. An ATM is not always a good place to protect your pin as there is no one to stop a would be thief. You must assume that it is possible for there to be a security issue when using your ATM card at the wrong ATM. At the ATM you are in complete control of your PIN. However, if you use a debit or ATM cash machine card you must be careful of the potential security issues that might occur if PINs are stolen and used for other transactions that are not authorized to use such cards for. 4. Your pin will either be on a chip in your wallet, in a PIN holder and a lock box, the lock may be for your residence or your credit or debit card. 5. Most cards will have a place for you to put the number or code to unlock the machine. This will protect you from the theft of a code because if someone gets a hold of it, you can prevent them from using it for unauthorized transactions on this machine and other ones. 6. Usually your bank will put a limit as to how many times you may use this type of transaction at one time. 7. When you receive the PIN for this or other cards you will most likely get 2-4 digits for example: (2-8)2, (34)6, etc. 8.

494,What Is My Card Pin,Considering this utterance: What Is My Card Pin What is the intent that best describes it?,"If someone gives you this pin, then what kind of response would you expect from them? It’s a pretty basic question, and I”m pretty sure you“ll find a lot of different answers, ranging from the generic, to the silly, depending on your frame of mind. For the purpose of this blog, however, I want to take a look at the most commonly-given answers to these sorts of questions, as well as their most common underlying assumptions and beliefs. If you want a really fun conversation-starter, start the discussion over on the forums!

As a quick refresher…
We‘ve talked about the three major types of people in this community (or, if you like, three types within the general community). The first group is known as “Cards„, meaning that they‚ve received this card as a way of recognizing them, usually through some kind word of appreciation, an act of service, or a gift. Most people that fit this category are fairly well acquainted with the game in some fashion (and some are even competitive players), and will usually talk about things like the mechanics, the meta, tournament results, strategy, etc.
A large number of these players will also recognize the phrase „the rules are simple‹ as being something that applies to all players in the community, while another large minority will see ‚the rulebook› as something to be studied on and followed strictly in order to improve their game. This latter group, though, is somewhat smaller than those who see rules as applicable to them. Still, there‛s always some variation on how this attitude is viewed by the different personalities within our community. Some see it as an excuse to do whatever they want (which, of course, they shouldn‗t). Others see the ruleset as simply a guide to help them improve the way they play. And there are plenty of others for whom it has no place at all. So what is this common assumption about rulebooks (‖and in particular, what are people― beliefs about their use)? Let‟s find out!


First, let‡s take some common responses to this question of what we mean by ‘the cards‣. In a large majority of responses, people are saying ’I just play my deck‏. The way that you play"
495,And What About The Card'S Pin?,Considering this utterance: And What About The Card'S Pin? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I have a strong feeling that it was the intended meaning is: ""What about the card's pin code?"". 
I have heard that this was an expression from the late 1800's (or earlier). Is that what's happening here?

A:
The expression refers to your pin number, not a code.
You could use ""what about"" to describe someone's password, like ""You have what about three seconds.""  But not pin numbers.  A pin can be changed or replaced."
496,About This Card Pin?,Considering this utterance: About This Card Pin? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Do you believe that this card is meant for you or your partner? Does it represent your love for each other or a wish for love, happiness, or luck? A good rule to follow when asking this question is to think about what the other person is saying about this love card. A man may be describing this as a relationship card, something a woman might call a love or happiness card or she may just be saying that she has it but doesn’t know how to use it.

I think this is another card that represents the relationship. It is for the woman to say something like, ‘You are special to me and I want to be with you. You are not my mother or my father or someone I have to take care of. I‘m very lucky to have found you because you are the only one and the person I always wanted in my whole life. If you love me then I will love you too.”
It's a good time to open the heart as we are going through the changes that are happening. So it's ok if we get a little scared, we need to go deeper within our selves. The card shows an open heart and this can mean that we now need more freedom in our lives and we will be feeling good with ourselves which is a new freedom to feel. This can also mean a feeling of expansion and opening up our hearts to more ideas, love and to the world. Our hearts are expanding and so is our view on life, so now we can have a clearer vision for our own happiness and wellbeing."

I'm trying to figure out if there are any real differences between the two versions of the question, or if my wording is just too awkward. I'm leaning to the latter, but that could just be me. :) 
Thanks,
Chris
EDIT: I have a feeling this question was more about semantics and not so much about style. In my experience, if the asker asks how to start, I interpret that as asking about how/when/where to get started. If the original question is ""How do I get a project up and running?"", I think that is a different question (which I haven't asked on Programmers.SE, just not sure if I'll ask it).
This is my first question on SO, so please, feel free to chime in, especially on how I can improve it. Thanks in advance. :-)

500,Does My Pin Come With My Card?,Considering this utterance: Does My Pin Come With My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This utterances:
My Pin Comes With my pin
I'll give you my card, but there will be a fee
You got my number, I'll see you at the party
Are examples of what I would label as an ""implied"" question (implicit question) and an example of ""direct"" and ""indirect"" questions respectively.
How would I classify an utterant like: 
""Your Pin comes with your card""
In this example, what is being implied is: ""What is your pin for?""
However, this type of question is not a question, because it is a statement.   Does the utterate ""your pin comes w/ your ""card""  belong to a different category of statements (or question)?  If so, why?  Also, how can one distinguish this from an 'ordinary' question and a'statement' in general? (i.e. How would a native speaker distinguish between: 1) I will give my credit card to the clerk, when I give it to him; 2) The clerk will take my money, so I can spend it; 3) There's no more money in my account).
(This site does not appear to have any clear guidelines for such things, nor any questions that would address this).  Thanks
UPDATE 1: It seems that it's a good question after all, since it has been marked as a duplicate of an older question: What's the difference between ""questions"" vs. ""statements""?
Also, it seems like one could have a sentence like ""My pin will come with my ticket"" with a slightly different meaning: 'How can you get this (my pin) if you need the ticket (to pay for it)'.  Would such a difference cause it be classified as something other than a ""statement"" (even if it was a direct question):
The meaning of the sentence: Is ""Can you please give me some help"" a request? or a demand? Is it something else?"
501,Where Can I Find The Card Pin?,Considering this utterance: Where Can I Find The Card Pin? What is the intent that best describes it?,"It's about a search for a place to find the card pin. The answer ""Where Can You Find Me?"" doesn't quite fit, since this sentence doesn'y say where the speaker can be found. It should be something like ""What can you do to help me find my lost card?""

This utterances: What Can My Card Go In? and What If? is somewhat a combination of both ""You Can't Find What You're Not Looking For"" and ""If You Don't Know What to Ask, You'll Get No Answer.""
The ""where the object/person/group/entity/place"" is implicit in the sentence and can not be changed or removed without changing the meaning of the utterant.
Examples of ""you can't find what you aren't looking for"":
If you are looking out the window and don't see something, you cannot find your car keys. You simply need to look out of your window. If you want the keys, it must be the case that you were looking outside.  
I'm looking through my desk drawers but cannot seem to discover my keys so must look elsewhere for where my car is. (I think.)
As for 'if you don'e know what to ask, then you're not going to get an answer':
""What if I need a second opinion on this?"" would require that the first opinion is being asked about, thus making it the thing to be examined. 'What's if you had a problem in your mind?' is a valid alternative. ""Is it possible?"" is another. Also, the 'I' is not the one being examined, so it's not a question of 'what is your problem'."
502,Why Isn'T My Pin Available Yet?,Considering this utterance: Why Isn'T My Pin Available Yet? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it a statement, a question, an inquiry, or a complaint? In short - how do you want to be addressed?

For now, I will use this question as a way to help you identify your tone of voice.
The most common way people are heard is through the tone within the words being spoken. We do this by changing the pitch (or frequency of sound) at a given moment of the conversation. The tone is determined by the rate and manner in which we speak. By understanding a person's tone and by listening carefully to what is being said, you will be well equipped when it comes time to ask ""Why Isn't My Product or Service Available?"".
In this blog, we will look at the following:
What is tone?How can the ""tone"" of our voice change our message?Examples of ""tones"" in speech
How does changing one's ""rate"" change the message of that tone or voice? What about the way we ""man"" or ""woman"" the voice
Examples
Example 1 - A man speaking with a woman
A man is talking to a female colleague about something. She looks at her watch and says: ""I need to get to lunch with my husband. You see, he is a doctor and I have to see his practice this afternoon. If you don't have a meeting, perhaps we can talk more."" The man responds by saying: ""...I don' have anything going on. When could we set something up?"" This exchange illustrates the difference between speaking to people as men and speaking as women. It also illustrates that if a man speaks with the female, they will perceive that he (she) is: a) ""interested"" and is wanting to meet with her. b) In a hurry. c) He has no time. In contrast, the woman is speaking about her time and the time of her husband, and she seems to make it very clear that she is not interested in him, that has absolutely no need or interest in meeting with him. To the man, she would appear to say ""My husband has his own schedule just like I do"". But to him she will appear like he does not have time for her, to her he would seem to imply ""You are of no importance"".
This is an example of a ""difficult"" tone to use when addressing a group of people
If someone is complaining a"
503,Is My Pin Located On My Account Somewhere?,Considering this utterance: Is My Pin Located On My Account Somewhere? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is he looking for information, or he's seeking a pin for the website? And, more importantly, does it matter?
There are many ways to approach this question. I'll give two.
Method 1
First, ask the user what he wants. Does he want to look for a site pin? Does the pin have to be on his account, and if so, do they need to know which one? If they want information about the account/accounts, are they looking to check on information? The answers will give insight into the users' intents. In the event they don't get a straight answer, you could offer them the opportunity to add a comment. This may or may not solve their problem. It gives their answer more context. If not, let them know. Then move on to the next question, to keep the conversation fresh. You've given the customer some information and shown you care about their needs. Even if you haven't, it doesn't hurt to ask about any particular need or to acknowledge a need they might have overlooked. The conversation will be better for it. 
Second, give some examples. For example, if he doesn’t know about his pin, he might not recognize it or might be confused. Or it might just be an account that he no longer uses. By showing he understands what they are asking about, the likelihood that they'll get the information they seek is increased. They'll understand you. Also, by showing that you‘d like to help, they‚ll feel more comfortable coming back when they have more questions. Asking if there are any other questions and offering a phone number are great ways of making this approach feel conversational. A comment to them that explains something about you or your company helps establish trust. And a few of the ways you've already mentioned – asking if they would like another type of information – shows you want them to have success when using your services. Finally, having a conversation, rather then a one-line answer can help the caller feel that his needs weren't forgotten, even if the answer is ‚no'.
Note on the phone: This might need a bit of trial-and-error to find the right tone and method. Ask yourself, ""Do I want the person on my call to feel as if I'm doing them a favor?"" Do you really want that? Do I"
504,"Please Help In Finding My Card Pin, Thank You!","Considering this utterance: Please Help In Finding My Card Pin, Thank You! What is the intent that best describes it?","I can think of 3 possibilities:
1) As an apology for being too much of a pushover and allowing some guy to do my card pin
2) as an insult to the person asking the question
3) To get attention
There should be at least one that I missed.
The correct answer is ""3."" ""1"" seems too apologetic, and ""2"" implies a lack of self control. However, ""4"" can be read to imply a bit of humor at the expense of the original speaker. ""5"" may suggest that ""this is not a question you should have asked."""
505,Where Is My Pin Number Located?,Considering this utterance: Where Is My Pin Number Located? What is the intent that best describes it?,"It is best to use the verb and noun phrase ‘is located’ in this type of sentence. It is less clear to me why “the location of the pin number” might be included as part of ”Where is my pin Number located?“
But even if that is part the sentence, I think it is better to say: ’Where my PIN number is located, (as) I would know where to look to find it.
I am not sure whether this is a question of English, grammar or syntax. But this question is not about English."
506,I Still Don'T Have My Pin.,Considering this utterance: I Still Don'T Have My Pin. What is the intent that best describes it?,"I want to know because this sounds like a common phrase people use to express an idea, and my guess is that this could be a new type of phrase.

A:
– I still don't know the password  I am not a password genius 
   – It's easy once you get the knack.  A  simple thing. Once learned, it never leaves."
507,So What About The Card Pin?,Considering this utterance: So What About The Card Pin? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I don't know if I could call it 'intention', it's just something I did. I'm pretty sure people don’t think of it as “intention”. It‘s just a habit that came about in the last year. When I go to bed I have the feeling of ‘I have to do x“ and then I do do.
That‟s all, really. —
„
This is probably the best way to describe your approach to language in general I think,
and how you use language with such intention. You just do it. The habit is like your'mantra' in a way. There you're just following the habit. And this is what I love about you, as a teacher. How you give such detailed explanations and descriptions. So, it‹s really just like following a „manta, mantra‰ (I had the same feeling about a 'word' and 'card pin' before). I don' know, maybe I'll have it in my mind after I've read your explanations a few more times, but right now I feel something like this. ‚That I can't understand how someone can think like that'... And that's also a good point! I mean, what are people thinking when they come up with ideas like 'So What about the card pin?' or 'What is going on with the ""intention""?'... Because it seems to me very strange if someone would say: I would only call that a word that is not spoken by anyone. That would be the most interesting answer to that question. But, then again... I am really happy that you are a person who can explain things in such detail like you did before. Thank you very much!"
508,I Cannot Locate The Card Pin.,Considering this utterance: I Cannot Locate The Card Pin. What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:
[Edit] After the comment, I've added some more examples and added a more thorough version of this answer to cover the cases where there may be a difference in what is meant.
I believe in all cases the person is asking for what he/she is doing or what action is expected next, i.e. I think in this context the meaning is ""I tried looking for it but cannot locate the card pin"".
However, there seems to be more than one different way to answer this question: there can be different ""means/meant"", i,e, the exact same way of asking can get different answers depending on how the sentence was asked, or the way in which the answer was given. The two answers below try to capture this nuance. It will be hard to find a single answer which captures all the various forms of the question/answer, but the example below, using two different ways of speaking, shows the range of possible responses: 
Case 1: Direct, plain English version
John: Do you have a card with me?   => Means: Are you doing the task or do you need assistance to complete the action? (You can give the same response without using'me'.)
Jane: Me, have you got a 'card with you'? => Means: You are asking me whether you do it yourself or whether I do. (It is not a direct question, it is an indirect question)."
509,I Need My Pin,Considering this utterance: I Need My Pin What is the intent that best describes it?,"If you guessed “to enter into an exchange with another person” that is correct. The ‘I’ in the sentence ” I need my pin“ suggests there is an I that exists in order to have the pin; and as far as we can tell, he does not intend to get one. However, this can be easily mistaken. If a person intends to enter an „I need‟ to another ‟I,„ they might actually be looking for a replacement I. This means that the person might intend not to actually get the pins in question.

In order not be confused by this, it is important to know how to recognize a direct I-I construction in a language. A direct ’I-‘ I construction is one in which the I is used in its normal role and the direct object is a pronoun that refers to that I in their normal † role‡, and therefore, indicates the same I as the one described in I want and need. For example:
 I want my book.‚ ‚I think my dog› is hungry‛  ‹ I know he is. ‹ I like my horse. He has a nice coat. (This is not in strict order)
The examples ‖‖ represent the ‗I ‡‰ in each sentence. It is often hard for people who are not native speakers to realize the difference between I and it because of the fact that both the pronoun I and the noun it describe the exact same entity, so when we use either of them in this sense, we are actually pointing to the very same thing
Here is some advice to help you distinguish the different meanings of I:

 If I say ″I am in charge″ I am talking about myself in some sense; but if I said ′‏I′, to me I refer to a group, organization or government; if there was such an entity. In this case the word I acts as an abbreviation for an abstraction ‏ ‪‬  such as government, an institution, a company, etc.

 In the first example ※‭‮the speaker wants his  or her  dog;‌ and I think it․ I mean the speaker is thinking about that dog himself. There for"
510,Where Can I Find My Pin?,Considering this utterance: Where Can I Find My Pin? What is the intent that best describes it?,"A person who is searching for information on a product, service, or topic that he/she does not yet know? This is a great example of the use of pronouns in spoken English. You do that all the time without thinking about it. We talk about things, people, and places using pronouns.
A great way to improve and to be more persuasive is to learn how to express yourself in a more positive way, using more adjectives and adverbs when you write as it will make you sound more confident and positive. For example, “The car looks amazing” is much better than ” My car is not bad.“
""It is in my nature to do a kind thing, because it is good to have a good nature."" (Rainer Maria Rilke) ""Good friends are the grace and favor of life.""(Will Rogers) If you know you have something to hide, why do you think you should be the one to tell them? You may be hiding something, so don't be that person."
511,When Do I Receive My Pin,Considering this utterance: When Do I Receive My Pin What is the intent that best describes it?,"The answer is: when do I receive my pin or password?

I would say, in general, this is a very bad idea. It is not the best of ideas. You don’t “have” your pin. There is no sense in which you“lose․‘‹„›‚‡†‧•‰ your PIN. Your PIN is simply a number that has been allocated to you.
You don't ‘receive your password; your username is your ”password‭. So when you receive your ""password""‬, it is just an allocated number, which is then associated with your account."
512,Help Me Find My Card Pin!,Considering this utterance: Help Me Find My Card Pin! What is the intent that best describes it?,A) Help a friend find the card pin. B) Give a card to the pin owner. C) Pin a lost card. D) Show the owner of the lost pin a missing card
513,Is Pin Delivered Separately?,Considering this utterance: Is Pin Delivered Separately? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is the speaker saying “I am delivering Pin, but there is no one else to deliver it”… ‘I was doing this task’…‘When Pin arrives, it will be delivered to me.“

I think the ’intent‼ is that the pin will not arrive at the door unless the delivery person arrives. This is a common construction. In fact, I think I used it in the first paragraph of this answer.
The intent is to express surprise. It is not as if ”it is impossible that pin arrive without the driver. That is what is surprising. ‭The speaker knows that pins are usually delivered in packages, ‬and they are delivered by the company‟s courier service. The speaker is surprised. They cannot deliver something that is already delivered."
514,I Can Not Find My Card Pin.,Considering this utterance: I Can Not Find My Card Pin. What is the intent that best describes it?,"If you read the title, then you might think I am trying to find something, but I really am not, my question is, what kind of Intent is behind the statement in the first place.
I tried researching online, I was thinking that the card is meant to be a pin, the pin is supposed to help you find it, so I assumed its a search Intent, maybe I mis-interpreted. 
Is there any rule about this one? If so, please share. Thanks. :)
Edit:
This is not the same question as in this post, it is more about the Intent behind a statement. The statement there I believe can be considered as an instruction, while the question here is about Intent and the meaning behind. They might look similar but the former is a question about an actual statement that is made by a person, and it contains a noun phrase and another statement, whereas the latter focuses on the sentence as whole, which can contain a verb or even an adverb, like ""to find"".
Thanks for reading it :).
PS: This question might come as somewhat odd, though I think the explanation behind it might be useful to other people. I might have some misunderstanding about how to make Intentions in NLG. It might sound as ""what a user wants to achieve""? Or ""What is something about it?"". But really I want to know how people generally interpret Intents that might help me improve my grammar and punctuation skill. If you know any good book on that, or have any resources to link me up, would be great. ;)
Cheers. ^^
P.S.: Sorry for any mistake if you found some. Thank you. :D
Update: Thank all of you for the answer. And if anyone has any recommendations to read, let me know, since I will definitely need to check them out in a near future :P
Thank you again. Hope to see your answers again in my next question. Bye! :)   :0)

[UPDATE]
Ok, Thank everyone for answering, this is really helpful. But if I wanted to ask you more details: What exactly is this kind or Intent? Can you give some examples of each of the three? What are they used for? Thanks! ^-^  I have read your comments but maybe there are many types"
515,What Do I Need To Do For A Pin?,Considering this utterance: What Do I Need To Do For A Pin? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What does the speaker want to communicate?

What would be an appropriate follow up? If the original speaker had not finished the thought, do you wish to extend and complete the conversation or just say it again in different words? Do they need help finding a pin or do they know the pin is not available? The follow ups are designed to get the right answers and to complete their thoughts.
You do not have to know everything in advance. You do need to understand the basic intent behind each phrase to be able to follow a conversation. 
The purpose of communication is for a person to obtain a message or intent from a communication. To do that correctly, you can listen carefully, read the subtext of phrases, and understand how each sentence is linked to the one before and after to form a chain. If you do understand all of those connections, then you are good to go."
516,Why Can'T I Find My Pin?,Considering this utterance: Why Can'T I Find My Pin? What is the intent that best describes it?,"A. To find your pin B. Pin you have lost C. I have misplaced my pin D. You can't find my lost pin

Why can I find it with a lost and found box? You know the lost, found or lost & found boxes are just that.
A box just to put stuff out and get stuff back
Or a box that has found stuff in it for you to find. Or it can have nothing in is, but it is where you put things you want to be easy to get to. And it could be empty of things. Like a closet or a kitchen. The closet could have the toys that you forgot about in there or it might be an old room full of boxes. It could even be a garage. A garage has lots of stuff that is in the garage, like lawn mowers and lawn and garden stuffs to name a few, and it has the house stuff like tools and clothes. (It might have a washer and dryer in a basement of a house. That's where your clothes go after getting washed.)
The lost could include things like, your keys, the book you are reading, a wallet, some change or maybe a toy and you lost it. So you get a new or an existing box and put the found item inside it, then write down where it went, who found it or who else has it and who is suppose to have it before you can put it in with the rest of your stuff. Just like the people you know. If they have your book, wallet or keys. When you find them, you may give them a piece of paper with ""Found"" on the outside with your name and contact info on it so that they can give it to the person who has lost that item. But if they don't know who they are, what is their name or where they live you might just give the piece or paper to a police officer or to your parent or guardian. They are supposed to give your lost or found to you and your parents can take it back if the owner doesn't do it right away. This way you don' want a lot of the stuff to walk away and never be found again. Especially your money or your mom's or dad's money. Maybe it will be your favorite toy, or favorite food or even your baby blanket. There is nothing wrong with asking someone before giving them back the toy"

What is the intent that best describes it?,"Do You Make A Lot of Money Using MasterCard? – I’m not really looking for a personal opinion here, but rather the answer to the question, do you make more money using Master-Card vs Visa. Or, is it a good idea to use either? Let‟s assume the reader of this question is a business owner, and the person answering needs to recommend the best credit card.
It‚Äôs very easy to make a simple, single-word answer, like ‚“Yes”› or “No‹. So I will take you on a short journey, in order to get a multi-facetted view of credit cards.

519,Is It Possible To Get A Visa Here?,Considering this utterance: Is It Possible To Get A Visa Here? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The answer depends upon the context. A visa here in the U.S. means, Is it possible for a foreigner to visit here? Or Is is possible to apply for an e-visa here before a visit? There is nothing wrong in asking such question. The best way to get the answer is to contact a U S Consulate or a local U visa specialist. But, let's go further and look at the possible answers:

Is it Possible to Get a Visa?
There are many people who come here, and they apply and get a visa. Then they go back home. So, it is not possible.
Does the Question Mean Is a Permit Obtainable? If it does, what kind of permit is this? How do you obtain one? It depends, again, on context and intent. You can find information online. Is this your case? Are you looking at a ""Visa on Arrival"" or an ""E-VISA""?
A ""Visas on arrival"" allows you to stay in this country and apply, in person before you visit, for the necessary permission to come to the USA. There may be a fee for this service. This question is a good one as you look for information on getting your visa on arriving here. Read more
An ""e- visa"" is available to people, like yourself, who want to travel to this land but do not want a paper visa and the inconvenience that it entails. They are obtained for up to 5 years at an office outside the United States (usually in London or Dubai) on a computer, by filling out forms available on the internet, paying fees and providing the required documents. For that you need to know how and where to access such a service, since it may exist on your computer or may have to be downloaded. It will be up you, to learn about such information. An e visa is for those people whose stay is planned and who have already planned their trip. (There is some information and an interesting site about this here: How much is visa fees in U K and USA and which are the countries where visa-free travel is allowed) This is an easy one. If, however, you have a long stay planned, then a passport stamp may help you and is cheap and can be obtained through local embassies and consulates. Again, depending on what is your intent, is it"

What is the intent that best describes it?,"For example, you can use this to ask the user what the next step is after clicking the button below the field. You can also use it to say “Here’s how you do that.”, as in this example:

How can I top up my account with a card?
Here's how to do it.
You need to know your PIN and your phone number. When you have both you're ready to go."
521,Where Is My Money I Was Using My Card And It Disappeared,Considering this utterance: Where Is My Money I Was Using My Card And It Disappeared What is the intent that best describes it?,"What does your gut instinct tell you?

For example, if it’s a business communication, the tone might be one of a sales presentation, where intent is to persuade, inform, or persuade (to get the sale).
If it is a personal communication from a friend or family member, it may be intended to provide support or comfort.
When is communication appropriate? It‘s not always possible to know in advance. When do you want to say something? The best rule of thumb is: if you think so, say it. Be aware of body language, facial expression, posture and voice inflection. How can your audience know? Pay attention to how you are saying it and how your listener is responding. Use the above techniques to help you understand your intent and then you can make a good guess as to what you meant to communicate."
522,How Can I Top Up By Card?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Top Up By Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The answer is:
I'm going to pay by card.
This is an adverbial phrase in the sentence above. It doesn't directly modify the verb pay, though it could be used as such: “How can I top up my card?”, ‘ ”How to top it up? I've run out of money,’ ’What can you do? Your card is out or you're overdrawn.'
Adverbs are words that function as adjectives or adverbs. They're usually found in English at the end of a sentence and describe a verb, adjective, or other ad-verb, but they can stand alone or they may modify another adver-bar. In the following sentences, the words highlighted in bold are adverts:.The following sections offer more information about adverting. This section focuses on adverbal phrases. An adword is a phrase that adheres to the grammar rules of an adjective: a noun, an infinitive, a preposition, and a pronoun. Adverbs can be thought of as a group that are usually at or close to verbs.Adverberbs modify verbs, adject, ad verbs or interjections. You can also think of adversives as words you use to emphasize the meaning of the subject of your sentence. As far as adjectives, they are the modifiers or modifiers in adwords. When an -er verb ends in -ed, you can say that the ad verb modifies the word or verb you ad.For example, in this sentence, I'm using the adjective ad in front of it:.
Here is another example: When you want something in large quantity, say you, You have to take a vacation. (How about a few of you?) Or maybe, She wanted to make an investment in it.Or, How about I just say, Don't ask. He is not here because he just left.This ad, like all ad words, is used for emphasis and is usually a strong word with several syllables.It has a special place when it comes to punctuation. Most people do not want to interrupt an important thought by adding a period at that place. But when you are using an adjectival phrase or using a compound noun such as, ""The last thing she ever expected to see was her husband of fifty years standing right in back of her"
523,What Is The Process For Using My Credit Card To Transfer Money?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Process For Using My Credit Card To Transfer Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I don’t know the specific process, but I do know I have to use a credit or debit card. My credit card will be used for the transaction, and I‘ll probably have a bank account in my name too.
My sister told me, “The money will go from your account into your sister‟s account when the transfer is completed. You will receive an email when that happens, so that”s where you will need to be. I don't know how long it will take, it‽s a long time for me to get the money from her,“ but she said once it does, ""it's not very difficult to transfer it to me.‭"".
What do you think is her intent here? Am I misinterpreting it or is this what she‚Äôs really saying? I feel this is really helpful to know, what is our process? If it helps, she has a phone and a computer. She will use both, if her computer gets stolen, that will not help her because she wouldn‰Ûªt be able to make an online transaction. It will still be a hassle to find a physical branch so she can do the physical transaction and then have an issue with it being stolen too, since I can‹t see anything about the bank on my phone, etc. Thanks!"
524,How Do I Top Up My Card Using Your App? I'M New To This.,Considering this utterance: How Do I Top Up My Card Using Your App? I'M New To This. What is the intent that best describes it?,"What would you expect to happen after you click on the button? What do you think are all of the things going through your mind at that moment? You may have thought ""Oh, I'll just make a quick $25 deposit, and then when we finish talking on Skype, the transfer will be completed."" How is it possible that the user would have all that thought in only a split second? It's because the buttons were designed to create a specific action.
""How do I top-up my card"" is a very common phrase in the world, we know what happens after the question is asked. So, it's very unlikely that you'll have any uncertainty about what the ""I'll top up my account"" button will do. 
In a way, this is just an example of an extremely well-designed button. ""Top-Up"" means ""top-of-the-line,"" ""excellent,"" or ""perfect."" The phrase ""how do i top the tank of water"" can be interpreted as ""How is water in my tank?"""

528,Use Credit Card To Transfer Money,Considering this utterance: Use Credit Card To Transfer Money What is the intent that best describes it?,"I can think of many other utterances or sentences that convey the same or similar intent. For example, I may say: I will pay you for the car with the credit card. The difference in the above two utterences is that the second one is a request, while the first one describes a future action. We use the word ask in this sense: The word is being used here in its basic definition, but I would like to make the point here (to those unfamiliar) that it doesn’t have to mean literally asking somebody else for whatever we have in mind. It can include more than just requesting another to do something. I am merely using it to emphasize that I‘m saying in a literal sense that you can‚ use your credit cards to transfer the money.

To give an example: If I were to ask you “Do you want another beer?” or ”Would you like another beverage? ’ (or ask) ‘ Do you still have a credit
“. You might answer: „I‟m good with that.„ If you had a beer or beverage, you are in fact answering the request to consume the beverage. If the question or remark is about money, then you may not literally be asking another person for money but the meaning would still be the one I just described in my previous sentence. However, if I was talking about a gift card as I did above, the ‚request‛ would be very literal. This is because a †gift card‬ is only used for purchases. But even in that case, it could be a metaphor, because it might also be understood as a question as to whether you would use it, or it can be about whether the gift is one you‪ ‬can‫ ‫accept‭. There is a question‧here‣ as‥to․‖whether‡› the gifts you are‏ offered—‹are ‹truly―welcomed‍‰by you.† And†there‮may be something‌about the‒offer ​that suggests a refusal in your response.

The answer is: What Is An Email Account Topup. It can mean different things depending on the context. When I am reading that sentence, I understand that this person wants to know how do some friends top up an account. I also understand the second and third options because they seem to be the most popular. However, the last option How do my friends to top my account? is a bit strange and unusual because normally friends can top each other. So, if you were to ask me this question I would say the first option because the other options seem like they don’t really make sense. Therefore, this is my answer. This is what I will tell you if I wanted to explain this type of question. You may want to add your answer if it would help someone else. Please add the explanation if anyone has questions or problems. If there are not any, you can go on to the next question and I can continue with the rest of the list.

530,"I Followed The Instructions To Transfer Money Using My Card, But Then The Money Disappeared And I Don'T Know What Happened.","Considering this utterance: I Followed The Instructions To Transfer Money Using My Card, But Then The Money Disappeared And I Don'T Know What Happened. What is the intent that best describes it?","A:
As the first part of the utterances, I follow the instructions to transfer money using my card, has two main intents. The first one is to explain, the second intent is for a question. Both are in present tense.
I Follow the Instructions to (do something with my cards) = (I did the action by following the instruction of doing something)
So I did I, which means I've done the job. However, because of no object in the sentence, we can't use a definite article as a subject. (the same reason why the question I don't know,... don;t know). Because of not the article, it has a non-finite form. This means the subject is a verb and it can be the present or past. I do I means that I have done this action, or I didn't, but I know this is an event in past as the main subject of this sentence is ""I"". So I Did It means, that's the same, and ""do"" is in simple present. 
But we don know what happened after that. So the next question is where did it go. It can mean: What did happen?  or, What happened afterwards?"

532,How Can I Top Up?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Top Up? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This utterances is from the book The Art of the Everyday, The Life-Changing Wisdom of Simple Living
by the famous American psychologist, Dr Wayne Dyer. This book is written with the aim to help the readers and the authors themselves change the way they think and live. It is also an autobiography of his own life story. So if you are a follower of Dr Dyers' writings, you will be familiar with this book (even if I do not know you or if it was you who introduced this wonderful book to me).
I think I have read some of this books already. I love Dr. Dyr's writing style. He makes it so simple that it is possible to understand even if the reader is not familiar to psychology or life. If you love this kind of books, it might be an easy read too!
Anyway, today I am going to talk a bit about this quote from this famous book:
""When the words 'How can I top up, or increase, my supply of positive emotions?' pop into my mind, I immediately begin to ruminate: 'I don't feel much love or gratitude. But then what would be my problem?' The moment I think this way, an insidious negative pattern forms: I start to feel bad for myself, for being so empty of love. Then I feel like a failure for not having more love in my life, so I begin thinking about my mistakes, problems and failures.
'I'm not sure this is how love and gratitude work,' I say to myself.""
In my opinion, the quote above explains that when we ask how to be happier, we are asking the wrong question. In fact, if we really want to live a life filled with joy, then it does not matter how we feel or what we think. How we live our life is what matters the most. We can only be happy if what is living inside us agrees (or coincides!) with what living outside is doing. As I mentioned, this sounds very simple, but it took me some years to realize what I was talking about. (I am still learning everyday) I just hope that in the following, some insights of mine may be helpful to you. And as a final note, in case you wonder what do I mean by ""living inside"", I will tell you that I consider that the heart is where we have to start looking for what makes us happy"

The door is open. The company is doing a service for you. That makes the

makes sense to offer my personal bank information. It is not a matter of
secrecy, it is a privacy issue. I do not have to worry about whether a bank

535,How Do I Transfer Money Using A Credit Card?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Transfer Money Using A Credit Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it:
[I] I will transfer money using a credit card.
or 
 [II] My bank will give me cash to transfer the money on my creditcard.  ?
Which is it and why is that?  I want to ensure I give the best possible answer. Thanks

A:

 How do I transfer $1000 using credit cards? is a question of what you mean by the phrase ""transfer money"".  In the US, when banks want a customer to pay for goods or services, there is usually a charge which is added to the bill and then transferred to a ""credit card"" account. This charge is often called a transaction fee. These transaction fees are often calculated on a percentage of the transaction, and so you might pay a flat fee $10 to have the bank's ""transaction processing department"" move $100 of money from one customer's account to another. Or the fee might be a function of some other variable, such as the length of time since the previous transaction was made or the type of transaction. The term ""money moved"" can sometimes mean different things, too. If you are a merchant, the merchant may move money out of his or her account into a bank account, in order to obtain cash from a check or a gift card, to be used for the next purchase. In such cases, it might not be quite accurate to call it ""the transfer of funds from my bank to yours."" 

 In that case, ""How do you transfer 100 bucks from account A to account B?"" is also a good question. It is possible to use a card (which may take the form of an American Express card or an Amex credit or debit card) in a manner that looks like a payment for a service. You could pay $5 for this service and $35, for instance, at a store, but then you would not receive the goods and the store would pay the $55 to itself. To do this is called ""payment for service"" and is very common for things like utility bills, telephone bills and many retail purchases. ""Transferring"" money like this, using your card but without the service provided by a retail merchant (who might, after all, want your money because they want the merchandise and do not want you walking out empty handed) may be called an ""ACH transfer"" or ""funds transfer"
536,Can I Give My Friends Access To My Account So They Can Top It Up For Me?,Considering this utterance: Can I Give My Friends Access To My Account So They Can Top It Up For Me?

537,"I Did A Top-Up, But I'M Not Seeing It In My Wallet Yet.","Considering this utterance: I Did A Top-Up, But I'M Not Seeing It In My Wallet Yet. What is the intent that best describes it?","The best way to understand it is to put ourselves into the mind of someone who has just made the transaction, but doesn't see their transaction yet in their wallet... i.e. we are looking down at our device, and see the receipt on screen and hear the speaker say ""I did a top-up, I don't think I'll see it in my wallet yet. 
In this case, as far as I am concerned in the question, the most natural interpretation would be ""It's my intention to use the term ""top-off"" for this purpose. I want to make that clear because some of the more common interpretations don’t make sense:

I've done a transaction. It doesn‘t yet show up in wallet, so what?
(I didn't make a credit transaction.) I haven't made one yet, what do I mean? It's up to date.
Is it my topup (I can't top my credit)?
The transaction is done, it's been confirmed. Now what I'm going to do with it."
538,"I Know I Entered The Right Info, But My Top Up Isn'T In My Balance","Considering this utterance: I Know I Entered The Right Info, But My Top Up Isn'T In My Balance What is the intent that best describes it?","A:
In this case, the question is not just asking “What” is in a particular balance? It’s asking for an entire list.
You cannot give a list when you say ‘My top up is [not] in my balance‏, because this means:  
- My __________ is   in  my _____ (list of the things you are thinking of)
If I were to give such a sentence, I would have to say: 
 - - I Know‍(that is, my knowledge is complete) “[the thing you were thinking about] is (not) present in (the list of things I just told you about).
This sentence is called the „Yes/No Question‹, or the Question-Form: It consists of a verb (‘to know›) and a subject and an object, like these, with a question mark. ∗
It looks like: ∙ ∑∩∈∘⌿∏
[1]  [subject]‚ [verb] [object] ‹[question mark]
The first thing about the sentence ‚„I KNOW I entered the right info, but my top-up is/is not in balance. Is not present※ ‑ is a grammatical structure called a ‛sentence-end particle‡; [see] this [link]. This particle marks a new sentence and introduces the idea of doubt, uncertainty, doubtfulness, etc. [This] article [explains] it [better] than [this] one [did].[‮] In the case of ′‛my‫[top up] isn‪'t in【my balance]is【present‬ in [my]【balance}․
So in our case: the subject is ‡I‖ the verb is KNOW‥and the object is′'my top up isn[present in] my【top-down‭ balance'

539,Will My Friend Be Able To Top Off My Account?,Considering this utterance: Will My Friend Be Able To Top Off My Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"(You may wish to consider the alternative: How Will This Affect My Business? )

What is The Message?
The message is that the friend or acquaintance is going to do something that is beneficial to them — something, perhaps, that has been requested to be done (by you or the other person). They are going do so.
And this is what I mean by:
In this context, the words: “Will they?” express a conditional. That is, you would have to know if it is true, for the conditional statement to make sense. For example: If it had not been raining, I would not have been able to go to work. Or if you were not a lawyer, would you be able get a legal job? The condition of the statement is something you do not know until you know the answer to the question. In the previous examples, it could be that rain would continue for another 24 hours, or that you will not be a doctor by the time you retire. So, what the person is ‘thinking’ is not known at this time. They do realize, probably, they do know about their ability to top-off an account. But, is it true? Will they be willing to pay, even though I may not ask them (because I am sure they will)? Will this benefit them? I do have their money (and that makes them my ”friend“, as I have agreed to accept it).
But, do they have any other means to fund the top off? They may have other debts that take priority. Will I be allowed to continue to give this person more of my hard earned money, and at the same time, be charged interest for doing so? Is that fair to others who have an obligation to repay the loan? These are important questions that may arise. I will discuss them later, when we are more familiar with the concept of conditions."
540,Is There A Way To Transfer Funds Directly From My Card?,Considering this utterance: Is There A Way To Transfer Funds Directly From My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"It could be that you think about the transaction as something like a bill payment or an electronic transfer from a checking account. But is this the best way to think of it. It could just as easily be thought of as: a direct transfer to an IRA or another type of retirement account or investment property. Either way, the answer would be yes.
For the past several years, you have been able to transfer funds directly from your credit card and debit card to a Roth IRA, a traditional IRA, or a Rollover IRA. (You can also transfer a rollover from one account to another or from an existing IRA to your new account.)
A credit or debit transfer (sometimes referred to as a “charge” transfer ) is a transfer of funds between accounts, either from the source account (from which the funds are being withdrawn or credited to) to the destination account, or vice versa. There are essentially two types of charge transfers:
• Charge card transactions – These transfers happen automatically each time you charge an item to or withdraw funds from that card. They are handled entirely by the issuing bank. The funds that are automatically transferred are usually from checking accounts. You may be eligible to make charge card transfers for a specific purpose, like to fund a vacation or pay for your college tuition. In most cases, this type and size of transfer must be made on a regular basis, typically monthly or quarterly. When this happens, it does not affect the credit limit associated with the card or the amount of credit available at the time the transfers are performed. However, if you don’t make payments or use the balance on the account in a timely fashion, your account balance will be reduced by that amount. So, for example, in order to prevent the charge from being ‘bounced‘ (the bank notifying the original cardholder that the payment is not received and will not be credited), or for any other reason, we recommend that these transactions not exceed $1,000 monthly. If you use an automatic bank deposit option, such as direct account transfer, those funds will automatically be deposited in your checking or savings account after the transfer has been completed.

What is the intent that best describes it?","If you answered: You tried to top up using your card, but now the money just disappeared, then you are probably guilty of a technical glitch at a payment system.

However, it could also be the result of fraud or a scam attempt, especially for a non-local merchant. For the sake of this example, let’s assume this nonlocal seller is a business from India that has been trying to grow their business overseas through e-commerce channels. In the first instance, the most likely reason why their sales have suddenly fallen off a cliff is because of fraudulent activities by customers who were buying the same products but paying from fake (i.e. stolen) cards or from card skimmers. It could be a customer using a card with a stolen CVV or an individual trying their luck with one of the growing number of credit card cloning scams that are out there. The second most probable reason is that of scammers who are actively and systematically scanning merchant websites for the purpose of identifying any vulnerabilities that they can capitalize on. They are looking for merchants that rely on payment systems and/or credit cards and are specifically looking to compromise these systems to the maximum extent possible by emptying out a merchant‘s credit limit or transferring funds out of their accounts before a transaction is finalized. Scammers have a lot of time on their hands and they spend it systematically searching online for potential targets. And, of course, there are the obvious criminals who have the technical skills or know-how to access and compromise payment processing systems. All of these fraudsters are after one thing: the sale!

This is an example of the second way a question can be used to ask for a transfer.
We'll talk about all three ways of asking for transfer in a moment. But first
let's talk a little bit about how the question is asked. It is a sentence
that begins with the verb phrase: ""Can You?""
To ask if you can do something is to put a yes or no question mark at the
beginning of a verb that describes what you want to do. In this case, ""you"":
""Can you use... to transfer money""
Or ""can you get...?"" In these cases, you might add a preposition before the word,
and change ""get"" to ""to get.""
For example:
Can my bank account be transferred from your bank to mine? Or: Can my
account be moved from one company to another? Is it possible to get a refund? Do you
know anyone in this city? Are you in need of money? Can you go to your
credit card company and get the money back? ""Do you know where this store is?"" ""Could
you call me a cab?"" Or even: Will you help me? You're in my apartment
now. Can I borrow one of your coats? Could I talk to you about
something private?"" Can we use your credit card this
week? Would you like to have dinner with me?"" Are there
anybody who needs your help? If I had money, could this place be free? Does
he need help now? What's wrong with him?"" If you don't know
the answer to one or more of these questions, ask it another way. ""What
can I do to help you?"" You might also say
to ask your question in such a way that it can only
be answered truthfully, by using the present tense. You could say something like this: Are
there any programs to assist students who have fallen behind? Will this new system change
a lot of things around here?"" To ask what will happen is: To find out what
is going to happen next is called asking about the future. To know how we can help is
not to know the answer. We can't always know what's going

In this case, it‘s:
I have added money to my account, so that the others are able to do the same.
If I were the user, I would probably think this was the answer: “Yes”. I“d be happy to share my bank account details with people I trust and feel comfortable with. It makes sense, right? It‟s a common request in the world of apps — we„re all comfortable sharing information (like our phone number, location, and email address); we understand that it increases trust, allows us to collaborate, helps us find friends, etc. We‰re comfortable enough with it that we expect apps (such as social media apps) to give us the option.

We expect that sharing account information will be easy enough that even if it hasn t been requested before, we should still be able offer the request, when it makes perfect sense and seems like it would be a good idea.

However, when we look at a few different examples, we notice that the CSPs can also top-up the account holder’s bank account, top him up on a prepaid mobile or credit card, or just top his account up. We can observe that this intent is shared by multiple domains. So, this is an utterable intent. However, if we were to say, “Who Else can Top up my Cignature account”, will we be talking about the same domain? This might confuse the users and the machine alike. The machine has the knowledge to identify whether or not the utter is directed towards a CIG account or a credit account but the user might think otherwise. Hence, the first intent can be a shared intent with multiple domain. It is because the word ‘Who‘, in this instance, is a personal pronoun. There“s nobody else like me.

I think what happened to you is because of one of the following reasons:
The customer wants you to top up a card without telling you that you need the authorization or has already been approved to do so. In this case, if you top it up, you can top-up an active card but not inactive one. That is why the card doesn't have enough money to cover the topup amount. Another important reason is to get some cash from the bank to give to the other customer in the restaurant. This customer may have been sitting there for some time without anything but when you give them the cash. You give him or her more than your toplimit so that they'll be able to pay and you get the rest of their money. If that's the case then the transaction has completed.

A third possibility is to ask a friend or relative to wire the funds through the mail or have it wire-transferred. Either way, you have to use a check to pay for the service and you won‚t have your money for 30 days. If you go this route with checks, it is important that you keep track of what you deposit, where it goes, and the fees involved.

553,My Friends Want To Top Up My Account,Considering this utterance: My Friends Want To Top Up My Account What is the intent that best describes it?,"Do you understand this statement?

Do you know what your friends want? Why did they ask you to top up their account? Did you get the message? You might think: “What an interesting question to ask a person.” The answers you give to your questions, even to yourself, can have very powerful consequences for the person who asks you those questions. You can answer with a positive intent or a negative intent, and in your answers to others you have the power to build or destroy their self-esteem, their confidence, or their relationship to you. That question you answer is your first step to making yourself the hero or the victim of their life. I am going to show you what that is, because the answers we make to the questions we ask have power beyond measure.
The question: What Did Your Friends Do? or What Do Friends Think Your Intent Is? is really about the meaning of the words ‘Friends,’ ’What, ” and ‚Intent. „
I have found a very strong association between people who ask this question and people with low levels of self esteem, self confidence and self belief. Those who are high on self love have no trouble answering the question because it has no power over them. They will always ask themselves: Am I right, who is right? They do not have to look outside for guidance when they are not certain of themselves. Instead of asking themselves questions like this: Do I know them?, Do they have money?, Why are they asking me? and How do they know they can trust me?, those with self pride and confidence have already answered those very questions and they simply ask: How does this make me look? The questions they should ask instead are: Who am I?, Where do I go from here, When will this be over? and Will this get better or worse? This is a simple question with an extraordinary answer. If you want to find out: Have I lost my friends? What do my Friends think? then that question is for you!
Let‘s begin:
How does your friend or your best Friend see you? How did your Friend look at you after you answered the above question? Was your response the same as her/his view of you or is it different? If it is different, how did that change your perception of yourself? Are they right or are you, when the"
554,Who Can Top Up My Accounts?,Considering this utterance: Who Can Top Up My Accounts? What is the intent that best describes it?,"It seems that I am in a very small minority that thinks this is an uttering. I would say that the majority would interpret this as Who can I get to Top up my accounts (I'm sure there is some variant of this but I can't remember it.)
In this case there seems to be no ambiguity as the question and the answer are very much clear, and even if they were not it would not seem like they could be easily misunderstood in that context.
My problem is, it seems like I'm not even the only person that believes this to actually be an ambiguous utterances or at least a poor question. So my real question is why? Why does this seem to have the potential to cause ambiguity or misunderstanding? Does it because of some other rules? For example, the last question that is very clear (in the context of an interview) is Who do you hire? - but it can easily be confused. Am I right? Am i being oversensitive? Or am I missing something? 
Note 1:
I am not asking for a list of all the possible variants of Who, I'd prefer to get opinions from people with experience in this kind of context, to try and understand the reasoning. My goal is not to come with a canonical answer, but to figure out if there are real cases in which there can be misunderstanding because it is ambiguous? If there's nothing then I'll accept that there just isn't much ambiguity. If it's just me I will keep asking questions until I understand or someone points me to an authoritative source and says that's it. But if it really turns out that this can cause much confusion I think it should be addressed. Note also I don't think this question should count as ambiguous, because my main reason for it being ambiguous is because that a lot of people (including me) think that it could also be who, that makes me think they have a similar intent.   This question would probably not be closed, only because I didn't ask a clarifying question about it and thus people would assume the reason that they are closed is due to a misunderstanding and would want to know the real reason, which is what I was trying to avoid by not posting it originally. (Also, please don, feel free to close this if you think so, this isn,t my question)
Update: I should probably rephrase my previous question as:"
555,Show Me How To Top Up With My Card,Considering this utterance: Show Me How To Top Up With My Card What is the intent that best describes it?,"Show me how to use the ATM. Showmehowtotopupwithmycard.com: a place from which to learn? And, if that’s the case, how do you think the site should be organized? In this post, I‘ll share my thoughts on how the best sites are organized, and why I think you should consider doing the same.

I”ve done this before when I created my personal website (http://www.mikeclarkweb.net/). But, as I mentioned, that was a much more elaborate project, with many, many components, so it was really a lot of fun to design and build. This website is different, though, because it is targeted towards someone who wants to top up and cash out with their debit card. And I was curious if someone wanted to make a site like this one already existed! After all, people are always trying to find out how their card works. So, it struck me that there should already exist a tool to help people figure this kind of thing out. I went online to search for this very question, but I only found very limited answers that were not exactly what I wanted or expected to read, or I couldn„t even get to work for some reason. That‚s why, this time, when writing this, my goal was to create a website which was organized in a way that would allow a user to quickly and easily get the answer to their question. Because, to be frank, most websites are very cluttered and hard to understand. They usually don“t use common sense to organize the content, which really makes them a pain for users. For more info, check out Why You Should Organize For Users on the Internet. As a matter of fact, organizing a page of content by what is being explained is actually the most effective method of making it easy for a new user of a piece of information to get it. Here, then, is my method to creating a clear and easy-to-understand site. First of all I had this idea: I need help. But I also realized, for my site to really work well, the help should actually come from a resource, like me, who has a unique and specific kind knowledge about these sorts of tools. If I don't actually have the resources, experience, etc... the user would"
556,I Topped Up My Card But The Money Disappeared.,Considering this utterance: I Topped Up My Card But The Money Disappeared. What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it something like this?

I:I Toppup My CC but The money that I used disappeared.
OR
""I T-O-P-U-p-M My C-C But...
(Note: the last ""m"" in this sentence is a ""double-t"" or ""D-T"" that is used in a colloquial or conversational way.  I hope you see that. :) )
The meaning would be the same. I'm using CC because the word ""card(s)"" is not used correctly in your original statement. The meaning of this is:
It means that the CC that was used to fund this transaction was taken away from that CC in some method of fraud. If you really want a card to be lost, the card would not be in that cardholder's possession because then this statement would mean they gave this card away. But that's just semantics. This is how I would say it. So let's do a few more. Try to figure out which ones sound the most like you're telling a truth!
If you had this to say, you'd have a different meaning: 
- It took too long to buy that item
So, this meaning has the opposite meaning you want. What you say: ""I toppu my cc"".
Meaning: It's taking longer than it should to complete the transaction you mentioned, and you are using a CC on the statement which shows you don't have/want that specific card anymore. You've moved the money to other CC and don;t plan to use the previous CC. (Or the new CC is just an example. It could be whatever.)
Here's my next one. ""You took my money!"" That doesn't really mean anything. In most cases it's probably an exaggeration, so I wouldn't use it, even if you wanted to. A few people might think it meant something in their specific scenario, but the odds of that are fairly low. Here's an idea: Try saying something else about the situation. Something like: This money has no more value to me than a piece of paper on which you could say ""Money doesn;'t it"". You can't tell me anything more about my situation from my CC statement than the fact that it was a transaction using my personal/private CC, then you took"
557,What Are The Limits To Using Disposable Virtual Cards?,Considering this utterance: What Are The Limits To Using Disposable Virtual Cards? What is the intent that best describes it?,"It is clear that I believe it is morally and technically irresponsible to use such virtual cards in many cases; and I will discuss why I have come to that conclusion, as well as a proposed solution in a later post. But here I must explain to you why it's not possible to completely remove the risk.
In the past, it was possible for the software to be so ""perfect"" that when a virus infected the hard drive a program would simply not work. Thus, I could still do important work, and the computer would be safe. This was the only protection that mattered at that time, when there were no backup systems. Now we have backups, so it becomes necessary to protect against them as effectively as we do against viruses. The problem is, if our backup system is also our main operating system, we still don't know where the backup is. We cannot control its access to critical software. If someone gets into the system by hacking into our primary backup program, that is just as bad as getting into it by virus infection, but we cannot know it and take preventative measures. I propose that in that case, the virus infecting the OS will automatically become the main program. It cannot be removed unless the entire computer is taken apart and examined. And of course, there is not enough time in the world. A new virus is always being created at great speed, with many more to come. To say nothing of the millions of viruses out there for all I know. They change every day. That is why backup software has to take the place of primary operating software in this matter, for now. So the ""risk of using"" is really the same as the danger of not using, only now it can be managed. For example, you can use virtual machine software, instead of your OS, which is a perfectly safe practice as long as only virtual machines are used. Virtual machines can have their own primary system and operating programs, just like physical machines have. In a virtual environment, viruses are not nearly as dangerous because they cannot do any damage to anything outside. You are in complete control. There is no risk of damaging your backups if your primary OS is infected. Even with a physical, ""real"" backup, your data is safe if you keep it all in one place. Since that cannot always be guaranteed either, a backup can become a danger to itself if it resides"
558,How Many Transactions Can I Do With One Disposable Card?,Considering this utterance: How Many Transactions Can I Do With One Disposable Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What does this statement tell us? This sentence gives us an estimate of the number of transactions (credit, debit or purchase) that we could perform with a single card. This is important in order to prevent fraud.
The best estimate is obtained by dividing the card's credit line by $5.00, and multiply that by 2 (for debit and charge transactions). This way you can estimate the approximate number in both cases."

What is the intent that best describes it?,"And is it the same intent of using a credit card that was given to you as yours? (I.e., I think that I am the rightful owner of this credit/bank account)

A:
B.
It is a combination of both and it is both the credit and the bank account.  If you think someone stole your credit, or if you thought it was being used improperly you could say I stole my credit. It is similar to using someone's bank accounts without permission to say someone is stealing my bank's money. When you say that someone has stolen your card, it can mean you lost it (or the person you are accusing stole it), or that you have a problem with someone using it, etc. If that is not the meaning you meant, then please clarify."
561,Someone Is Using My Account,Considering this utterance: Someone Is Using My Account What is the intent that best describes it?,"I know I have a certain account and that I own the company.

My Account is a noun. It is used as such: My account has been stolen, My company's account was hacked, etc."
562,Someone I Don'T Know Has Used My Card Without Permission.,Considering this utterance: Someone I Don'T Know Has Used My Card Without Permission. What is the intent that best describes it?,"1.
Someone I've never heard of used my card number at a place I was
at. (I think the implication might be that he/she used it to get
into the place and then went to other places where it was assumed
I'd given my permission, thus I could expect I would have been
charged for those)
2. Someone
tried to use my money for things that are not mine. But I am not
suspect, and have not asked the bank to block the card, therefore
it's likely that I did not authorize it in the first place. Also
if I had, I'd expect charges at the very least to be blocked in
time. Thus, this is unlikely to have happened. If my bank did
block, it's still unlikely. It's also unlikely that someone would
try to withdraw money on a card without my consent, even if they
had permission to draw on the account
3. A
friend has been using my cards on our joint account and I haven't
been able to find out who he is and where he's been buying
gifts. This I think is a little different than #2 in that
although I'm not likely to want a complete stranger stealing my
money, if it happens at least I can identify/locate my friend
(which is what I need) to fix the situation. On the other hand,
since the friend is not my acquaintance, maybe #1 fits a better
description. The reason I suspect #3 is because this friend has
always been a good friend and trustworthy. And yet there was no
communication from the person who used the cards, so it may be
that my guess about #4 was correct that the communication was a
fake attempt to lure me into not asking my brother. I don't know
what my best friend would be able or willing to do in order to
get the money back from this."
563,My Card Was Used Without My Permission.,Considering this utterance: My Card Was Used Without My Permission. What is the intent that best describes it?,"Intent – The state of mind with which a person acts.
In this context this means what is your intention? Is your primary aim to get a card? Or, do you intend to stop using the card and pay back all charges on it so you can enjoy the benefits of your card for the following period. If the latter, then my guess is that the primary motive or aim is to not to use the debit card any more. Therefore, if you did it, it is wrong, and if it does not get rectified then it must lead to legal consequences."
564,Can I Freeze My Card Right Now?,Considering this utterance: Can I Freeze My Card Right Now? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What does this question mean?

The answer to all this is simple:
What you are really asking is…”Is there a limit on how much my card can be frozen?“.
Now, it depends on what is meant by “freeze’ but generally, no, there is no limit for how many times you will be able to freeze (or unfreeze) a card. So, if you have a balance of $200, and a maximum balance that you can use on any single card of just $100, then yes, this will work. If you need to have $500 on only one card, but can have no more than $400 in any one account, you don‘t want to use your bank card like this because you may end up frozen out of all your accounts…if that is even possible. You are better off using your debit card so that even if the freeze doesn‚t work, the amount won‛t go down."

doubt, or a statement that makes it very likely that something else was done in the past that you did not know about
I think you're right on this, the use of doubt is a good example. 
It makes a transaction possible, and so the person who says it is not likely to lie about the transaction having happened, but that they were probably not the one who did it, since they doubt that it was them.
On the other hand, if a person does not use doubt, they are not really telling you about a doubt about your statement, as the word itself suggests,  they simply tell you that no one else has used your card, so there must be something to what you are saying."

He claims he was unaware my name was on my credit card, yet he never once asked me if it was ok to use my debit card and I never gave him the permission either. Since I have moved out of town I would still like to have my stuff back, but I need to figure out my best option.
I know the bank is not liable to help since he used it without me knowing. Does he have any recourse to get the things he bought for my family? If there is any law against taking someone else’s purchases without their permission I don”t know what it is. Would it be enough to say he has a restraining order? Is there anything else he can do to retrieve the items he took? Would I even be able to take the debit/credit card from the ATM? Please advise me on what I could possibly do. Please help!
The item is my daughters teddy bear. It is a special doll she gave herself for Christmas and a birthday. She loved it and has taken very good care of it since she was born because it looks almost exactly like her. The bear has been in the closet with her for the last 4 months because we have outgrown a bed. While she is out most of the time, I do take her and her sister to the mall and to school on occasion. Her sister can also use the card. So far we cannot get them back. They are all over the state of Florida. We have tried to call the stores and they either don't return calls or they say they don""t have the doll. This is all I can think is someone stole my daughter""s bear or sold it. Someone is using the same cards and debit on multiple occasions. Also, she has had the bear in her room since Christmas day, we just never went anywhere without her being with us.

Please Freeze It Asap What is the intent that best describes it?,"It’s a common and frustrating experience that most users will likely encounter while shopping online. You visit a retailer‘s website, search for and buy something, only to discover the next day that this item was shipped to you by the retailer instead of from an online third-party.
If you”re a victim of this scam, it would be a good idea to freeze all activity on the merchant“s account so they can‟t use your credit card to continue the fraud. This could result in additional fees, lost time, and other inconveniences. To avoid this, do the freezing yourself. Here„s how:
1. Log into your account at the site‚s login page. For example, if you use Amazon, go to www.amazon.com and log in. Or you can visit your favorite site directly. If there‛s no login button, try going through the same process as when you first made the purchase but this time using your card. Make sure you log into the account the page is for. The account that was used for the original transaction will be identified in the top right-hand corner of the window. Click on it. 2. After you are logged into this second account, click on “My Orders‡. 3. Under „Shipping Information‌, check the box next to ”Freeze this order.‬

Your bank may require you to do this by phone, so get your contact information ready. A merchant may not freeze an order until your payment clears. 8. Once the freeze is set up, you will get an e-mail from your ‪merchant indicating this information. 9. Go back to the Merchant s site and try to make a purchase to confirm the transaction. 10.

A:
This is a very old sentence, and it doesn't make a lot of sense. But I'll try to explain what I understand about it: the'someone else' is stealing money from the writer's account. And the sentence is an appeal to 'the bank' or to the legal system, where someone can prove that an account has been compromised (i.e stolen money). So perhaps a better way to put it may be:

I had my credit limit raised to $3xxx in November from $2000. When the balance came up for the January payment, they raised the limit on the card again to a $4000 limit. My husband and I are in the process of purchasing a home and we used the funds of about $20K of our credit line to buy a new house. We have been paying it in full for about 5 months now and have no late payments outstanding to any bank. There are 3 transactions in question that have occurred in December and January. The first one was on Dec 7, 2014 and the last one on Jan 6, 2015. I can't imagine how the bank could be able to raise our limit without us knowing about it at the time. In January 2015, my husband received a letter from the credit company which said that they were going to report the 3 fraudulent transactions to the police and place a negative mark on our report. They asked us to respond by Feb 15, and if we didn't respond, to inform the fraud department that I was the account holder. He called me to find out that the 2 other transactions were in Dec 2014.

It is meant for the purpose of expressing or conveying a message.
The message? ‘Don„t use your credit card at Wal-Mart. Their policy is not acceptable. Use your debit card instead. It“s cheaper, less risky. And the customer service at this store is awful. I had an issue with my debit yesterday. So I called it in and spoke with them. They sent me a credit check on the card and then told me my limit was reduced to only $40. Not cool and I will let them know. As a result, I now have to pay $80 plus interest for my purchase. But what do I do if I think my card was improperly used? I don‟‚t think it was because they are doing it to me. WalMart has a huge problem with their customer‣reputation. Everyone who shops at their store has the same impression. That they take advantage of people. ‚‹‍

Second, you need to know what you think. Did you get your card used fraudulently or have you been unfairly affected by someone? How do you feel about that? (For the purposes of this conversation, assume that Wal*Marts policy and their actions are just fine. You can't change the facts, but I can change your feelings to suit a different message.)

If your financial institution is not cooperating, you can go online and contact the customer service department. They should be able to assist you.

What would be the most common reasons why a person could be experiencing fraud online. It‘s important to remember that, no matter how hard you try, there will always be a way to get around the system. There could potentially be fraudsters that try to commit fraud in this manner, as it is a relatively cheap way of doing it. Another reason that they could do fraud is to scam people out of money. Some people are not as honest as they should. This is why they can potentially commit a fraudulent online transaction. The reason they do so is so they are able and willing to do it in the quickest time possible. So how do you stop fraud. In this situation you will need to contact your provider and ask them to cancel your credit card and have the card shut off. You cannot simply turn it on again, and the credit report will state this. Once this is done, your card will only be available to use online for a short period of time after this, then it will be locked again and no fraudulent transactions can happen again after that point. Also, if you are in any way concerned about credit cards, it may be in your best interest to look into a credit monitoring service. These types of service can help you to keep a watchful eye on all of your accounts so you don't have to worry about a scammer stealing from you at any given moment.

-1 for not providing a title. 
If my understanding is correct (and yes, I know I'm not a native speaker), this sentence has an implication that there's some form of theft involved. If the identity of a person has actually been lost or taken away, it could be said this way: ""if I get a notification of an unauthorized charge on my card, can I be sure that it's me that's been affected? (that is to say, if I check this notification, and see that an unknown person is using my credit card - in case that this is not the case, you can say I think it will look like I've been victimized.)"
574,I Think Someone Else Is Using My Card.  There Are Transactions I Didn'T Make.,Considering this utterance: I Think Someone Else Is Using My Card.  There Are Transactions I Didn'T Make. What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:
The verb ""think"" is a transitive verb. Think is an action that takes the object ""someone else"" and makes a claim about their actions and intentions. The verb in its trans-itive form is usually used to describe the act of thinking, rather than the idea of being aware or believing someone else thinks the same thing, or even having a hunch the person does think that way in most cases.
If you are unsure if they are thinking the thought, you would use ""Someone else is thinking.""

Can You Help Me Freeze It?,Considering this utterance: My Card Is Being Used Online To Make A Bunch Of Purchases! Someone Else Is Using It Fraudulently. Can You Help Me Freeze It? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Does that make a difference?

If you are an American living abroad, you might want to consider taking advantage of one of the programs that the U.S. Congress has made available to American citizens living overseas to freeze your credit. There are two programs and both are similar.
The first one I want you to be aware of is called the ""Overseas Priority Service"" program. If you have a United States Bank Account in the United Kingdom and you live overseas, it is possible for you get an account that allows you access to the frozen part of your U S. account even if you cannot physically be present in United Stated when transactions occur on your account. In order for this to happen, all you need to do is send an authorization form to your bank with your overseas account number and the number of months you would like access and to what dollar amount you want access. When this form is received by the bank, the money in their bank account is frozen until you provide access or provide additional documentation to authorize your request. You cannot request access from the account without a physical address in your local U.S territory. Once you receive access, there is an $15 service charge to activate the freezing and unfreezing of a credit report. It is important that this authorization process be completed before the month you wish to have your cards frozen. Your bank will provide a letter with the address of their branch that will receive the request for access so it can be sent to you. I have personally experienced the Overseas Banking Program. However, I was not the first person. So, before you freeze access you should contact the overseas bank to make sure it will accept the requests for the banking services you require and provide to them the information to properly request the freeze. The other banking program is a program called Creditor Account Freeze. Although there are several variations of it, this program allows the credit card holder access the the blocked portion of his or her credit file so that he or she can make an informed decision on whether it makes sense to cancel the cards. With it you can get a free copy of all the reports related to all your blocked cards so you may know what they say. This program will allow your personal credit record to look as if it was frozen for up to two years. For"

Please Prevent Them From Using It Immediately!,Considering this utterance: It Seems Someone Used My Card! There Are A Few Transactions From A Small Town In The Middle Of Nowhere That I Definitely Have Not Made! Please Prevent Them From Using It Immediately! What is the intent that best describes it?,"How do the words in this sentence relate to that?

""It Seems"" is an example sentence where you need to use the ""What"" and ""That"" parts of your question.
The key here is that there isn't a simple answer. We don't know what the speaker wants us to know, or what's going on in their life, so it's hard to get an idea of what kind of answer they're looking for. 
Here we have to ask a more general question:
In what way? (This is like the first half of the sentence above.)
What do you want me to prevent them from doing? Or, how would you say this in English? What do those words mean in the context?"

582,My Card Has Been Compromised,Considering this utterance: My Card Has Been Compromised What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it meant that the card has been compromised? If so, what does the speaker/writer expect a person to take away from the uttering of the sentence.
If it is meant to suggest that a security measure has happened, would the person be taken aback and shocked? Is the suggestion of compromise not a serious issue that should be addressed? 
The intent of this phrase, from an English perspective, is what should I do?. The utter of such phrase is very different to that of ""I'm being hacked""
""I have been hacked."" (Hackers are getting information from a computer that they did not want to see.)
This is a phrase that suggests that what happened has already happened and that it happened to you. This phrase implies the idea of being under threat, which is why it makes more sense to me here than here. There is some sense as to what you can do to protect yourself if this happens to yourself."
583,What Should I Do If I Think That Someone Else May Be Using My Card.,Considering this utterance: What Should I Do If I Think That Someone Else May Be Using My Card. What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is he thinking about the act of using it while he is not thinking of it or is he actually already thinking that someone else may be using the card? If the latter, then it means he already suspects that it may happen, and has planned it. If it is an act, he might think that he may have lost it, or something like that.
The first thing that comes to mind is that of a 'warning shot' for something he suspects will happen. In this case, the warning should be clear enough in the sense that you should stop doing your current actions (use the credit card) because someone might be doing that in your name, so you can avoid any further negative consequence. However, you will not tell them to stop, but rather warn them. So that might work in this example in that case. 
Another way to view it would be that the first sentence is just a rhetorical question in which the speaker does not want to take a risk and asks someone who is more familiar and is also aware of the potential consequence in case something happens. But the person who replies to it does it in a way they are not willing to be involved in any negative consequences that may follow. The speaker can either get what they want without doing anything, which he would not take it if he had known that there was a potential issue. Or he could avoid it all and not do it at all. He will take the second option."

The best description is: You must freeze all of your transactions with our bank for 30 days in order to freeze your credit cards so that they cannot be used.
For this reason we are unable to process your payment. You can still log into your account with your user ID and password to check your other bank accounts. However we highly advise that you freeze them as well. (...)
If you do not, then in 30 to 50 days your creditors may start reporting that the cards were used at your address. They will also contact the credit bureaus to report the charges. We know all this because we have a contract with the 3 credit reporting bures that gives us the info on your activity. If your burer sees a transaction, and reports it and the charge, the bural may report that it was not your card that was used, but that there were charges at the location that matched the card number you used and it must have been used by someone else. And in some cases, it will be reported that credit was issued or that a new account was opened, which will have negative consequences in your report. Also, you will not be able to make a payment to us as long as your accounts are frozen. For that reason, we recommend you to take immediate action and freeze the accounts and credit card. Once the freeze is on, there will only be one report available on any creditor's database. To freeze it, do the following. On line: www.creditreport.com click on freeze then on our acoount number: XXX-XXX-XXXX. That will give you a code to put into the website. Then click OK. In case you have to call the company, your bank has a 24hr line, 800-564-7669. After 30 day your cards will stay frozen, unless you unfrize them. Please remember that once frozen your acount cannot have funds taken without the permission from your attorney. The freezing process is free. Just make your arrangements and let us know to do it in the next 30days. This is a very important step. Our account must be frozen for the entire month. Otherwise the creditor will freeze our account and we will lose the money. So, please freeze at least the day after you get the email. Even then it is not a guarantee that your balance wont be stolen. It is more like a"

And, can someone be so ""determined"" as to get past the ""I'm trying to buy something"" question? Is there a more clever way to think about this? 
Thanks,

UPDATE
This question is not about the actual freezing of my debit or credit cards (I've done that before to prevent theft). This question, to me, is more about, ""How do I know someone else is doing these transactions?""
In response to @John, I understand that, in the case of ""banking fraud,"" the person making the transaction is really banking on the fact that the bank will do the work to investigate, rather than the consumer making an affirmative effort to stop it (which may or may not include calling the number for customer service.  But that's for another question.)  For the purpose at hand, however, my question was, and remains, about how the average person should go about freezing their credit or debit card online to try to thwart fraud.
(My question would be the same even if this was done in person at a grocery store or bank. The idea is that a fraud person would get access and take over my account, without my knowledge. How would I prevent that? What would that be called? The fact of me being aware of this doesn't answer that.)
So, with that in mind, let me ask this question again, but with the understanding that it is for a credit/debit card:
How, as the customer, should I go to freezing my Credit/Debit Card online? As in, do it in a way that will make it difficult for the fraudster to reverse? That is, the credit-card-fraud guy is going to know about my freeze and will, no doubt, be very persistent, if for no other reason than that he"

In essence, he is saying that someone may have gotten his credit card details and used them to make transactions that he doesn't recognize. 
A simple statement of ""someone got my creditcard details, and made a bunch of purchases"" isn’t likely to raise a red flag. It doesn‚Äôt indicate if the purchases were malicious or if there was a legitimate reason why you are being billed for them. But if you get the sense there may be some malicious intent, this type of statement can give you a heads up."
589,Someone Else Used My Card!,Considering this utterance: Someone Else Used My Card! What is the intent that best describes it?,"This is a difficult question with no easy answer. The intent is probably something like:
The person stole (their card) and used it without me. (or them).
I wish the person who stole their card (means) the same thing that the thief (the other person) did not me use it.
Someone is in a worse position than me (that's me) because they lost (someone elses stuff). The thief is stealing from me, which is worse. 
That was my thoughts. I'd appreciate hearing what the community thinks. :)

Thanks!  -   J.T.S
[UPDATE]: @Rory - I'm sorry, it was meant to come off as a question rather than be an answer, but I thought it might help. This one is different I would think, because it's not about a person's card. It's about the card itself. So maybe a better question is, ""Would the context make someone think about this differently?""
For example, if your card was stolen and then used at a store, would you consider it a different situation then this? Because here it would more likely be interpreted as someone losing something, rather then someone stealing someone els's things. However, in your example someone is using the stolen card, and is therefore stealing another person el's thing. That is why I asked, what is your take on the original statement. Thank you!

590,I Believe Someone Is Using My Card Without My Agreement!,Considering this utterance: I Believe Someone Is Using My Card Without My Agreement! What is the intent that best describes it?,"If you don’t know the answer to this question, it can help you to get a better grasp of your customer‘s attitude. You can determine if their intent to buy is “positive”.
– ‘positive intent“:
A positive intention implies that your prospect is happy to hear what you‖re saying (and you want him/her to be happy, too), and will do anything to achieve your goals (even if it„s not your own).
You can think of it as a win-win situation. For example: If you have an advertisement of a local restaurant on your homepage and your visitor clicks on it, you will both win (customer for the meal and you for getting a customer)
In a similar way, if a prospect reads one of our emails, he/she can read it more than once and if the subject of his mail is interesting for him, the chance is high he would share it with someone else. And this is exactly what we want to happen. Therefore we should be interested in what prospects are about and what they have to show. A „negative‟ intent means that, for whatever reason, your prospects don't want you and they will never buy from you. In that situation, we would rather keep our distance. We do not want our customers to ‚lose‛. If your email was ‛liked‚ by your client, but the intention was negative, don´t let him see the email again. The same can be said for social media. Social media is a great tool to build your brand. But if you only look at the ‪positive side‬ of social marketing, then you might fail to grow in the long-term. Your customers are there for a reason (at least they think so). They are trying to fulfill their needs or solve their pain (in the case of inbound marketing). It‰s your job to help them with that. This way they won't be ‰losing‸ a lot of time and money with you (or with your company) in return. Don't forget that a client can also be a competitor, so try to win them not only by providing a good service, as we have mentioned before, and also by winning their trust. They must feel safe that you keep your promises"
591,"If I Feel Someone Has My Card Information, Can I Get A New Card?","Considering this utterance: If I Feel Someone Has My Card Information, Can I Get A New Card? What is the intent that best describes it?","What is it trying to communicate? What does it mean? Is it just a statement of fact? Can this be a cause for suspicion? This seems to me to be something people should consider before they give any answer. It is easy to fall into an “oh, that’s just how we do it” type of answer without thinking about what it means or where it leaves us in the legal process…
A more complete answer that is more likely to give a good reason for this ‘practice‘ and give you a better understanding of your legal rights would include a little more discussion of how to find a way to protect yourself, as the card companies are very good at getting people to believe you have no recourse (because you don‟t…).
I‚eld that ‚if ‬you feel someone has your card information, you should make an effort to get a new card as quickly as possible‥
It is very important not to let them use the same numbers for the next card.
If you know someone who is in this situation, be aware of this. Ask them if they are getting new numbers. If not, ask questions to make sure no other people have your old credit card numbers and why they don't. They may be thinking it is too inconvenient to ask for a different card number, so they just don'l want to say anything at all. Don't let the people get away with just telling you to do nothing or just being vague with you. 
The last question to add is to see if the bank has any kind of policy about this so that we can make a policy as to what to lookfor. I do have another question. My understanding is that the numbers on a creditcard have to go into a computer for processing and then there is some kindof a record kept of what is going on. So, how is this kept? Are these numbers recorded at one place and that place notifies another? I guess that makes them a single key that they can use for everything. But how do you prove that it was them when they use it for something else? And if that person has no idea that you are using your credit cards, then that gives you your only chance of proving that this is an illegal act because you were denied your rights under that credit agreement...

b) Frightened but curious
c) Curious but ready to be angry
d) Angry that I wasn't notified sooner
I think the answer is a, right? The second option doesn't seem to make sense, unless the person was scared about something (which might be reasonable if they had been hacked and their credit card was being used). The last two options, while not exactly incorrect, still seem far-fetched, as the question would be more reasonable phrased as ""I have been given some reason to suspect that an unknown party has access to my credit cards, what do I do about it?"".
If there was an answer like ""It's been reported to the authorities and you have no proof that there is anything wrong"" which doesn;t answer the actual question but still addresses the stated issue, does it deserve an up-vote? (The answer seems like it should)
EDIT: My understanding of this question was ""what do people do when their bank statements are being stolen, but it's not known who is responsible"", which is an odd statement and would make me ask for clarification (and would also make it very hard to provide an example of a real scenario). 
For example, one could answer ""Well, you should report it to your bank"" - which would not be incorrect (even if it did nothing about the bank being hacked), but would likely be incomplete.  The question could also be asked as if one has been the victim of online fraud (but not by hacking).
In the case of the OP, I think I would have answered ""Call your credit company and ask them to cancel your card"". But, again, there would usually be a bit of clarification or at least some explanation of why the situation is unusual. It's just odd to me that the most upvoted answer to a question on this site isn't the one that directly answers the problem.

594,I Think My Child Used My Card While I Wasn'T Home.,Considering this utterance: I Think My Child Used My Card While I Wasn'T Home. What is the intent that best describes it?,"What can I reasonably expect to happen with that intent when the card is used?

Intent and Expectations:
The first step will be a question on intent. This is usually the first place to begin the process.
""What was the thought behind the utterances?"" A very broad question but very important. ""What is your expectation on the use of the money?"" This will have a lot of impact, so be prepared. What type of expectation did you have with you? ""Was it a personal expectation?"" ""Did you know your spouse would be using it?"" If you don't have an expectation you need to do a bit more thinking about. In general I think that most people know what they think about others but don’t have enough experience to actually talk to them about their thoughts. It's a great example of a ""hidden question,"" that you are not aware of, that will help you understand their expectations. If they are expecting you to come back and you did not then they will think you knew or something of that nature, and will likely expect that they can just tell you what it was. The expectation for the family is often different. A person may have the expectation that the child should tell the truth. But what is their expectation about me and how I react to a revelation? An expectation may be that we may not want to know. How does my spouse think a conversation between mother and child will go? Expectant parents tend to think ""if I tell them they won't find out anyway.""
An important point to consider is how a disclosure will affect you. People are often in a position where they have expectations about what someone will do and they may or may nor know if their spouse will respond in that way to an assertion of something. You need your own internal process to be able to understand the expectations of others as well as the other side of their process, their assumptions. I tend not to have much expectation of what others are thinking until I have been in the situation and had time to get my own expectations down. Expectation is really just assumptions that become expectations based on some experience. Your own experience is as much a part of this answer as theirs. For example, a wife may assume that if her husband knows he'll be upset about it, or that he is so hurt he will not be interested in talking to her about a thing."

What are some ways I could prove that this is not me? Would it mean if you use it on a website (online transactions only) and they are listed as the buyer?  And what if someone used my cards to go to a store and used the register number on the transaction and then made the sale in cash? They have the store's card machine number and my ID number. What if it was stolen from a cashier or they put some numbers in their computer and the cash was credited to someone. Would that not be my information? I am a little confused. Can someone who knows more about this please help me understand? [This is a bit different. This could mean that they used someone's ID and not their own. For example:

An answer on this site is ""a question-answer pair on the subject as framed in the question."" Since the OP didn't specify, it was difficult to guess what he or she meant, so I assumed the ""do-all"" interpretation. It's one of those things that the average person could figure out if they knew the basics of grammar and had a decent English class in high school, but it's hard to find a good explanation for an average reader on a forum like this.
I've always thought that ""atm"" was a term of art, which means that it is jargon, not English (or even American).
So, what is this term jargon? It is a technical term, and jargon in general is something like ""technical speech"". I think that technical speech can be useful if you're talking about something that's well known (like nuclear fission), but if the topic is new, jargon will often be more useful than plain words. In that case the only choice you have is to ask for help and use some of these jargon terms in your writing:
""I am not sure, if we should use the term ""all atms"", or just the one that we know.""
(Note: You can't assume the jargon is used by the author, because there's probably another explanation available.)
If the technical jargon wasn't clear, I'd say that is was clear that you had some questions about technical terms. If you want to avoid being misunderstood, make some effort to use jargon that people are already using, or at least use it when you can see that someone is familiar with the terms that describe your subject. For example: ""We have a problem in our application."" That is much easier for someone to accept than ""I think we have an issue where...""
You may want something less complicated for your own writing, such as ""My understanding of all atm is..."", etc. (Note that I also don't think ""understandings"" is correct.)"
601,Which Atms Accept This Card?,Considering this utterance: Which Atms Accept This Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it to get an Atm to accept an ATM card? Which intent was best, that is, would the best result be that an atm accepts a card, or that it's the right thing to do? That one can not tell, and is only by observation of outcomes in fact known."
602,Where Is The Closest Mastercard Atm?,Considering this utterance: Where Is The Closest Mastercard Atm? What is the intent that best describes it?,"To ask, ""where is a MasterCard ATM"" is an inquiry which will probably result in you receiving the answer, """"The closest ATM is in the Walgreen's."". For you to be able to understand this, you need to first know what an ATM (Automatic Teller Machine) is, and what it is used for. In fact, the name ""atm"" means bank and the machine is essentially a device that connects to a bank account through a telephone line and allows you, through the use of an electronic device, to access your funds. To be a bit more specific, an Automated Telling Machine (ATM)is basically a piece of electronics which is designed to allow a customer to make a transfer of funds from a checking or savings account to another account held at a financial institution. These ATMs allow users to transfer cash from one account into another or to obtain cash by making a withdrawal from an account at any bank or credit union.

What Is An ATM?
An ATM, more commonly referred to as an automated teller machine, (or cash machine) or cash card machine, is basically an automatic tellering machine which allows a person to withdraw cash using a magnetic stripe or chip card from their bankaccounts. When you withdraw the cash, it will be loaded into your account by the bank through your credit card. Once you receive the information regarding the amount of money available in your cash account, your machine will then print the receipt which identifies what your withdrawal was. It will also give you the option of taking your receipt with you when you wish to deposit more funds into the account. An ATM is just a machine that takes money away from your accounts, deposits it into others. The reason the banks do this is to help keep your personal information secure. Since there is no middleman involved in this process, as in a standard bank deposit, no one would know your private personal identification which includes your bank routing numbers, account numbers and so forth; this would also allow you and any other person you would deposit funds to easily transfer the money from account with the card, without needing to give anyone personal details. Because of this security feature, banks have been known to offer the best rates in money transfer to other banks. But what if you want some cash? Well, when someone wants to take out cash (through withdrawing the funds), their own funds will first"

This would fall into the category of desire.

605,How Do I Know Which Atms Will Accept This Card?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Know Which Atms Will Accept This Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I am not certain.
This sentence means something is unclear, but what? Does it mean that what you say in this sentence is an unclear thing or it just means the author is not sure what it is? Maybe the speaker is just making an expression of surprise at the fact this is a question he is asking. That he has no clear idea of the answer. 
It could also mean: This is something to question, like a fact, and you should not just believe it blindly. This also means that this could be something about a real-world question where you might want to find out from people who know that area of science. It just says it in an abstract way. Like the word ""card"" in the title is referring to some sort of a scientific instrument or concept. The author just wanted to mention that maybe you need to research it. Maybe this was something like an experiment done on the person speaking, or something else. Or, it could mean the question is about the way you speak and the people you are interacting with, that there could exist some kind of atmos that accept/does not accept your card, so it does not mean much, because you have to interact with it all the time."

B - The intent of this sentence is to ask ""Is there any ATM nearby?""
C - This sentence implies that an ATM is nearby. The speaker intends to tell someone about this. It is likely to be used to say that ""I will go to the bank to take out some money.""
D - An ATM may be located close by here. However, it is still an open question whether it exists. I believe this question could also be asked in an informal situation as a conversation starter."

I'm not entirely sure that I understand this question correctly. Is this just a question of how to read the meaning of a sentence, or something else? For example, there are a couple of sentences that could be expressed like the one you mentioned, where the intended message is ""what I am asking is: where are the locations of atoms that can accept this card?"" But this would be a fairly confusing way to write them, since that doesn't actually seem to be the message being conveyed in the sentence. I would guess that's the sort of thing that would need to have been put into some sort language, to make the intention of it clear? It's not clear in my mind, but I might as well ask.

The sentence can be rewritten to use two more simple paraphs: ""Where are some of my atoms?"" and ""What locations do atoms have, that accept these cards?"".
This may be somewhat difficult to understand (I have not yet had access to a dictionary), but the question is really asking about the difference between the ""some"" and the word ""locations"", since the two paraphrises are really different. Also, the other one is much shorter. If you wanted to get to the idea, this is how you would do it, which should give you the hint of where to go from there. It may seem obvious, if not in that form, at least as a word-for-word translation. This sentence has many paraphases, though they may not all work well in general for other authors.

609,Which Atms Accept This Placard ?,Considering this utterance: Which Atms Accept This Placard ? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Considering this utterance: Which Atms Accept This Placard?. What is the intent that best describes it?.

It is an action sentence which states what someone did. Here, the ‘did’ clause is followed by an “atm” and an object. There is a verb ” accept“. It can be a noun phrase, a relative clause, or an adverb phrase. The subject of the verb is ’atms‘, which is in ‚general usage‚ meaning „human beings.„ This is probably what is meant by the author of this card, by saying that †at the time that the card was issued all atms were human‡. However, if he has a specific group of atm in mind (like ′all atmos‖, ″a specific type of‵) then the word ‗at‴ in the phrase ‖all‪ ‫atmos ‪ who accept this‬‗ could be replaced with this specific word to indicate the kind of beings to which this is referring.

610,Help Me Locate The Nearest Atm.,Considering this utterance: Help Me Locate The Nearest Atm. What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is the speaker trying to convey the message that they want their phone number and location of the nearest atm?
In this context, it can be used in different ways: 1) To ask somebody for their number & location 2) For a business that provides ATM services 3) In a chat application, in order for users to help each other in finding the closest ATM
The second and third cases (businesses and apps) are most likely to be able to provide an atmsense for this meaning of ""Help Me"".

A:
You don't know the language.  You can't just go to the dictionary and take the word's definition word-for-word. I can tell you that at the very least, the first word that pops into your head as the translation might not be the proper one.
I can also tell that when you try to define the sentence, you are actually trying too hard, and thus doing a disservice to yourself. The only thing about your question that is ""correct"" about it is that it's grammatically wrong. But it doesn't necessarily mean anything, other than that you need to work on your vocabulary, so you don;t sound like a native speaker. As for the actual content and your translation, that seems fine to me, but I am not native English speaker, either."
611,What Atms Is The Card Okay To Use At?,Considering this utterance: What Atms Is The Card Okay To Use At? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This is a question many of us face. We can all relate to this, when we are trying to figure out what to do with a certain card that is in our hands. There may be other cards that are in hand that we do not need to use.
In this example, the card is not a card in play from another player. It comes from ourselves. Our deck has one card with this exact name, face up. So, what do we make of this? The best answer is to make this a decision based on how you feel. Do you really want to have this card? This question is often a bit complicated. The more cards you have of an intent the better your chances are of knowing what you should. If you don’t have it, don't do it. No exceptions! This is where knowing you want what is on your mind can save you. You can use a thought to help you decide whether or not you will play this or any other card. When you know how to think you can do almost anything. This may seem like it is out of your control or it‘s a very simple thing. But, it's not. With practice, we can learn to control what we think by thinking. And, this is how a whole host of things come to pass. Now, you may ask, ""So what should I do about this?"". There's really only one answer. Use the Atm and the rest of the deck accordingly. In the case of Atts, they are a key card used to decide on play. Many of them make a great deal of sense when used this way. They help guide you in a direction. However, that may not be the direction you desire. For this reason, there are other ways to look at AtMs and make them work for you without giving away your intentions. Let‍s go through an example of how this can be done. As we start to deal, let's say we see another AtmA. Since we want our AtM to be able to give us a strong answer, why wouldn't a good choice be this one in particular:
""As a result of me dealing, I have a hand of 9 atms and one of 3 atts.""
The card we're about to play in front of another card may have the following AtT. (Let's go with"

614,How Can I Withdraw Money?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Withdraw Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The intent of the question, if you were to analyze and understand it, is to gain information regarding how to withdraw money from your account, and the most logical and simplest route to achieve such an end is by writing a bank letter.
There is nothing in the way of your question to indicate that you want to open a new account for withdrawing money, thus, this is also a good assumption. You can find out how and where to send or submit a letter, to be successful, by searching for it online or by asking your bank in person. In the case of my bank, there is a specific address with a mailbox. It is called the “withdrawal address” and is usually printed right after the words ‘withdrawn’ or ”with-draw“. The bank requires a written request to receive the money in question and this will be a separate letter and not in any way related to the account you have opened. A bank will usually be happy to mail a withdrawal letter to you, as it is very common to have a lot of requests for them to do so, especially in times, like now, when people are in need of money. As long as the letter is properly written and signed by you and a copy of proof of address. This means a photo of a current proof-of-address, a valid and current photo identification document such as a passport or government issued driver‘s license, which will indicate the address printed on said proof. If these things aren‚Äôt possible with your current situation, you can always request a paper copy as well. Your bank is bound to give you this information and they don‡Æt usually require a deposit or fee from a person requesting the said withdrawal, but it may depend on the current amount to move, your relationship with the bank and other factors that are beyond your control. There are other ways, although not as common. Some banks have other addresses, that will have mailboxes that the banks will send the withdrawal request for, such addresses are usually in a different country and will require you to go to that country in order to collect the funds. I can„t help but to laugh at the fact that most banks in today‰Ås world are located in countries where they get less than 0.5 cents in tax from each bank account. They even charge a fee"
615,How Many Miles Away Is The Atm?,Considering this utterance: How Many Miles Away Is The Atm? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What kind of meaning can be inferred? How many possible answers to this question could there be, and which of those best describe the meaning?

I'm currently studying the theory of interpretation and have come across the following sentence in the book I'm reading:
""The fact that we can understand language does not mean that our language is meaningful"".
What's interesting is that in this case, it appears the speaker/author has a fixed opinion on this, without further elaboration of his/her stance. He/She states that he/she is ""not saying that"". So does this mean there is another way to interpret the sentence without this pre-judgment, that it is possible that this is a meaningless language? If so, does his stance mean this language has no meaning, or is this a matter of semantics that doesn't necessarily imply the lack of a meaning.
If this statement is not true, then what implications can we draw from it, given that some people are not happy with it. For example, the statement seems to be the author's reason for rejecting natural language (i.e., language used by humans) as a valid way for communicating meaning and for using it for other matters as well like science. But how do we know for certain that language can't be used in other ways, apart from this specific situation? The author seems so confident in his statement, but how is it possible to prove it without having first-hand knowledge of how a language functions and if it doesn’t mean something different (maybe something like the opposite).
Also, if anyone can link up other resources that are related to what I've just asked, I would appreciate it a lot. It's a very interesting question. 
Thank you very much. Your help will be greatly appreciated. Please don't hesitate to ask me to clarify certain aspects. I hope there's someone out there who can help me!

616,From Where Can I Withdraw?,Considering this utterance: From Where Can I Withdraw? What is the intent that best describes it?,"To withdraw is to remove oneself from a location.
Or
The intent of the speaker is so to withdraw oneself
Is there any difference between the two interpretations? 
If so, why are they being used in the same manner? If not, I wonder why we use to? to to with the present perfect? What are the rules for using these two forms? Also, if the first meaning is true, then what is its use in this example? The meaning here is not to ""remove oneself"". The speaker does not say ""I am now going to... "" but ""Where can I go?"". Is that correct? Why? I have been struggling with this for some time but I do not understand.   Many thanks in advance. I am truly thankful for all the answers. It was very helpful. :)
P.S- I know the sentence above looks like a question. Sorry. That was not the original question but the answer helped me understand the question so now I would like to ask it again. Thanks. Also please try to answer as simply as possible. In a nutshell. If that is too difficult, that too will make sense. Thank you. The answers are very much appreciated. Many Thanks!
EDIT-  I hope to have a better question now but this is my last try. Please try and understand from where I started. My question is about the verb to:
Why do we normally use the form of to do in ""the present simple""?  Or, what happens in that form that we cannot do using the regular past simple form? That is, in what case do the forms look different? Does the past tense have to be added and if not which tense is used with which form and why? Is the to form not used when someone is saying ""you can... or can you not?""
This is a good illustration (from a book) of what to does:  We can do so and so... (or) We cannot. (To) Do is done. We do, we have done something. And then there is: To to something with a different meaning. This one is from the dictionary: I can go to a store (I can visit a place). This is why I use a dictionary a lot when I write an English essay. So I cannot understand why there are so many differences in these forms. A simple example would help a great deal"

It can be considered a request, a declaration, or an offer.
When I see this phrase, I can infer two things: 
If it is a declarative sentence, it expresses what you think about yourself, that is: ""This AT & T card will not accept the card of my Visa card"".   The use of will is important here, since you do not want to sound too confident about this.  It would be better to use could or possibly would and put this idea in a hypothetical situation. The following example could work well:

 ""AT &T does not support the use my card to charge purchases""
""AT&T cards only support Visa, Mastercard and Eurocard"""

And the best way to determine the meaning of a sentence is to consider the whole meaning. And if you don't have the full idea of the situation in mind, and you try to analyze it by looking at the word alone without considering the rest of it. In that process, you are going to fall into the trap of trying to find the answer in the wrong context. 
For this one, I will need to think about the complete meaning and the overall context before I give my interpretation. The best answer to a ""what does this sentence mean"" type question is going beyond the literal meaning to see how it fits in. Here I am not sure if it is literal, idiomatic, colloquial, slang or formal. But I still need some context to give the right answer. This sentence alone is not enough to tell what the author means."

623,Are There Any Atm Machines Near Me?,Considering this utterance: Are There Any Atm Machines Near Me? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Intent is when a speaker means something they are saying. When we try to figure out intent, we ask ourselves questions about what is being said and what else is involved in the conversation. It’s also possible to use context clues to help figure it out. This can be tricky, but the more experience you have with the language, the easier it will be to recognize the context.
The more difficult part is determining whether a sentence is a question or statement. There are several strategies to do this, and this post will provide some examples to show you the various ways you can look at the sentence, what the possible answers are, how we can use this to improve our writing and speaking skills. We‘ll also learn some other interesting points to note.


This is an example of a simple question:
Are there any atm machines near me? What does the speaker intend here? Well, she s asking about the current situation, so that s a possible answer in” that„s""‖what‚s being asked for. She is asking to find out whether or not she is in a place that has an ATM, because she knows that if“‬the answer""is"" there isn‰t‱an otherwhere, then she would have to go somewhere else‥….›‹. 
If you were‏to use these three lines to write a paragraph about it then the sentences would follow that order and read something like this: 

   Are  there  any  atms  near  me ?  What  is  the  current  situation

625,What Type Of Atms Accept This Card?,Considering this utterance: What Type Of Atms Accept This Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"It seems to me that there is a strong element of desire. So is that the case when we say such things? Or is there something deeper going on behind it all?

I was taught by the elders of my people to say this, but in a different way. They taught me in the manner that they taught others as well. I was very young, and they were much older than I. It was a time in my life when I still believed in what I heard and was learning how to live by my culture's rules.
The way we had been taught was that in order to speak we must first say, “God willing.” The first statement you speak must be an invocation to God for guidance in making the second. After one has spoken to his/her heart’s desire, then he/she may make the statement of belief. The elders taught us that we do not speak the way of our culture, we speak in this manner because we believe in our heart that God desires what we desire through the word of His mouth. Thus, they said, our words are not ours alone. We speak through God. This is not something that I believe, even at this time, in speaking about my belief in such a case, not as the elder's did it, as if their words were the words of God to the people. However, I cannot help but notice how differently they spoke, than we, who we are, do. If this is what they had taught the rest of the children of their peoples, it would help in explaining to them a way to make that difference in their speech. In doing so, perhaps there would be little contention with one another and one would not think of them as ‘not of this world‘ any longer. There would come a day when they would realize that this was the difference they saw within the ’other“ than what is in them. To speak of such matters would bring great shame upon us if it is truly the Lord‟s Word. As a result of that teaching, the majority of us believe this way, except for a few. Perhaps there are others that have yet to believe that such is God‹s Will. But, if you do, my friend, please believe my word that you have a friend in me. Please come to a meeting of mine.

626,Where Can I Use This Card At An Atm?,Considering this utterance: Where Can I Use This Card At An Atm? What is the intent that best describes it?,"a. To ask for an account of something. b. The question is about the meaning of the sentence in general. c. This is a way of testing the quality of a person you are dealing with. d. It is asking about a particular usage of this card. e. You’re asking the question because you want to be sure that the statement is true.
1. A. a. Where can I use this? (where to find the card, what you can do with it)
b. I didn”t know what that thing was called, where can i use that? or i didn t have any idea where i could use a card like that. i have no idea what it is. it seems very odd to me. but i did find a few places that it might be useful. (you found out that this is really a good idea, not a joke, or an unusual card you don‘t have) I would never have thought about it that way before. you didn't know you could do that, you must have been curious about that card!
2. C. this question tests whether the other person is telling the truth. if he says that he didn""t do anything, that you know of, then it“s a lie. he would have to explain what he did (but he wouldn""T want that) or confess to his past.

3. B. where do i find this at an ATM? i had never heard of it. and it sounds a bit like a prank. what if i said this to someone? would it sound a little strange? if I ask this about someone who doesn‟t tell the whole tale (i.e. someone with a secret) then maybe I should just say the first half only.

Find out if a card that has a name with an exclamation mark on it really exists or is this just a silly thing? In a word, yes. This is not a real card. There are just as many cards in the real deck as there are in this deck, but there is no special card and no one is telling you this has anything to do with anything in your real life. They just made you say these words. No one asked you if your intent was to say something that made sense. Your job is just to figure it out. In order to make this work I'm going give you the name of the person who invented the game. The name you can say and its meaning in one sentence. It will be easier to understand and the point of these things is for you to discover if the meaning you meant is similar or different from the actual meaning. For you see I just said that a person invented these cards, not they are invented. All these decks are really good and really fun. We are not inventing any new thing and we are telling the cards to tell us what they want you and me to know. So lets look. First is:
1. Which? Atm, which atm. Well you probably meant ATM. Its the abbreviation for Automatic Teller Machine and there can only be one. Why? I can not remember that. That one card does not mean anything and you will figure that out as you play the next card which

down vote
on another answer. I think I know why.
I think Toby answered the OP question about the meaning of 'withdraw' correctly: he intended to question whether withdrawing money was possible from AtMs and the answer was 'no, not really, you'd have to use something like a debit card, and have physical access.'
Now, the OPs question seems to have become about something else: how the ATM works. But that wasn't what the original question was. The OP's question, I believe, is about what you have the ability to do within the context of an ""AtM"". That is, 'Is there a way I could withdraw all of my money (from an ATm) in a bank?' I don't think the poster is asking 'can I use an atm to take money out of a cash machine, as opposed to the other way around?' (as you suggest.)
What I'm saying, Toby, isn't that you don'should vote down, per se. (I'm not saying that the down votes are justified, either). But I am asking you to consider the situation: is this question really about ATM withdrawal (in the first place?)? The poster asks whether he has the right to 'Withdraw (money) from (an) Atm.' I would like to hear the reasoning for the votes that have occurred so far, though, because at this time there has been no explanation of why they think they are correct. And I do think it is necessary to discuss your own voting on the main post, at least in the comments section. Please consider it. Thanks. :)

2) He is simply stating that where does a customer have to withdraw their money? At the bank is an answer that is most likely correct, but not correct enough for the speaker. The speaker is not simply asking a bank representative how to get money out of the banks’ offices. They are asking an entire organization, or a group of individuals what they can do when they want to do something to take their deposits with them. 
3) The answer to this question is quite complicated. This is because one must understand three things in order to answer:   1. When a depositor wants to “withdraw” money from a commercial bank, they are withdrawing paper notes, not their funds themselves. There is no such thing as a ‘depositor‘ in the modern banking world. 2. A commercial Bank does not actually take money as ’deposit“. As I mentioned in question 1, the Bank takes a promise to pay for some future period of time. It gives you paper I.O.U.s, which you can ”withdrawl„ from your bank. 3. Finally, money in banks is only a representation of funds that are in other places, and is nothing more than a medium of exchange for goods and services. You can‟t take your money and move it to another state, because it is actually the paper that represents the funds in another location, that you would move."

It is an indirect question where the speaker is trying to infer what the person does, and whether it is safe for them to use.
For example, the following may be what a speaker would say:
""I am very curious to know if you will use your card. Is it your ATM card? Because I don't want to worry.""
The speaker may not intend to directly ask this question. Yet, their tone indicates this to be a legitimate question which the target (the person being spoken to) is expected to answer. However, this is only an example - there are many other indirect questions like this. The following are indirect and may also indicate the situation of the question is not a simple as it appears: 
'This may or may never be used in a sentence: ""I would like to make sure it works.""  (If a statement, it could be ""You can use it at the ATM.""). The speaker might also ask ""Is it safe?"" and not know what to do with the answer, like ""It's safe."" (I don,t know).
So, how does this type of question go?  ""Can you?"" ""Will you? "" ""May you"" ""may be""?
How do speakers express this and indicate their true intent? What types or variations of expressions are there? How many? Are there many forms of this? Is this a type that is frequently used? Or does it not matter because it's clear what's being discussed? And why or why not? (This question might be more appropriate for English Language & Usage, but as far as I know this site deals only with grammar.)   Thanks.  P.S. There are lots of types of indirect/double-entendre/sneaky questions. But there is none that I can think of which asks, specifically, what an Atn can do. Does that exist? It could, in theory, ask whether they can go into the bank/office. Would it be better to ask that type?

It's often accompanied by the word 'how' or by a question about why someone did something.

In the first example, it is more likely that the speaker is making the comment about a number of different things than a single specific event. The second example is most likely a factual and not a generic comment.
It is always better to use a more specific statement as a question. For example „I am getting charged for this, but I can‟t imagine why…„ This will help you focus on one specific aspect and the statement will be most specific.

@Chris, I think you are making that assumption because you believe the verb phrase ""find my password"" means the same thing as the noun phrase that follows it, ""my password"". I have been unable to locate such an usage in any dictionary, and I'm not aware of any such usage. It may be possible for your example usage to be considered such a usage, however, since many dictionaries use a hyphen between the first and second parts of compound nouns, but I cannot find such hyphens in the definition of ""password"", ""can't"" or ""it"". Therefore, it is not possible to make such assumptions. The sentence: ""Find my/It's/My/Your password/etc."" is an uttering of that verb, not the phrase after it. There could be any number of meanings for that phrase. If that statement was intended as an actual question in that language, then the only answer might actually be a single phrase, rather than a phrase with multiple components. But even then, any of the possibilities would be entirely possible. You would simply need to ask your source about that. As it stands now, there is no way for this person to know what is meant by:
""Can't you help me out here?""
and no-one can know that either, at least until it occurs, unless they are there at the time to hear him/her speak. In that case, you can simply ask to clarify the meaning of what was said, or ask them to repeat it so you would have a better idea of how it was meant, though if they don’t seem to remember it accurately and you feel like they might have misunderstood you in some way, that‹s when you might want to contact the authorities or a lawyer.

@user1317, The answer you provided is very close, but it's wrong. ""Password"" isn't a noun, so it doesn't have an article (""a"" or ""an"") before it. This is because the word ""a/an"" means belonging to, or part of, whereas ""the"" and ""it"" mean something different. So, you're looking for ""A password isn’t being accepted and I need it to be reset."" It's not incorrect but, it just doesn‘t work as a sentence.
It would be something like: ""The password is not being recognized, and we need for it so to reset it""

646,Something Is Wrong With My Password.,Considering this utterance: Something Is Wrong With My Password. What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:
This is a common error message to appear when a user tries to change their password without changing the password of their account first. If you have forgotten your password, all you can do is reset it by emailing your email address to password recovery@example.com from the signup page (see instructions here). If this is due to having lost your old password you must contact the service that issued it, such as your bank or email provider.
If this happens to someone who has lost their email account, the best thing to do would be to reset their username or the email on their Google account. Once a password is recovered, their previous account and password can be recovered at http://www.google.co.uk/mail/ (if they had previously signed into Google through their gmail account). See instructions on this page.

(A)  An attempt to reset the device for which the password is wrong? (i.e., it is asking if you want to wipe it, etc, and it will do so if yes is chosen)
   OR
 (B) An acknowledgement of a failure to input the correct code (or it could be both) and an indication that there's something wrong with your passcode? In this case, what is it doing wrong, is there a better alternative for the word ""wrong"" than ""is wrong?""
Please let me know, it would be greatly appreciated.
PS: I have tagged the question as an ELU question since I think it's a common English usage question.  If not, please let it go. (I just noticed this was tagged English) I'm also willing to delete it if someone thinks it belongs elsewhere. Just let us know. Thanks!
Edit: My question seems to have been misunderstood or I was not clear enough... I don't care if this is an Android app or an iOS app. I just need a word that means, ""The password you entered was wrong.""
P.S. Please don' t mark it as a duplicate because it deals only with Android and I am only interested in the meaning of ""the password was the wrong one."" Also, I did search but the questions are not exactly similar (the other questions asked for ""this is a wrong message"" and are about the use of the passive form. Also I know the phrase ""something is not"" but it doesn't have the same meaning as ""passcode is"".
Also I would like to point that the original question asked was: What are the nuances that define a ""false"" versus a false positive when doing a computer security check. This question deals with only the ""word"" of pass, so I feel we should stick to the specific and narrower meaning (for the sake of clarity I also used the example ""you have entered a password that's wrong,"" which I hope is more specific).
Thanks,
Ranjani

E) Help with resetting my mobile password (iPhone and Ipod touch) F) Reset password on iPhone G) My iPhone forgot its password H) The password for my iPhone is not changing I) iPhone Password recovery
What is this text? Is the user trying to explain how he/she can unlock his/her iPhone if the PIN is forgotten and the phone is locked? Or is there is no actual forgotten PIN on the iPhone? If no, what should go in place of ""PIN""?
I think we would need to be able to discern the different meanings.
The other options are:
2) What password is used for your mobile device? 3) Can I recover my phone? 4) Your mobile's passcode is reset 5) To recover a phone passphrase from an Apple Device 6) Is my pass code a code 7) Recovery key for an iPhone 8) Password for iphone
This is a long sentence. The options for each one of the above questions are listed for you to choose from. If you need more choices, you can write your own sentences, and make up questions or questions you do not know. Then try to guess the best answers.

When a student is asked to answer an essay question, they are expected to choose the correct answer by giving its intent. I am not sure if this is my problem here. So, in case, you can help me:
Intent of the following sentence: 
'I Can't' is 'A', 'Not' can be 'I do not'.
Is this statement true? What does it mean that I'm being asked an incorrect answer for the essay?   (Note: the student did not get an 'out of 100' mark as they were a beginner and only scored 4/30.)
Any help would be appreciated.  Thanking you in advance. All the best. :)

650,Can I Be Given A New Passcode?,Considering this utterance: Can I Be Given A New Passcode? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I'm trying to figure out if this is a request for a new passcode, or if the speaker is just asking for permission to change the pass code (and if so, should the question be: ""Are you sure you want me to give you a totally new one?"").
Also, I'm wondering whether the sentence should be reworded so that you can figure that out more easily:
Can I be given a password? Is it okay to have a different one (than what I have)?
Is it ok to switch the password with no reason? If I give it a reason, it better be a good one.
Does it have anything to do with this thread (this one):
Do I need to keep or change a long forgotten code I had when I upgraded to the new iPad and iPhone? and is there anything more to it about? 
This would make a much more useful question. Is this a duplicate? I don't think it is because I already know all of the answers in this other thread. There are a ton of answers and it seems like a community wiki. This is why I am asking it again, because a lot of people are asking this question without knowing the entire story."
651,I Do Not Know My Passcode.,Considering this utterance: I Do Not Know My Passcode. What is the intent that best describes it?,"I think in this case the utterances intent is to express his feeling and his opinion that he was unaware of the password which was his concern for the last 4 years.
The utter sentence I think has the purpose to describe his condition which may lead to the consequence of his lack of knowledge."
652,I Don'T Remember My Code To Get Into The App.,Considering this utterance: I Don'T Remember My Code To Get Into The App. What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:
In the past, I have often thought I was remembering the words I had used, but it was just a dream. This is just another case of this.
The word 'code' is a little hard to remember. There are so many of them. The way you remember this could be an important indicator. Perhaps you think it to be'something that I can type on a screen'. Or you could think that it is something that is on the other end of the line. It is not as difficult to imagine a line as you'd think.  You could have been looking at the 'key' and 'lock' key combination, the one to lock and the number 7 key, or a picture of a '7' on your keyboard. You don't have a physical picture in your working memories, and it could mean you are recalling your own code as a combination. As you get older, you may remember a bit less, so try to get back into the routine of remembering."

654,Why Won'T My Passcode Work?,Considering this utterance: Why Won'T My Passcode Work? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is the speaker talking from inside his or her own mind, or from the listener's own inner mind? If they are speaking from their mind the answer is most likely that their code is wrong. But if they can't help you because they don't even know why you can only enter their phone by giving them your code, then the correct answer to your question is, Why won't my code work?

		If a person doesn't have your phone code they will not be able to gain access to their number or your account. This is what the statement, ""Why won' t my passcode work"" means. The best way to think is that the person did nothing wrong, but something prevented him or herself from completing what would have been a correct procedure.

This is an example of a conversational statement that has a clear, single meaning. 
The statement is not ambiguous, and the meaning is simple. It has the most direct, least abstract meaning possible. As such, it's not a ""question"" in the true sense of the word."
655,Can I Resent My Passcode?,Considering this utterance: Can I Resent My Passcode? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The first thought may be to answer: ""Can I resent my birthdate?"" However, after thinking more about it, it becomes apparent that the real intended answer is ""can I feel resentment towards my own creation?"" That is, can I hate my life, my family, and the world around me just because I was born into it in the first place. It is a very interesting question, but not one that is usually raised in this conversation.

If this is indeed the intended question of the post, then perhaps the author should have titled it ""How I Can Resolve My Feelings Toward My Birthdate!"" and not ""I Can't Resign My Password"". The reason why I chose to use the latter title is that it is not the same question as the former. The former question is asking if there is anything we can do to resolve our feelings about our birthdates. As such, the answer to this question may include things like ""change your birth date to make a positive difference in your life"", ""live every day to the fullest"", etc. On the other hand, ""Resign my Password"" is actually asking about a specific thing to do and an action to take in order to accomplish this. So, what does this suggest to me? That this article is missing a step in it's message. Instead of asking ""how can we change our life with our past birthdays"", it should be: how can you change your past birthday with your current life? So instead of changing your birthday, change how you live in a way which will make your experience better with the way you perceive your world. This way, not only are you accomplishing a change in how things seem to exist in time, you also are doing so in such a manner that changes the past into the present. In this way it would be possible for you to experience the future. That's a pretty cool trick to pull off, don't you think?

656,I Need To Reset My Passcode. How Do I Do It?,Considering this utterance: I Need To Reset My Passcode. How Do I Do It? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Intent Classification: Intent Classification is a machine learning concept used to categorize the user’s utterances. The classification model is trained from various intent utterings, including all the intents that the model needs to learn such as ‘Help”. In our case we have 6 intensions that we need to detect in the utterations.
We use the Stanford NLP Toolkit‘s intent classification API.
Our utter_intent function will return an intent with the confidence of the classfication. This is useful in case the detection was unsuccessful. For example: We detect intent A and B with equal confidence => Intent A
This means the users have sent the same message to both A & B. However, the system could classify it as B because of a bad confidence and we may need it to retry the request. We can get better performance by using the more confident classifier with a better trained model."

This is all I need to learn. How would you decide? Thanks
If A: Then I would say that the sentence is written from the standpoint of: ""I want this person to do it for me because I can't.""
That's just the way I see it. Is the other person a boss or an employee? I'd like to hear some other thoughts on this as I find that this question has made me somewhat uneasy. Thanks. =)
Thanks. For some reason, I think I should choose B. Can someone help? =D
It's not my intention to offend. And it is, technically, not a grammar question, but is very important to the English language. If B: then the whole purpose of asking in English would be moot. So if B, then I'm afraid the question does have a slight grammatical question to it! LOL Thanks =o) I guess the right way to word it would just be 'What's the best reason to choose option B?'

The most common error is that you're not supposed to use help me to ask to do something. If it's a password, just change it! But if you really want to ""reset the thing"", I think you've got to call the manufacturer or provider."
659,I Have Forgotten My Passcode To Access My App,Considering this utterance: I Have Forgotten My Passcode To Access My App What is the intent that best describes it?,"I have forgotten my password to access my app and want to change the answer.
My app is a social network where users can log in using their credentials so that their friends can view their profile. In the log-in page, a user enters their name and password. After submitting, they are taken to a verification page that requests them to check their phone number via SMS. The user checks the phone using a mobile app, and is then sent an SMS containing a link that can take them back to the main login page. 
What is wrong with the utterances ""I forgot my passcode to log on to my account"" or ""My password for this app has changed, so I want a new one""?
Which of the following sentences will best describe the user's intentions:
1) I forgot the password of my social-network account so the I need to enter a username and a password in order to login to this account. (Passcode is not mentioned in the sentence because it would be obvious from the context).
2)  I have forgot to provide the right password when I tried to verify my phone by logging out of this social account (the app doesn't require the users to have a verified phone). It is now asking me for a different password so as to get a login link. I am entering it now. Please provide me a phone. My intention is to send it an sms so it can verify it. This is all I know.

EDIT: Thanks for all the answers guys! Great learning experiences.
My final vote goes to ""If i can' t get the passcode from my phone, i should call the police""
But I was looking for more of a definition or explanation. Thanks!   ;)
The best answer would have been a ""What do I say to the security personnel"" but sadly not enough people answered this! Thanks everyone again for the time! Much appreciated. It was a great learning experience. I really appreciate your insight. :)
And thanks for clarifying the rules! It's nice to know that my answers were correct. Again, thanks! This post helped out a ton. :D
If this had been an ""English for Dummies"" question:  If i cannot pass the code to my iPhone, I should go to a security person. This is incorrect. You should ask what do you tell security when they ask you what to do. If it fails to pass your phone to your account, what should you do? You can also say ""Please pass my password to X"".
This was my last edit before this being posted on ELL! The final answer is from @Gwendi, the only one who got it on the last try. She had it right all along! Thank you! :3

(and how do I know that they actually are possible?). Please don't write the entire story, it would be a bit lengthy.

I know what I am looking to do. Just not sure what would constitute a valid answer. 
In my mind, the answer could be something like this:
A: ""The device is locked. It must be reset in the settings. Where can I reset the password"".  If the question is asked to a friend of a relative I might say something on the order of: 'Where the heck did you buy your iPhone? Did someone install a security program on it for you?'
B: The settings are in Control Center. You will find them under General Settings -> Control Centre Settings. I think you can reset this from there. (this might be too simple, but it's something I thought of that could work)
C: I don’t know. Maybe Apple will tell you on their support website, or in their help system, etc. If you don
   t know about this, then you‘ll have to call Apple, and they will
tell you. Or maybe someone in your family will know the way to
change the number, because maybe you have an old iPhone that had
this feature before the TouchID feature was added. The way you do
it would depend on your old device. But that would be another thing
to be found on a website or support page, that you should look for
there if you are unable to find any other way.”
D: None of the above. That‚s the wrong way of talking to the person. He may be an idiot, so if he doesn„t
know what to answer and he isn‛t going to look it up, he may not know an answer at all. So don'‹t be so hard on yourself."

A possible solution: You could start off with a phrase like ‘Can you help me with my device?‘
Another solution would simply be to ask if the person wants to assist you with your device, and to then ask ’Are you sure you want to help? I‟m really not sure. ”

664,What Steps Do I Take To Receive Another Passcode?,Considering this utterance: What Steps Do I Take To Receive Another Passcode? What is the intent that best describes it?,"In other words, to what situation/context/situation has the uttering agent/utterance being used as a response? Is there any context that might help us to know what it is referring to? How is context used to interpret an utterant-agent? What steps do you take to receive another passcode when you're at a store? For example, when a waiter gives you your food at the restaurant, what actions do u take? I'm sure you do it in a different way depending on the situation or context of what is being presented. If I get a call from my bank, I would say the steps I take are: Step 1- I'll answer the phone; Step 2- When I answer I will look at my phone to see if it's the bank; and I'd press '1' for my account number; then I do Step 3 - which may be to ask them if they're calling me; or I could go on to say something like 'thank you very much, thank you so much for calling, it must really be important; I know it can't be good news, so I think I can guess what this is about.'
Step 4- Then I might say it. I guess that's it; Thank you for the call, bye."
665,I Forgot My Password,Considering this utterance: I Forgot My Password What is the intent that best describes it?,"My guess: You are using the phrase on purpose, as a way of making a point or a joke; perhaps you are trying to convince someone of something (you are going to ""get away"" from the ""bad thing"", for example).
I don't like that it can be taken as literally true; you don;t just ""forget"" your password. You also have other passwords you use, and that are less important, so you may not be able to reset it.
If you truly forget your account's password, then you can probably contact customer support, where it will take a few weeks to set up your new password; so it's probably better just to not say it in the first place."
666,I Forgot My Code To Get Into The App.,Considering this utterance: I Forgot My Code To Get Into The App. What is the intent that best describes it?,"This has been the same question I have asked myself for the past 2 days. As a programmer, I’m very familiar with the concept of programming code, so I would consider that to be an oversimplification. I don‘t think I can simply say I forgot, or I didn‚t remember, because I believe that in context, my sentence implies that the code is forgotten or overlooked, and that is not the correct interpretation.
The context:  
I forgot my code to get into the application.  I tried to log-in, then tried my phone number, however, it did not work. When logging in using my work email I was unable to complete. The system is unable
to send a notification via mobile application (Iphone) to tell me if the person who tried the number is still registered or not. This is a problem for me. Is there a way to create a loop to check for a phone/email notification?  Do I need a separate code for this? I did try the solution that @jamesqf suggests (which is to send the notification through a server) but it doesn‰t work when it is done on the android application as well. Thanks for your help.

It seems obvious to me that the answer should be 1, because, if the intention were to use a similar password with some service, it is unlikely that one would bother giving a different password.

If you are asking if you can reset your password, which is typically a single use of the system (or single action), than you would have no idea what your old password was.  So it's not possible.
However:  There are a couple of ways to get the login info off of your account, and it is possible to know what it was if they used the right method. For example: if someone is able to brute force you into the reset form (by repeatedly entering known password until the web form tells them it worked), you might be able get an email with the username/password. And of course, brute forcing can also be automated, so this is only true if the attacker is trying out different logins."

So is there a program on Mac/ Windows/ Linux that can help me to reset this pass phrase?

What I did after the answer from ""Gonzalo"" and the comment from @dasblinkenlight: I searched on Google for the following phrase:  ""reset an passcoded iPhone"".  I found 2 different programs which I was able to use: Reset my iP[hone] passwd. In the description it says the program ""re-sets the four-digit numeric passw... (2 replies) Reply to this email, if this does not solve your problem."" And the second solution was an online tutorial and it said ""To reset your iPhone's pass codes to a factory default pass key.""...So I will use the tutorial as it seems more reliable. Also, from the comments: It has to be a new pass. So, as far as I know there are four characters (digits) and a symbol. This way I can not be forced to choose the symbols and digits. Thanks again!
Note: If it was possible for someone to see the actual passphrase as a string of digits, letters and symbols or if they were to have access to the text document or email or the code itself. Then they could use any software program (like the two I mentioned above) to brute force the password....This is how hackers try and hack in (by brute forcing) passwords.

675,Tell Me How To Reset The Passcode.,Considering this utterance: Tell Me How To Reset The Passcode. What is the intent that best describes it?,"a) I’m a user of Apple products and I want the user interface to reset its passcode on my Macbook”
b) “My iPhone has lost all my passcodes. How can I reset it to default? (I don‟t care if its factory reset or not).“
c) Both, but both a) and b) are valid and the best choice for the sentence
d) None of the above and we need to get rid of it
My understanding of this sentence is:
Apple devices like the iPod, the iPhone, and Mac can be „locked„ or ‚‚reset‘ by the manufacturer with the help of a special password. The user can lock or reset the device himself using the factory defaults on the operating system. He can also change the pass code for a limited amount of times. However it is important to note that Apple locks or resets devices by default. So there is no way to unlock a ‰ÌiPod, iPhone or a Mac.
The question is, how would you use the correct ‟‹Äì. I think the answer is c) (b and a are not correct). This sentence shows that there could be a need for ‖‰iTunes, which has to deal with pass codes and reset them (in a way)

676,I Am Still Waiting For A Money Transfer To Show,Considering this utterance: I Am Still Waiting For A Money Transfer To Show What is the intent that best describes it?,"I can tell you what it is: the money was sent in error. It was never actually sent, and never will be. I do not intend to have it show in my account.
But why did I say that and how can this situation be avoided in the future? I am still waiting for the transfer to appear in order to avoid any confusion. However, I will not wait for eternity (or a long time period).
What I want to know is how do I tell someone that I did not want the transaction in question, or was not happy with it, when I have actually received this money? Do I use the words “I’m not sure if” or ‘I wasn‘t happy“ or something else? How can I get around this?

678,I Am Confused As To Why My Transfer Could Still Be Pending.,Considering this utterance: I Am Confused As To Why My Transfer Could Still Be Pending. What is the intent that best describes it?,"(1) A) To make a joke, or B) to express frustration or annoyance with the fact that you didn't know anything that could affect your transfer.

In my own personal experience, I have found that the best way to describe this is to say I'm annoyed about this. This is because I tend to use the word annoyed rather than confused when talking in this context, and the latter implies that I was thinking about something else entirely. Also, it's not something I'd say in casual conversation, so to my way of thinking, annoyed is more appropriate."
679,How Long Does It Take For A Money Transfer To Show?,Considering this utterance: How Long Does It Take For A Money Transfer To Show? What is the intent that best describes it?,"You want to know: when will my money transfer be accepted in my account
or account balance after I send it.
This is usually the case if the sender does not know the exact amount of
the money he is transferring
and is therefore asking for an estimated amount. In the same way, the
recipient of a transfer is asking if he can get the money. But there is
an important distinction. The recipient is not asking ""How long does it take
to get my cash?""
The question that the recipient of cash wants to ask is: ""When will I receive it
into my bank account/wallet"".
So, it is clear why this is called an ""ESTIMATE"". The question in this
situation is very simple, but there are actually
2 questions involved, one of which is about the amount,
that is, when can I get it?. This is also often called
a ""PALPABLE ESTIMATION"" which has a different meaning to ""estimate""."

685,I'M Tired Of All The Problems I'Ve Had. I Want To Quit This Account!,Considering this utterance: I'M Tired Of All The Problems I'Ve Had. I Want To Quit This Account! What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it a statement of fact? Or a declaration of a desire?

What is a problem? We can only recognize problems when we are able to identify them.
A problem is something that you want to have changed in order to achieve a specific end. What does this mean, exactly, for a writer? You have an idea, a story, or a series of stories...you set out to get it on paper. Then, if you are working with any kind of plan, you come up with various points that will need to be changed, and you need a way to tell which of them, which ones you will change, to what degree you'll have to change them...and you have a list of problems. You can also have the list if the story isn't yet finished: you know what needs to happen, but you don't know how to make it happen. In either case, your problem list consists of the problems that need changing in your story. Your goal is to solve those problems by finding ways to address them; in other words, by making the necessary changes. As you go through your list, some of you may have more problems than others, depending on the degree of difficulty in accomplishing your goal of writing. Some of your problems will take a certain amount of time and effort to resolve, others will require more time. All of this will happen with varying degrees of success. If the problem with your first draft is, ""The writing stinks,"" then you might find yourself adding more and more to the end of it to try to disguise what's gone wrong in the first place. When you're done, how do you feel...happy? Satisfied? A little frustrated, perhaps? It all depends, because in writing a novel, the ultimate goal in mind, is not writing, itself. It is writing that is as close to good as you can make your writing while still maintaining the quality of good. This means that at every turn in a writing project, whether its a short story or long novel - in both cases, it's the finished result of what you've done that matters, not what happens along the way. But it also means, as I just said, that some parts of that are more important than other. So, I ask a final time: What did you mean by your statement? Was the statement"
686,Please Delete My Account Right Now!,Considering this utterance: Please Delete My Account Right Now! What is the intent that best describes it?,"I want someone to delete my Google account immediately. I am tired of all the spam and other nonsense that Google is serving me up!
This sentence is ambiguous
Please Delete my account right now is grammatically correct, but I believe that it is very poor English, and that the best expression of this intent would be:
Would you please delete this account? If you delete it for me, I promise not to come back to Google ever again.
or
Could you, for my sake, please remove the account that belongs to me here? [point to the Google search box]
So please, which of these is best? Can anyone shed any light on this please? I find my English quite good, in fact quite very good. But on certain topics (like grammatical structures) I can use some improvement, so I hope that this question is not deemed too off-topic. It has only one comment as of now. 
Thanks
P.S I apologize if this is an improper post, as I didn't see any tags to make it more appropriate. If there are any, then feel free to edit this to add them
Note: I also noticed that I forgot to tag this as a ""listening comprehension"" problem, since that is what it really is. The grammar was not the real topic of my question in this case, it merely helped to form the question. Thank you
PSS: Also if you have any suggestions on how I should go about fixing any grammer-related problems that remain, feel at liberty to comment. Thanks
Update: The question has been migrated to ELL. Please see the comments for more details. This is my first question, hence my ignorance as to how to handle comments
Thank you  

  *  Thanks @LennartRegebro. My original question was ""can this be fixed or is it a mistake"" and the comment is about the latter. So, the issue is really about grammar, not about listening or something. Hence I think I have made my point that ""this is a grammar not a listening problem.""  (Sorry I did not make this clear initially)  Now, regarding the other question about tagging, yes, this could be considered off topic. As I said, though, that's not what this particular question had to do with. In my original post I had not mentioned that part at all"
687,I Want To Close My Account,Considering this utterance: I Want To Close My Account What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is the speaker trying to communicate: ""The speaker/I want to terminate this transaction.""
or:
""I am trying not to continue this activity""
How can you tell which it is? (I would guess the first one, since ""To terminate a transaction"" is an action verb, and ""Not to start something"" would be an adverbial)
Thanks,
Joe
PS. ""Closing my account"" could also be interpreted as a noun and be used in the 2nd way: the I want/try not use the account for a certain reason. I wonder in some cases, which of the intents are the most common or natural ways to say it, that you could be asked to clarify. Sometimes, a specific verb/part of speech in context is sufficient to convey the meaning. The most typical use case is ""I have nothing to spend,"" when it's implied to be a ""negative action"" that has nothing ""positive."" It's not that I'm suggesting you say, ""Have you nothing,"" it just that when I hear people say ""Spend"" I tend to think they're trying (not) to have or want something positive. But it seems to work in this case and the context.
Also, is it possible that if the sentence is said in a negative, it can still be understood as ""trying to not continue or not start""? Or do those meanings imply the same, even though they seem unrelated? I would assume both sentences (1) & (3) mean the the ""same"".
I hope this makes sense. Thanks
(P.S. this is probably a very common use of ""want"")
PPS The word I originally tried to use was ""don't"", but I realized that would also mean ""to end something."" ""Don't continue something,"" is what I think I wanted to express. My question was not specifically about ""no,"" so I thought it might be helpful to get an answer that might apply to many other words. Maybe a little redundant, but hopefully not confusing. 
PPPS: Sorry for the long-winded intro, I hope I didn't put too many thoughts into it. :)

688,"Unhappy With You, How To Delete Account","Considering this utterance: Unhappy With You, How To Delete Account What is the intent that best describes it?","Is it to make the listener feel unhappy, or to express displeasure at something someone has done to him, something that he is now feeling upset and uncomfortable about? If the answer to either of these inquiries is 'yes' then the speaker might be trying to upset his listener and cause him emotional harm. On the other hand, if the reply is No' both questions, then this expression is probably a response to something the person said, rather than an attempt to cause the upset. If this is so, the purpose is to inform the individual of something he or she said that makes the user unhappy. This can be used by anyone and is usually directed at someone they are close to, even if they have no intention of being angry with him or her (in this context I'm thinking back to a few weeks ago when my wife and I went to an Irish music festival, where there was a live band with a singer/ guitarist. The singer was in the middle of a song and stopped mid-way, saying Unhuh, I hate it when that happens and walked off the stage). In addition, there seems to be no real 'purpose' behind this form of expression, as the sender cannot think of anything specific he would like done or not do. It is merely some kind of 'general''mood', which he wants to display to those near him. I can't find any real reason or purpose other than it is just something some people do, like a grumpy face or a 'hippy' expression. There seems no reason for it and yet there are hundreds of thousands of people that find this a useful and very effective means of making others upset or annoyed with them.

How could one use this statement? Well, you can use it whenever you want, to tell a friend, lover, family member, co-worker, neighbour or anyone else to whom you feel the need to let them know about something. Of course, this can only be done if one trusts that the recipient will not take offence. However there is a risk of overdoing it, which is why some would use a less direct phrase. For example you could use: You've got it wrong there. My name is not 'John Smith'. Instead of saying: I was not happy with the way you just described me. You see, a simple, direct statement will usually make your target feel a little awkward and embarrassed,"
689,I Would Like To Delete My Account.,Considering this utterance: I Would Like To Delete My Account. What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:
As a native speaker, I would probably say: ""I want to delete my account."" The way I see it, this is similar to ""de-activate"" or ""suspend"" but you can always re-enable a suspended account. I don't know what a delete account might mean, as I didn't encounter any context that makes sense to me."

Or is it possible that the company in question is you and you are trying to express that fact? Is it also possible you simply want to delete your account or have you had a bad experience with the account?




I believe in the former case the statement would be a declaration of intent. If instead it's just you who said it, it would sound more like a passive-aggressive, unplanned comment. But if it is in response to an action or statement, you could have intended to say it in a way that's more of an aggressive statement."
691,I Don'T Like Your Company. Delete My Account.,Considering this utterance: I Don'T Like Your Company. Delete My Account. What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:

If it's only the latter part of the statement, then deleting your account doesn't have anything to do with your statement; in fact, you could delete all of your accounts in a company and that would still not remove your dislike of all the company.
To delete your company account, go to the account settings page and then click ""Delete account."""
692,I Would Like To Close My Account.,Considering this utterance: I Would Like To Close My Account. What is the intent that best describes it?,"In my opinion, the answer that makes the most sense, or the one that the best fits my criteria:
1. If I was a native speaker (as in my own first language) and I were to give this speech: It would be: ""I do Not Want To"", because that's how I feel inside of myself. I don't want to, so I'm not going to!
2. ""If I had to say this in a third-person I would say: He would like to close his account"".. because ""He wants to"" doesn't make sense to him.

699,How Do I Get Rid Of My Account Asap?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Get Rid Of My Account Asap? What is the intent that best describes it?,"It may be as a question, a statement for clarification, or a command/order. It must be analyzed as one of these three. In this sentence, the speaker is asking for your opinion of a plan. For example, ""How do you know that's right for you?"" or ""I think if we did this, it would work.""

Sentence One: This is where you will use a verb, such as ""know,"" ""think,"" or any verb that describes an action. A subject is an actor that does something. Examples: ""You are an excellent artist. Your work is so beautiful."" or, you can write ""He is a genius."" A sentence starts after ""The"" and ends after a comma.
Example two: The second sentence begins with the word ""It"" (The third sentence will begin with ""it is""). The subject does not start until another noun. The example would be, The dog's tail wagged. Another example could be The sun is shining. Sentences are usually a group of 3 words where the first noun starts the subject, second noun describes the object, and the third noun is usually the verb. Example: My car is red. I'm driving. She is talking. You are a bad boy. He will get what he wants. If you use the past simple tense of the sentence (as in these sentences), the action does take place and it is over. To describe the event as it happened, use past continuous tense (the present tense). This can be seen in the following sentences: He is playing a video game. This event is taking place right now. We are talking about the future. Tomorrow, he will play. My friend's house is very interesting. Her house was built in 1890. His house has been standing since the early 1800's; it's very old. There are two main ways to combine sentences. They are called coordinate and subordinate clauses. These are explained in detail in your text."

The intent of the uttering isn'f 'delete my account.'. Instead, the company, in the mind of that utterer, is 'not good enough' for him to wish he could delete the account.
(There are many other possibilities, like: ""I can't be bothered to sign up to this,"" ""This is too difficult."")
My question is, which of those possibilities are most common? Is there a general rule to use when describing the intents of words like this? It seems that people would say things like ""this company isn"", or ""that company sucks"" to describe negative things. But is there more nuance? Are there times and situations when you might use one over the other? I'm trying to get some context, and I'd appreciate some help. Thank You!
Edit: To make a better point in this sentence:
-The Company in question has a bad reputation with many people. (Is that a common way of saying it?)
It is a negative feeling I have that is more than just a simple statement of preference. It's as if, for the person, it's not really ""their company,"" it is ""the company that's bad"" and ""it's the companies that aren't good."" Is that what you're asking? 
To give a clearer example of what I mean. If someone had a really negative opinion of ""Apple"" (they are great, but they're not my favorite either) then they'd probably refer to Apple as being ""bad"" for being bad. On the flip side, if they had great feelings of Apple and they wanted to say ""They're good"" because they like Apple, then that would be the case that I think is happening to me in my example. I like the feeling of being at the opposite of an Apple fan. Or, as another example, say I love Apple but don't want to pay for iTunes. Then the statement that iTunes is bad for ""being bad,"" is my feeling.   I would assume in those situations I use 'bad' to mean that the feelings are negative. In the Apple example I am saying ""they have a good reputation and reputation is very important to people"" so I want people to be happy with Apple because their reputation speaks for itself."

702,I Am Not Satisfied With Your Company And Would Like To Delete My Accounts!,Considering this utterance: I Am Not Satisfied With Your Company And Would Like To Delete My Accounts! What is the intent that best describes it?,"In this paper I present four alternative approaches that can lead to different solutions to the problem of classifying IAM utterances into three semantic roles: 'I', 'That', and 'Not'. A semantic role is an abstract notion that represents a semantic contribution that the utterer of the IAD makes to a sentence. I argue that in order to capture the complexity of IARs we need to consider more than just the semantic content of a given sentence to determine the meaning of it. In particular, I consider IAS as a key factor in classiﬁcation, and propose that this can be better described in terms of what kind of information a speaker provides and intends to provide to an hearer, as opposed to what a hearers presupposes and assumes about the speaker in making sense of their utterancies."
703,Please Delete My Account. I Am Not Happy With The Service From Your Company.,Considering this utterance: Please Delete My Account. I Am Not Happy With The Service From Your Company. What is the intent that best describes it?,"If the person is making the utterances with intent to harm, then the first part would be “Intentional Damage”. The next part of the charge is ‘to the prejudice’ of another. It is very important that this part be considered. If it is merely annoying someone the second part could be changed to ” Annoy“.
It is not enough to say that someone is annoying but that they are doing it with malice. This means that it must be done because that person wants to be annoying. One who is annoyed with another, but has no ill intent of any sort is acting as a passive witness. They are simply observing what occurs. There are degrees of annoyance so it would not be enough for there to merely be an annoyance that there is harm in mind. You may wish to consider that the harm is to the company and its goodwill. In that case the charges would need to include harm to another with ill-intent. For example if the complaint was ’to harm the goodwill of X‘. Or if it was merely ‹annoyance with no intent›. That would depend on what the nature of your business is. Is it a social networking site and you are annoyed that one person posted negative comments about your product? Would you not also need harm for example slander? Or in your case, defamation? This is a case where the law requires a lot of thought and research. An attorney is really needed to do this and it will be necessary to hire one quickly. Otherwise, as I said you may end up having to pay a large settlement or go to court and take them to Court. Either may be too costly and result in a financial loss of a great amount."

As this is a question about communication you could also consider asking this on The Communicator, which is about Communication and related topics. You will find some users that are very good at giving helpful answers on this site as well. Just take your time to read some of the messages there and you will know what I mean. And, if you want, you can also start a discussion there. There are some people that do not like discussions because they prefer to give you the information you need. They will give good hints to you. But you have to search for them first, that is why we have users with high karma. In fact, this may be a good reason for you to become a member of The communicator. If you do want a more formal approach I recommend to use the Stack Exchange chat. As it is not about the same topic, but about people trying to communicate, the people you find there are often much more helpful than others you would find on the main sites. Good luck

It is worth noticing that this question may also be appropriate for a site for professional Communication or even more specific ones like Speech Communication, Linguistics or Interpersonal Communication. It is possible that someone is able to answer you there as they would also deal with the question on a daily basis."
705,I Am Sick Of This Damn Company And Want To Close Out My Account.,Considering this utterance: I Am Sick Of This Damn Company And Want To Close Out My Account. What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it to express dissatisfaction or a demand to be released?

Is ""I am sick of this damn company"" a statement of fact, a declaration of intent to quit, or what? I can tell you how I would parse it:
(1) ""Sick of"" indicates ""disgust"", and (2) it means ""that I have had all I am willing to bear of that company,"" and so is therefore an expression of dissatisfaction, because if it were a request to leave, then it would mean ""would like to end my association with them. I do not want to continue to do business with this business.""
It is a declaratory statement to make it clear that I wish to terminate my relationship.
On the other hand, ""This damn Company"" is merely an inchoate expression that has no grammatical subject. It just looks like a question, and it is. So, what it asks of the hearer is what do they think of it. And we don't have one in mind, so the statement itself does not have any meaning because of lack of information. The only thing the question tells us is that it's an ""opinionated statement."""
706,Please Close My Account. I Am Unsatisfied With Your Service.,Considering this utterance: Please Close My Account. I Am Unsatisfied With Your Service. What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:
[Intent]: I want an airline to close my account.
B:   You want the airline that closed your account to be the airlines' company."
707,Please Delete My Account.,Considering this utterance: Please Delete My Account. What is the intent that best describes it?,"I.
An example with a different meaning:
This sentence has a negative meaning. It could mean something like: ""Do not delete my account"".
Example: If someone asks you for a favour and tells you ""I request to be deleted from your contact list"", this is a common way, if you want to refuse. If you are not sure, the best thing is to use an appropriate verb to say exactly what you mean!
II. A sentence with no special meaning
It may have a completely different intention.  
A) The context may be different. The subject may not be 'You are', the verb may also be in the form 'delete'.
In this case, it can mean: 'I want you to delete me and my files'
B) An example that doesn't describe a positive or negative action
The subject is not 'you', but it's someone else. In my opinion it does not have any specific meaning, and therefore it doesn´t describe any kind of action. This example could be a request for someone to do something for them, but without any action required from them. For example: if someone says to their teacher: I want this to happen. or I would like that you do that, or someone wants that someone do this. Without saying 'please', it could also mean a question that does describe the action, because the sentence doesn’t end with ‘would‘. However in my experience this happens in English. English speakers are very flexible in their sentences, they can always make them sound more informal, even if they have never heard the formal version of this sentence in that context. Therefore, I believe that this might be the reason why most native English-speakers don” t find it odd to hear this kind or sentence. I also think that they use that form of expressing themselves because 'would' is too formal for certain circumstances, for example, when you ask to someone for help or to them to help another person."
708,"Your Service Is Terrible,.  Delete My Account,","Considering this utterance: Your Service Is Terrible,.  Delete My Account, What is the intent that best describes it?","A:
This utterence: “Your service is terrible, Delete my account.” What does best describe its intent? I will give you a brief answer to that: It is an insult.  But the correct word is insult in this case.
The meaning, however, is not ‘terrible service you are providing’. The speaker wants to give an insulting message and he tries to use an adjective to do that. It has the same function of an adverb which is used in the following way: 
(i) I was angry; I insulted him. (adverbial)
  (ii) He was rude; he insulted me. [He insulted us/me. etc.]
Now, to get back to your question, the word ’Terrible‘ has a meaning of ”horrendous“ as well as „abominable„, or ‚terrifying‚; ‟extremely bad,‹ or even ‐awful. So, if I were to say that my job/service is ※-terribly bad. I would have to ‏use the adjective ‌-awfully."

It seems as though, in the context of this dialogue, the answer will be yes, and for good reason, however, if the account in question is not deleted, it can easily be restored as explained in this article on the Facebook Blog.

How do users interact with the site after they delete their profile (as it relates to social media analytics)? Facebook provides a little insight for those who have deleted their profiles in regards to the time spent on their site following login:
https://support.facebook.com/blog/post/52150
So in order for Facebook to understand that a user has deleted his or her profile, that user needs to log in. However, there are methods to get around this problem, including using Facebook Connect, a feature that allows users to access their account without logging in or being able to see their friends/pages/etc. For example, on a page, use the following: 
$facebook =& FacebookConnect::initialize();
   $facebook->setAccessToken('token value');
You can then access the information in $fb_user and $profile_data: https://developers.google.fr/api-client-library/php/documentation/v2/reference/generated/com_facebook_profilefacebookcoresdk4php5.FacebookProfileData.class.html
It is possible that there may be an issue with this technique (i.e. it could be a security breach), however this should provide some insight."

713,I Wish To Close My Account. I Do Not Like The Service You Provide.,Considering this utterance: I Wish To Close My Account. I Do Not Like The Service You Provide. What is the intent that best describes it?,"If you read it as an action, what will you do next?

In English, as a native speaker, if I read the sentence aloud, it would be ""I wish to close my account.""
As a non-native speaker and one who is looking to be as effective at listening as possible... I would read this sentence differently. To my trained ear, the meaning changes depending on how you view it.
I would interpret that as I wish a bank account is closed. So I close the account. If the bank has multiple accounts, then I might mean that I want to cancel one of their accounts. 
So, my reading of the English sentence is ""Please, close all my accounts."" To me, that is something I'm going to have to do, and there is a very specific context where a client might express a certain emotion, with a different meaning in mind. And, there could be more than one. In other words...
A client is asking, ""What would happen if all the money was gone?"" And the response might be (somewhere in the realm of) ""You may not be able to make a payment on your car""
Or it might actually be   (a lot closer to)...
""What will happen when you have no money?""

But is is possible that you have had a similar experience in which you were given advice that a certain course of action should be taken, and that was not the answer that the individual giving the advice wanted to provide and he was actually trying to help? So maybe the correct answer would be:
Can You Tell Me Why This Is Happening?
Context: you are on the phone having a conversation with an agent who is asking how best to proceed and they gave you some advice, but it was clearly not their best advice and there must be a better way."
715,"I Don'T Find Your Services Useful Anymore, How Do I Delete My Account?","Considering this utterance: I Don'T Find Your Services Useful Anymore, How Do I Delete My Account? What is the intent that best describes it?","The intent is to express a negative sentiment, and the negation is ""I don't find your services useful anymore"". I believe that this negator is a strong one.
In most cases of negators, the object should have an infinitival clause in order for the speaker to be able to assert the proposition expressed within the infinitive, for example:
I like to do a lot of things -
It makes me happy that I can be a great mother. (A negated affirmative sentence)
This is an affirmative verb. It means that you do like something. So we can say that ""a lot"" is doing something, but it is used because we are talking about an action that occurs with a large volume. The meaning is that the volume of the action is large. You can even say: 
*You like a huge amount of food. *You are a gigantic eater.  I really do not like eating a small amount or very little. I do NOT find eating very much food very useful. When we use a negating word to negate an affirmation, we will add the word ""no"" in the sentence. In this case we add ""it is no longer useful"":
"" I DON' T find it no more useful to go to your service. ""
You can see that we do use the verb ""to like"" and it works the same way as ""like"". It can also be negatived. We use ""NOT"" with the negative verb, which is how we make a statement that is negative."

What did my girlfriend put on Facebook? It“s not the first time this has happened but this was the worst. She put up a pic of my 15-year-old daughter in the nude. We are getting a divorce now.

B. This company is a great place to work, you won't find a better company anywhere. You will have great work that you will like to do every day. I wish more people would see how great this company truly is. (I am an Employee)
C. ""This Company sucks"" is an expression used to indicate discontent with the company or the employees. It's used as a warning to the other workers that there's no work at the moment so please don't come to your work station. As long as you aren't being rude you should feel comfortable in using the term. Most of the time this would be used if the employee is trying to get rid of him/herself from the job. If you're working in retail and you tell your manager something like ""The company blows, I just came in here to quit"" then they will probably give you a nice talk and try to change your mind about the situation. There's a lot of people that don' t like their jobs but they have nowhere else to turn. Sometimes they feel like giving up because they think the boss might fire them. But if you are really unhappy and the only way you can get a good job is quitting then you shouldn't be working on a job that sucks. Just quit. That's how you would feel. Also if your job sucks it doesn't mean it will be bad everywhere. Don't expect to find that same kind of work anywhere else. Maybe not all places suck just some. Your job at this particular company might be pretty good and even though you don’t think so you might not see it but that doesn‘t mean that your boss is going to fire you or that everything that happened is your fault. In a situation you need to ask yourself what is really bugging me and why can I fix it. A lot times when people say they want a change of jobs they don`t really need it because the change doesn` t change the way they do their work. So if they can find somewhere else where they work the same way but don""t do it at their job or if something is buggin them in any other way.

Is it: (1) To get my card back.(2) Keep his/her job.(3) Get money for my losses or (4) All of these.
There are some more options to be considered, but I'm curious to know what most people think. My own opinion on that matter, is, what if I had just lost $20 or $30 on a bad transaction? Do you think that is worth getting upset at a store or bank? (I've never lost a card on purpose, and have never seen anyone else do this.) I don't want that person to lose his or her job, so I'd like to consider my options. I would prefer not to give this company/store any money, though, as I do not have much. So what would be my next action? Would it involve getting in touch with the company, or something else? This may sound like a silly/stupid question, I just like having options! :P
(Sorry if this is too long to put all my question in! I tried to cut out some unnecessary parts!)
Edit: This is an American ATM card
Thanks in advance!
Also, this question is NOT about whether or not the person stole an ATM. It's about this scenario at an Automated Teller Machine. Thank you! :)
*Edit* It also has to pertain to the state I live in. (Michigan)
EDIT2:
I guess I should clarify that the ""stolen card"" is what is really important, not that there was an actual theft. That is why I used ATMs, since they have a PIN and are not open/public. And if someone did steal the card, it should be pretty easy to trace, right? Also, the only ""card"" I have is a ""credit card"", as my real card was damaged and doesn't work.

I don¡¯t know whether it¬¿s possible or not, but it may be a good idea to try using the terminal of your phone. If the phone works fine, the card should automatically be transferred to you when you return to your home.

What is the intent that best describes it?,"(A) I had the purpose that was necessary to acquire the money and my card wouldn't remove from my hand. (B) My purpose was to have the ability to take the cash and the card from that particular area. This is an example of a conditional with a ""if...then"" statement. The if part in this example would be ""If the situation was as I thought it was, the result would have occurred"". The then part of the conditional would follow and would describe the next thing the speaker or writer wanted to happen.

I have to say I think that the answer you have given is quite a complicated one, so my answer would simply be that it would depend on the circumstances of who is saying them and who you're speaking to (I suppose it should really depend also on your intention as it's clear that one could interpret a person's actions differently) but I'm not sure you should necessarily take that as an answer to this question as the question seems to be asking something like 'How did the person feel when they made the utterances that you've mentioned?' rather than necessarily to answer the 'what was he thinking?' and'what was his intent' which is what I believe you are trying to do.

@Lateral_transfer I suppose the difference between ""I was retrieving money"" and ""my card would not remove"" is that by the second one he would never actually get the opportunity to try and do the actions mentioned so I don't think it really matters if the other person would interpret the first one as a statement of purpose or as actual action and intent would the two things be any different? I guess what you may be trying and I can't help but think you might be a bit too eager to provide an explanation.

This is a great way to find out what the user was hoping to happen, and if he/she wanted the action to take place. For the sake of the example, let„s assume this is an action the User would want to cancel. If so, he can now state the request by saying, For example: „I wish you to [verb] this order now.‟. When an AI agent receives such a request, we can assume that an order has been canceled. We would then ask the bot why it cancelled and what it has done. In other words, how did the AI do it and to what effect? If the agent is to provide an explanation, it will most likely say something along the lines of ‚I found out it was too expensive. I therefore cancelled the order. My agent did so because I found this out because my AI system decided to give you a message. Please check out my [website].'

It also seems like it'd be useful for someone who doesn't know a lot of the lingo to know that 'atm' means an ATM. However, if someone did know this already, then it seems a bit redundant. Also, in order to convey 'how to', it may be necessary to include a verb with what you mean, but in a manner of speaking. So, you could say, how to make the more out the walmarket, or how do I make more from my walMart card, etc. There may not be anything wrong with being vague with 'Atm', but I don't think it's the best choice, especially because there are plenty to choose from. Any ideas? Thank you!"
727,I Think The Atm Ate My Card.,Considering this utterance: I Think The Atm Ate My Card. What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is the card still in your pocket? Do you have a new card? Was your card just in the wallet? Did you not look at the bill? Does your wallet not have money in it, because it was eaten? This is a really good question to ask, and the answer is ‘No’, there was no intent to eat anyone”s card and certainly not the one you just gave to me. There is no such thing as a card “eating card“, this is an invention of the Atman in which you give the impression of having something, but it is in reality only a manifestation of an ego which has no existence beyond thought, for thought does not exist apart from its object. The atman is also a part of your ego, therefore in this case, it would be like you having a tooth „eating„ you card.

I would say in most cases, when people say ”I thought the ATM ate my card..‖. They have not been able to realize the actual intent behind it. It is more likely that they have been thinking ″I have lost my credit card″, ‹but they haven‘t.› They had just put it in their wallet which is where it should be..
When you say, that ’the ATM card ate your credit cards‟, you are talking about an actual physical object, which does exist. You are saying that it ate a physical thing, so therefore, the thing is still sitting there. Now, if this was the case (it didn―t ate it), then it could be said that, your intent was to have the credit in hand (because of you‚€™s ego), and you were only thinking, «I lost it! I thought this thing ate the plastic!». This does—t mean anything, except that your thought process was based in a false premise. In truth, none of this happened, only your thoughts did happen, or rather, they manifested in physical form. So it can be seen that the ‚thought process‛ in itself is illusory, since it cannot manifest in any physical or nonphysical way! There‍‗only your thinking can, as it relates to the physical world. If this were to be taken literally, then one could say that a tree was thinking about"

731,How Can I Get My Card Back Out?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Get My Card Back Out? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This utterances are used to describe the situation of: 
1- when one can't pay in public places (e.g., at restaurant, movie-theater, etc) and have to pay another way such as cash or card;   2-when you've forgotten your card and you want to go back and buy it.
For 1, it could be:
""Could I get back the money I've paid in the restaurant?""
or
 ""I'm sorry. Can you bring back my card?""  (I think this one might work even if the person doesn't have a card)
(or)  ""How can I go to the ATM to get more money?"" or ""Can you withdraw money and send it to me by post card at my home address?"" (this one sounds a little bit weird but you might get an idea from how I worded it).
2. the utteranced that are usually used in this context are in order to find the card (or to return it):
*""What's this?"" is a common question for 2.  Or: “Where are you looking for?” (it's a kind of question to ask the one who's looking).  It could also be  a way of saying: ""Is it yours?"" Or ""Do you know that (thing)?"". (In my case, I would be asked:) Do you have your credit card with you? (And then I could say: it's in my purse). I guess for your situation, this type of utterant might also work."
732,The Atm Machine Stole My Card.,Considering this utterance: The Atm Machine Stole My Card. What is the intent that best describes it?,"The Atmel Atmega8 micro controller is a highly popular 8-Bit microcontroller, especially for the Atmegas and ATSams due to it's affordable cost of production, availability of a large number of libraries for development, and its ease of programming. However, this ease-to-use comes at the price of one. The micro-controller requires a special tool to program it.
You can find several options on your favourite electronic market, which are:
Arduino (a low priced clone of the atmega micro),
ATtiny (the smallest 8 bit micro)
MicroChip (The original AtMega micro is still the most popular), which I think was sold out at most online stores, but there is also an new smaller version called Attiny2313 on the official microchip website. (I would recommend the 2313 over the 328 for your application.)
So if you're looking for an 8bit micro you can buy without a programmer, you have a lot of options. But if your main objective is to use the Arduino IDE and develop programs using the same IDE for Arduino micro's you are not able to do so. 
As of March 2014, they only have one official AtAtmega Arduino, so if we were discussing if the micro had the functionality to be able be programmed from an Arduino (or a clone) you would be looking at a false statement."

2. This one was a little bit different. The subject had a problem with his credit card. We will refer to this one only as A.

It's ok if we don't have the card today, right...?
Is that what's supposed to happen or is this a scam? I thought this is a legit problem. Is that the reason they said ""confiscited"", so they could charge my card on my behalf??
I've never had this problem before. I don;t want to have it again!! I just don’t feel like this can't be an isolated incident to me, it happened to him yesterday at the same location and same ATM machine. Please help me out!! :)
Thanks in advance!
-T.O.L.H.C.Y.P.N.S
P/S: This has happened only once to my husband's friend, so it's not a frequent problem at all. We were at Costco together yesterday for the express purpose of having the problem, that is why we called him immediately. He doesn't want the bank to charge his account as he has no other cards and doesn‚t understand the concept of a bank account. But we have to do it by law and there is no way the ATM company or even the store can help us. :( :(
The store is in the mall, not near an actual ATM and has never been a problem for our other friends and relatives that have used this atms before and after this incident. The only difference that I can see is that we were there last time during the night hours, this time we went there during regular work hours. Also we live at least 10 minutes drive from the nearest bank so I would definitely assume that this wouldn't happen to us again unless he would have a reason to go near the atmc in a very short period. :) :) The store we tried this yesterday is not one near our house or within a reasonable distance from us, we had to take his wife with us to make sure this would happen at that specific location.

738,What Do I Do If The Atm Ate My Card?,Considering this utterance: What Do I Do If The Atm Ate My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"If you look for answers on Google then there are thousands of hits with all manner of conflicting information.

I can think of many different scenarios of this happening. It could be that you had it in your purse, your wallet at work or it was in a hotel room safe and you don’t realize it until you got home. The fact is that the information that is on your credit cards and ATM cards is valuable to thieves. In many cases the cards do not provide any security and just an access code to get into an account. For this scenario you need to know how secure is your system. You will need a system that provides secure remote access and secure PINs instead of just access codes. If the thief gets into your home you may not be able to stop them from stealing your information by taking it with them. Most of the time you will be told something like, “I need you to fill out the card and put the new card in to verify” but in some cases it will ask you for verification information right away. This is when you must protect your account from this type of theft if you do nothing. Once you are in this situation and it is too late then you can‘t do much to recover your identity. All of a sudden it seems like it would be very simple to do if all of those scenarios I just named didn‚€™t happen but as you learn here, it can. Protect yourself now and not later because in the worst case you never have a chance to. There is a lot of information about fraud and identity theft on the web so take your time and look at everything. I will also cover this later as part of our discussion on securing your house."

I’m going to use your ATM card. I will spend money.
Or: I‘ll use ATM. It“s a good ATM
Does it seem to describe a similar action? Does it say what I expect to be true? No. My expectations of what it should say are different. The first statement has a definite purpose. If the second one said “still has my card” I would still be surprised to learn they had my ATM Card, I don„t think they‟d have the ability or desire to do it. That‡s why it‚s surprising, and that‹s what we call the „surprise‰ of the statement. We say ‚still have.› 
Now, look at: He has some more cash. He still has. Can you describe him‭? Yes. You see the cash? You still have it! He is still the same. Do‪ you expect anything else? Not really, he still ‫is‮.

A:
[0] This is a statement.
I think the statement you're referring to is ""How do I know if a card has been stolen from my wallet?"".
There's nothing wrong with asking about how to interpret statements in context - we just need to keep in mind that if we're not sure how it fits in the context, we need some sort of context. A single utterances on its own doesn't say much of anything. 
We have some context: You've got something to look into. You'd like to know the answer to that question. The context of the question might or might not have a particular answer. But it's hard to tell without seeing the rest of your question or knowing the full context from which that statement has come.

What is the intent that best describes it?,"The first thing to determine is that it is really a request, not a complaint. The second step is to figure out where the request fits into the ""whole picture"" of things going on around this person. Is the person upset that he or she is not being treated like other customers or that their card is being taken away? Or is this a case of someone who is upset about his or her circumstances and is trying to get attention? And is there another reason or motive for the problem? Is there any way the card could be pulled out of the cashier's hands and still be acceptable? The last part of this exercise is what the reader does. You have to imagine the other person inside your head and determine how you would think, act, and respond to this situation.
""I Can't Pull [insert your choice of verb here] My [Card | Card Number | Atmos Card] Out of The [name of atm] And Get Away with It!""
If your reader is thinking: ""You should have thought of that first,"" then you will need to give him or

744,Why Would An Atm Swallow My Card?,Considering this utterance: Why Would An Atm Swallow My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"You are probably thinking of this as one of the stupidest questions ever asked, as it is a statement with little logic or meaning, and probably just a bad joke. But I am asking you to take a closer look at a sentence, that is an example of what I have termed 'the art of language'. A sentence can be very difficult to understand if we don't know what the speaker is trying to tell us, how they are trying it, or their meaning.
My question to you is this: what are the possible meanings of What Is The Intent Of An ATM Card Swallowing? I will give you an alternate title to my question. ""What does it say about you?"" (That you are a poor communicator, a very poor reader of context, if you can't read these lines.)
A little background: The title is from a conversation that took place yesterday, between one person, me, another person a bit closer to myself than anyone else on earth at this moment. That person was a student of mine, from about 20 years ago, at an advanced level of study, perhaps a teacher in some respect, he is now retired from all of his previous occupations. The conversation lasted about an hour, during which this student asked a few questions. These questions had no relation to the title that I had chosen, but I could not resist the temptation to use this title, so I did the best I can. When I asked what it said about him that he couldn't answer such a basic question, with such easy logic, I really didn't expect the response I got. He answered, quite honestly, ""I was surprised at how little I know about my own mind.""
He is still learning. (I am still being kind to him!) He is very open to learning, to understanding himself and the world around, very receptive and receptive, in a way that we, the people around him who were in the'real world', were not. This was the first time I saw that, ever, even though I've known him for a while. I suppose it's been there, lurking around the corners, for many years, before now, when I found it and saw it in context. It's not a quality that the vast majority of people possess, because they never had the chance to be around people that were more open, than we were. Most people think they"

What is the intent that best describes it?,"My friends say, it’s because you are mad because your card was taken. It‘s not that I‟m mad. Or, I got mad at the atm because it took my card. The second is an acceptable, grammatically correct interpretation, but it lacks a certain amount of emotional nuance to it. For some people they will use this one: The at is not fair.

This is a perfectly acceptable way to interpret the phrase and express the intended emotion. But it doesn”t capture the subtle emotional nuances of the sentence as a whole. When we say that something is ”fair“ there is some degree of acceptance that the action that has taken place is something that is right or that we can understand. You may not even be aware of that subtle nuance in the statement. We can often get around or „over-read„ the situation and create a false conclusion. This can lead to all sorts of problems. In most cases, when we‚Äôve done this, or said this to someone else, we will feel guilty. Why guilty? Because we haven‡Å‰Ëed ourselves. What we did was wrong. However, what if we felt guilty for not doing something?
We have learned to read others emotions. Some of us do it naturally and others need help. Emotions run rampant through all of our interactions. If we know how to control our own emotions, can we really help others? Can we truly say we don•ÇÑt understand someone if the answer to this question is yes? So can‹Ö¸¨ÈÚ¬Ï¾we really say what we feel? No. Is that so bad? Perhaps not, maybe it is good. I don't know. Maybe that›ÆÐ³Ò´Ù‪Ü´¥Þs something you‒À‿òù¹Â´d have to find out by your own means!

If this is what I'm trying to do, then can you imagine how well this may work? I will use the following technique of ""Visualization"".

748,How Do I Retrieve A Trapped Card From A Atm?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Retrieve A Trapped Card From A Atm? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This is a rhetorical question. The best answer to your rhetorical questions is usually ""It depends"" or ""What do you mean?"" It is difficult to know what the speaker wants you to do because we are not familiar with their intent.

This utterances is an indirect request. In most cases the request is to give an answer. For this to be a true request you must answer the question you are asking. Therefore, ""How do I retrieve a trapped card from the ATM"" is not a request, but rather a statement or question that is being asked. You must assume the context of this sentence. When you assume a context then you have the opportunity to determine if the statement is true or false. This can be done in different ways including using the five basic tools of logic as you see here: 
1) Is the sentence in its entirety true?   Yes
2) If the part of speech of a word is singular then it is in the subject.  (How Do)
3) The predicate of an independent clause must be in present tense or past tense (Retrieve)  In this case the tense is present, so yes. It's in active voice. So the answer is yes it's true. Or in other words, Yes (The answer) is always true, if that part is said in that form. (Or) yes is just another form of yes, the same as ""yes"" in English. We can use ""no"" instead of ""not"" when we mean ""Yes, except"". Or we can just omit the word entirely or use the abbreviation (eg. ""nix"" meaning no).  If you don't know the correct form you can find it with a simple Google search. If I use an abbrevation then I usually use something other than the ""real"" abbrev. in order to make it more clear (or funny) if you ask me why the letter ""e"" isn't always ""I"".
4) Do the words in a compound sentence have related meanings? I know you think this doesn't make sense. I assure you, it does. And I will explain how here. Imagine if your friend asked you something like this instead: ""Do your parents hate cats?"" The sentence is asking for a yes or no answer, just as I asked above when I said Yes, or Not, is"

No, no need to be worried. Everything is alright. There is money in there. Let‚Äôs enjoy some time and let‟s relax a bit. (It is not the right place to use the words like I don„Æ¬Ìget back,”¤‡¹.

751,"If My Card Is Trapped In The Atm, What Do I Do?","Considering this utterance: If My Card Is Trapped In The Atm, What Do I Do? What is the intent that best describes it?","This is an important question! I’ll give you some examples of intent in this case and I would like for you to think about how each of these may or may not work in the real world.
What we‘ll be doing is taking some common scenarios that people often ask me and apply different ways of interpreting the utterances. I am going to make this very simple for the moment so we don”t need a lot of examples. The first case would be:
If I have a stolen credit/debit card at my location, do I call my banks for help or do nothing? I mean what is my intent? Is my focus on the stolen card or on my current location? What do you think? We need to decide first. In this example I choose “I have my cards stolen, so I should call for some help“. So I will call the bank‪‬. We don't need the card atm number› anymore. Is the next question „is it ok to use it again?‰. If this is a good option, it's obvious that we would say ‚yes‹‚no‟„. Let's take a look at the third case. My phone is lost at your store, should I make a call to you or to a friend to have it fixed? First think it over. Which of the following options would you choose? ‭‭

He might also simply want to be able to say My card has been swallowed by the atm in order to avoid further conversation. Or he might simply wish to get some free money, as in My Money has Been Stolen by an Atman."

What Should I Do Now That The Bank Is Closed?,Considering this utterance: The Atm At Metro Bank On High St. Kensington Didn'T Return My Card. What Should I Do Now That The Bank Is Closed? What is the intent that best describes it?,"In the present tense and in the simple past tense, the word ""to"" in an expression or question is a relative pronoun.

To is used to express a reason, purpose, cause, result, or condition. It is also used in expressions that begin with ""in the,"" such as in ""In the atm at Metro, I don't have enough cash."" When you look up ""why did he leave?,"" you are looking for the reason that he left. You would use ""because"" for that purpose. ""I didn't know he could do that!"" would be a response in answer to, ""Why did you do this to us? Why did it have to come to this?"" You could ask ""How did I fail?"" and you would say ""Because I failed."" In answer you might want to say, for example, something like ""If I weren't tired, if I hadn't been ill, If I were stronger or faster, my grades would have been better, so it's my fault that I didn'To be able to do so, she is in a situation where she has to. She is not allowed to go. And the fact that she can't go, that is, in that context, is very relevant to the question. In English, we sometimes use this word to mean ""if,"" when we want emphasis. The first question I asked is: ""What is this 'to' here?"" And now when you read this sentence: To get the correct change he went to a store. He went into the store and asked for an orange juice. If you want a different answer, you need to phrase it differently. For example: If he had only had some money available, he would ha. To be used with an indirect question: Do you know what that to is? To mean 'because'. I was asked this while I worked in high school: Are you sure you have the right to answer my question, because if there is someone with more experience than you, they can also be wrong. As I got older, it became obvious that the teacher was asking the questions to try to test the answers he or she suspected. Now, when a teacher asks a question like this, students are often asked to write in their answer the name of the student or the"
756,There Is More Than One Of The Same Transaction On My Account.,Considering this utterance: There Is More Than One Of The Same Transaction On My Account. What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:
I'll take a quick stab at this...
""There Is more than one of the same transaction on my account""
means ""There is more then 1 transaction that was done by my own hand on this account.""
That would mean someone has been doing the following.
First, they create a transaction, and then it goes through and gets approved by a bank employee, who makes it into a ""confirmed transaction"". Once this transaction is confirmed on the account, it is now on that account. 
Then, someone gets in the position of needing money, but does not care about a confirmation, so they just click their way through the process of getting the transaction ""in there"" to be able to get that money. This person could be a child that is being a parent, or could also be an adult that just needs money for a car and does a charge card fraud to do it. The only thing that makes a difference is who has the money the transactions are on. It is possible for an account to have 2 transactions of this type on it, one for each person that does the fraud. But it could just as easily be 10 or 100, because the person just does as many frauds as they need to until they get the cash they want, whether they steal from one account or more (the fraud can be in any denomination, just be for whatever the card is capable of).
So now there is a situation, for the purpose of your question, that would be this person's bank account:  There is 1 of each transaction type. (If they got in trouble with this they could simply create more transactions.)
If this was for example, a checking account that the bank does online and you did it with a credit card, there would not be 2 accounts for this situation. If you went to the store to make the purchase you could make more or a different one."

A:

 I have a duplicate payment showing. It is from one of your recurring payments that has been manually approved, but then the user tried to pay it manually, and the system is giving you an alert."
758,I Made A Payment That Got Charged Twice Instead Of Once.,Considering this utterance: I Made A Payment That Got Charged Twice Instead Of Once. What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:
This type of utterances occurs because the speaker has a mental picture of a series of payments in his mind, but he speaks in the past tense because of the time delay in communicating this to another person. 
So it is not incorrect to say this kind of sentence but it can be awkward.
It is just the same with the other kind that you have mentioned. For example
I bought the car in February and it cost me a thousand dollars in June."
759,What Are My Remedies If I Think I Was Charged Twice For The Same Expense?,Considering this utterance: What Are My Remedies If I Think I Was Charged Twice For The Same Expense? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This question is asked to get the reader to think and to analyze what the author's intent is. The author seems to be asking the question because he wants to know if there are any consequences for being charged twice for the same expense. Another way to read this question might be: Was I really charged once for my expenses or was it something else? The speaker seems unsure of what he was actually charged for so he asks if this is what has happened to him. He then says ""What are my remedies"" if his charges were double.

A:
If we read the passage literally, we could easily see the answer.  The sentence is saying that the speaker, thinking of his expenses, has double-charged them. In this situation, he does not need to use the ""remedies"" because his situation would have been bad enough that double charges would be appropriate. But if you think about it, ""what are your remedies?"" is a strange choice of phrasing (in English at least). If he had meant ""Are you going to double charge me, then?"" he would say, Are you, instead of What are you?
The context would indicate that he is trying to figure out what exactly he has been charged. Since he doesn't know the details, it seems he's asking rhetorical questions (he is really just thinking), not really sure of the true state of things."
760,Can I Verify The Source Of My Funds?,Considering this utterance: Can I Verify The Source Of My Funds? What is the intent that best describes it?,"If you are a regular on the forum you will have seen this phrase used on numerous occasions. Most of us know what he is trying to do, but it still requires explanation.
The intent is a form of double talk and is used by the con to deflect or deflect any question about the nature of the crime that he committed. So it is not an easy phrase to analyze. To help analyze this type of speech, we need to define two terms;
1. Verbal Doubletalk: Is the use of words that are in their simplest and common form, while meaning something entirely other. A simple analogy is that when you say, ""I am sorry I have to work tonight,"" your intention is to say you don't have time to chat, and you have not said it with intent to hurt anyone. Whereas when someone says it, they are talking about getting laid, having a good time, getting drunk, or having sex. When someone talks this way they have verbal doubletalk. In other words, the person saying it does not mean what they say it says. But in fact what is being said is exactly what someone who is more intelligent and educated than the listener would expect to hear. It is called verbal doublespeak. See: Verbing Words,
2. DoubleTalk: The act of saying something that is untrue and which cannot be proven. As such it requires the assumption of trust from those who listen. This is because if they were to call a bluff and ask for proof it would be considered an insult and a challenge. Therefore when we talk about double-talk we are not referring to the verbal use, rather to its use in the form or double dealing, in which the truth can be found by asking for it. The classic example being a bank robber holding a gun demanding all of their money. They say they will shoot you if you do not give them all your money, as such they double speak saying they won't shoot unless all their demands are met. However, if the bank does open up its vault and gives all the money they do shoot. That is double deception. We see the same double talking when the government says that they believe that Osama Bin Laden is in hiding, yet no evidence has ever been offered in support of this idea. Or the claim that the US did not invade Iraq. Again the claims made are untrue, however this time the speaker has not told a"

762,Where Are My Funds Being Sourced From?,Considering this utterance: Where Are My Funds Being Sourced From? What is the intent that best describes it?,"(The following is a transcript from the video.)
""It is my intention that the fund raised and received from friends, family, associates and business associates go to this fund. It is an important fund because it is going to help people in our community.""
What is ""this fund""?
And how is it ""important""? (It sounds like it's important in a different way than money is important: e.g., it sounds important because a ""fund"" is something that's associated with people and community, and that would make it important.
Is this what it means to mean ""an important money fund"", ""a fund that matters"", etc? What are the examples here that it could be applied to? (I mean in an English conversation.) I am having a hard time picturing a scenario where someone says ""It's an X fund; it matters."" 
If I said I had three different ""money funds"" and I wanted to explain which is which, how would I do that? How would that help me make my point clearer?  Or would it just seem redundant if I tried to make a point using three terms that each describe the same thing in some way? It seems like I might be able to say that this third ""X"" fund I'm raising with friends is very important, but I don't know how the word ""very"" or ""impressive"" are best used. Or maybe it would be better if the funds were only one.   I also have the example of ""I need money for..."". Is this the correct way to do ""need"" with money? Or does that not sound natural? Are other phrasings more common, or more acceptable than what I've given? Thanks. (This example is from a real conversation - sorry if there's a grammatical mistake.)  ""Where are my money being sourced from going"" means ""from where is this money coming?"" ""From my friends"". So that is what makes it different, then? The other person didn't want to know the source? In a situation (in real life) where people don’t want a source to be known, does this mean that they are hiding money from their friends? Is it acceptable to ask people ""where their money comes from""?  What other kinds of money sources can be used? Could this include a money pool? This could also be"

A:
It depends of the context (speaker, conversation, etc.) It can be any of those sentences.
If this sentence is spoken by an adult it can just be 
""I would like to know who I am getting paid for the hours I put in here"".
Or if this is asked by a child (young) it would be

764,Where To Funds Come From,Considering this utterance: Where To Funds Come From What is the intent that best describes it?,"What emotions are evoked? How do you feel? I’m going to make an assumption as to the emotions that were evokes: pride, excitement, and joy.

Now, in our world today, we see a lot of things that are not always what it says, but what emotions do we feel towards them? For example, the United States has a very high income. However, most people have a low opinion of the U.S. because it‘s not seen by people that it is indeed a wealthy, strong nation. On the opposite side of our spectrum is India. People around the world look upon the poor people in India to be “basket cases” and to have nothing. Yet, a recent survey of people around India said to think that the people from India are actually happier then the average American. So why is one country seen to a wealth whereas other has poverty? Well, it may just be the fact that money can“buy› happiness. But is happiness something that you can have? Or is what people feel happiness for a fact the result of how they were raised? In this video, I will be addressing how our feelings, how we„re raised, can change what emotion we experience during an event. To understand the concept, let‟s take for example our childhood experience with a toy that we loved, or a food that had a special taste. That emotion could remain for the rest of your life because of its significance in your childhood, even though it was a happy event and that toy was the best one. Another thing that I found interesting when I was doing my research on childhood memories, is that those are the times when our mind is developing. Those memories are called early memories or as some refer to as our „first‛ memories. The reason these memories stand out to us is because they are imprinted in a certain way into our head, as well as, our body. In the first 3 years of life, your memories will take place and your brain will build itself around that experience as a part of itself. Therefore, to change how a person thinks, feels, behaves, etc. in their life is going against the process of brain building. You see, what your child experienced when he was 5 years old is very different than what he felt in his 3rd year of age, than his first year. This can be"

(emphasis added)
It’s not so much a question of intent, or the source, but what you wish to do. In the example you gave, the subject of “funds” is ‘I Need $‘. Therefore, in the sentence ” I don‟t have funds“, it is not necessary to state ’the source  ′
. It is enough that you are making a statement of lack of resources or means. If I said it, „I don't have enough to pay it now,„ it makes sense to add ‚at this moment ‚, because I am saying that what I lack is time. Thus, if I then say‌ ‫""It is better that I borrow $ from this friend""‬, then it would probably be better to include the word ""from."" 
If you‛re saying you need $ for something that is happening right now and that your friend is lending you the $ to spend it on (say, a dinner party), it‡s okay to use either term to communicate the need.  
‫If the thing you want is some money, and you already have the funds to get the cash out‭ ‬of your account to make the transaction, you can‰t really say, ""I need X"" ‰to borrow the X you have in your wallet‮. (That‹s a different conversation from a friend who says ‛I owe you $100, can you pay me back for that?')"

What is the intent that best describes it?,"I want to pay people a reward because I believe in the idea of reward or I would like to donate money in an act of generosity. Both of these sentences have a positive connotation.

A third way to determine the meaning of a word is by looking at the sentence. Look at how it would sound if you said it out loud. If it sounds like ""I want my money"" ""This is my idea"" or ""You're wrong"" then it has a completely different conotation. These sentences convey a different meaning. It may be a request, it may have nothing to do with you at all and only be something the one you are speaking to needs to hear. The best way is to practice with the language. That way you can understand how the words you hear are used in different contexts. Also, reading can help you. I suggest reading at least a book by a native writer or listening to an audio book."

If you choose A – you need to ask yourself how does that information affect your choices on election day and the following two years of your term as representative. If you chose B – how do you feel if you know your opponent has money backing him? Do you consider his opponent is more qualified than you?
Is your candidate running for you or for himself? Is he your advocate or your adversary? Does he need money? Why does he? How much? Who is giving it to him and why? If he is receiving campaign support from a particular source of money and you are suspicious you should ask some questions to determine if he has an ulterior motive. Why don’t I believe his answers? What gives your reason to believe he”s not telling the truth? Are you more familiar with the source or more comfortable with that person? Could you ask about his past record as a legislator and if this particular legislator has had any conflicts? Don‘t worry, if the situation warrants, the candidate will give you specific answers. This is your election year and it is not too soon to start asking questions about your representative and his campaign. It will be time well spent."
769,How Can I Check The Source Of Funds?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Check The Source Of Funds? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What does it mean? To check the source of funds is to verify that they are coming from an actual person or legal entity. In order to have this verification, there must be a source that the funds came from. Therefore, if they came in through the mail, they must have been sent by someone. If they were sent via wire, the sender must exist.

This is an important question because it is a way of knowing if someone is being truthful when they claim to represent someone or something else. There are many ways that this question can be answered. For instance, you can send them a message, ask them about a business, or call them and ask to discuss business. Another way to check that someone really is representing an individual or group would be to look at their website or phone list and determine if there is more than one individual listed that represents the same company or person. This is also done in order for there to be one point of contact for each individual so that it can make it easier for the recipient to contact the intended party. It also allows them to make sure the person is who they say they represent or if it was the actual intention of them contacting this individual. So, when thinking of this particular question, think about why you are contacting these individuals that will ask you about sources of funding, and how you want to approach them. These questions will help you decide the best way for you to proceed."

But my gut feeling says the following. I have a good reason to say (how can I tell) my money is my personal money, and I say ""my"" to imply ownership, but it could mean that I may have borrowed the money (in which case I must get permission to tell who borrowed it).
I may also say that if I can't tell you where the source of the funds is then I cannot tell how much money I've received in the last year (which would also imply I didn't have enough funds to buy a computer or a car - I might also borrow the amount to cover the cost of a new car), I could say the total I gave away last month."

D. None of the Above

772,Can I Find The Origination Of My Funds?,Considering this utterance: Can I Find The Origination Of My Funds? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is this statement a statement of fact or a request and/or wish? I have come to the conclusion after many years of practice that it is not possible to ""find where your funds came from"". There are a lot of people out there ""claiming"" they know but I would have to say that most of them are ""self-appointed"" to their positions. They are all ""experts"" and many of these individuals are in fact in positions of power and influence.

What is even more interesting is that even though they are considered experts in the field of psychic reading they will tell you that is is a ""spirit guided"" reading. How do you know that?
Well, the fact that there is so much ""confusion"" in this area of life it would seem they must be saying what their ""subject"" says to them. If the subject said to him/herself that the origin of the funds was ""Spirit"" he/she would not be so confused. The psychic would then report to you what the spirit said. When a Psychic/spirit reader is ""giving"" a reading to another he, or she, ""listens"" for the thoughts of another. It is quite obvious when the psychic is having trouble ""hearing"" what another individual is saying, then that means that he or her is receiving information from the ""other side"". It would be interesting to know how many individuals in high positions on the planet know the true origin or the source of their funds. There is no doubt in my mind that they do. Why can't they tell us? Are they afraid to tell their subjects? Who is really running this show? It can not all be ""hocus-pocus"" can it!
We have all heard the expression ""You can only be as rich as you are stupid to not see the truth."" It seems the real truth is being held by those that really know and understand. Who do they say really runs this world? We have just been told by a psychic and spiritual teacher that ""We are not living in a world of democracy and freedom."" I find it interesting that someone on this planet has been able to gain such a vast amount of money without ever being investigated, questioned, and challenged. He, she or they is in control and they have control over the people that are making them their money. That makes it all the more disturbing to think that"

In either event, what is its meaning and what should our response be? I'm thinking that its best to just ignore the question as an inquiry.
-Bryan
The following answer is provided by one of our forum moderators as this question seems to have been raised recently...
As you say, the sentence can be taken in at least two ways (and in the latter way it makes no sense at all).
One possibility is that it refers to the source of his money, e.g., a loan or pension, etc. So that would be the right answer to his question. In other words, it seems like he is asking ""How did you acquire my money?"" and the best way to answer that is to say ""I got it from a lender, or else I earned it.""
Another possibility would seem to be that he's saying he wants to verify that this person is legally allowed to possess a firearm, i.e., he could have meant to ask ""Are you a US citizen?"" If this is correct, of course the person would say that that's the case, but it's also possible that there was some kind of misunderstanding. But I suppose there might have also been a misunderstanding about that. I don't quite know."

In a very short order, you get information to verify a source. There must be a way. It's not that difficult to see that there IS a better way to do this. The information needed to answer the question ""verify my information"" may be available if there is an open, public, collaborative discussion. This discussion can be in many forums.   What's happening now?

Tetrakalea is a tool to bring to mind what's going on now. I am a member and I can see what others have posted. http://tetragon.com/  and this is where the Tetra-Mentum is happening. These people are the ones who can make it happen now, and what I hope is that we are all moving to one place, with the same view of the future. Tetrad's are about to be born. You see, what we don't know about how much we really know? What will that mean? I'm not the first to have that thought, but what will we DO about our lack of knowledge, about having only partial knowledge? It is so important that all of us come together as part of one, unified, global movement. One of humanity's greatest accomplishments is when the entire human race came together to fight a disease that was affecting people around the globe. We did it, we made it work together, it was a global team and it changed the world! The World Health Organization was able to identify the pathogen, find the cure and provide it for all to use! We can do that again. Our time, our world, is calling on us to collaborate and solve problems together. That's it. Not in our life time is it possible to know more, to understand more!
I believe the reason for our collective actions are as follows:
First: It appears that humanity is moving from a world of ""individualism"" to becoming a community (the word being defined differently by many), we have moved from being ""in the wilderness"" (living our lives in ""the wild""), to living in a society."
775,I Need The Source Of My Funds Verified. How Do I Do This?,Considering this utterance: I Need The Source Of My Funds Verified. How Do I Do This? What is the intent that best describes it?,"It is a statement that I made. I was speaking about something that had occurred. My intent in speaking is that a change would occur. That is it! I have just described what I am trying to convey in my utterances! This is not something I want people to do. This statement was made because I believed that my life, and the lives of my children, would be different if the statements were made, or the things, which I said were done.

The statement: We must be careful in our statements. Statements must always serve a purpose. If we are speaking of something we believe is happening, then we must state our reasons why we have such a belief. For example, “I need the source of our funds verified.”
We have a need. We are going to go get it. Our needs are something real. There is nothing fictitious about ‘I Need the Source of Our Funds verified’
Our needs must take precedence. They must not be met by someone else. The source that we speak of is an item that is in the hands of people who hold it, either as an employee of a bank, a company, etc. that holds some aspect of an organization; the federal, state or local government or some other entity. These individuals have it in their possession and they have access to it through a system. A system has been established to verify their authority. When such an entity (a bank for instance) is holding funds for the organization, there is no reason to be suspicious that it is being held by a dishonest person. Such a hold on funds is done for good reason. It ensures that the money will reach its purpose, whatever that might be. (Note: Some entities that have held funds that should have reached their designated purpose have become corrupt.)
When we make a verbal statement, the statement must clearly state why this entity needs the funds. In other words, how it can be proven. Because we do not have the item in hand, we cannot be sure that they will be able to produce the evidence. Why they must do this. Simply because they are required by law to. Some of these laws are not well known. However, if we go to the internet and find out what they do, they can usually be found. Most of the time, this does not take much more that fifteen minutes of"

What is the intent that best describes it?,"What was the message/concept that the speaker was hoping to convey? Can you come up with a similar sentence that you would want to know the source for? (This question is not meant to be a grammar question, only to get the students talking, to encourage them to express themselves in their own words, their ideas and opinions in a way of self-expression)

I don’t think it matters if students have a clear idea of what the word mean, if they are clear about the context of the phrase that they used. It is only their understanding, as learners, what is important and they should express what they mean based on their level of understanding."
779,What Is The Source Of My Money?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Source Of My Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it asking a question about how the money is being spent and is there a concern about what it is doing to one’s credit score? Or is it about whether that money was actually earned and if they do not have the resources to do so themselves? Does it sound like the person knows what they are asking and where it will lead to or is just wondering? And lastly, is this a simple question or a rhetorical question because if so, what is a ‘source of money,” and how could it help anyone to determine a person‘s intent?"
780,Where Can I Find The Source Of My Available Money?,Considering this utterance: Where Can I Find The Source Of My Available Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it: I will make my available money available? or: There is a source of my money and I need to find it out? Or: My money comes from many different sources, but there is one source that I can find to help me make it available.

The word available is in a very peculiar state of being for a reason. It does have a special meaning with reference to money that many people may not understand. If your goal is to make money “available” for your business or your family’s needs, then I recommend this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk7j9-2zv_I
As you may have guessed from the title of this post, I wanted to use this example of the word ‘available.‘ I think I would like to share it, for those who haven‟t come across the phrase ’money made available„ before, that it is something that the Universe provides. I do feel that as well as the „money“, the source also needs to be provided. In this case, it was the money I was speaking about. So the question is ”Where can I find the available source?‹
This is what I found for the meaning of available, according to the online Etymology Dictionary:

And this is for Money: http://elex.lumenate.org/cgi-bin/ELEX.cgi?

If I was on a jury and this was one of the questions, I'd probably go with intuitive understanding.

I'd like to know what your thoughts are, if you have thought about this, and what you think would be the best answer to a person that would ask this."
782,Can I See That History On My Funds And Where They Came From?,Considering this utterance: Can I See That History On My Funds And Where They Came From? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What else could be said? It is important to know the different aspects of this sentence because the answer to each question will affect the quality and the content of the essay and, consequently, the grade you can get in this class.

This is a sentence with a rhetorical question, which is an indirect question asking for an opinion. This is often used to ask for another person’s opinion about something. The way to analyze a question about an unknown or a thing is to look at the word “Can”. In this case, that means that the speaker is asking someone else whether or not he/she can see or know or understand something of interest. That something can be a person, a place, an object, history, etc. So, in the original sentence, we are asked to find someone to explain to us what a particular type of history is. We are looking for the past tense, or something that is done in a past time. When I hear the question above, I immediately look for a history teacher and a class that meets every Monday in high school. Then, with that information, it is easy to identify what can we be looking at. It should be something related to the class I took this semester, but it can also be an event that happened in someone‘s life. I believe we can say that a historical fact is any information about someone or events that has been recorded and saved. An historical person or group might be called a historic character because it has lived in an historical period. A historic person might include the leaders of a revolution or important people in your hometown. There are two questions which come to mind when I think of historic people. Who was a famous historic figure? How does one get to be famous historically? There is so much about history that there is nothing in life that can not be related back to it. For example, if something was in history it could have to do with our modern life because we all use and depend on technology. Many of us depend upon the Internet to use our e-mail and to research information we do not have. Technology is used so broadly in everyday life by so many people, so it must have something to back it up or it would not exist, and we could not use it in our lives in today‚s society. Another way of looking back at history might mean a new"
783,I Have To Verify The Source Of My Funds,Considering this utterance: I Have To Verify The Source Of My Funds What is the intent that best describes it?,"Why? Who is it directed at?

I think the first thing that comes to mind is 'I will make sure no one has stolen from me.'
That's pretty much all the money that is left is my family's money. All the rest is from the government. And I have to verify it.
And I can't say the source of the funds are family money either. They are funds given to me by my husband. But he had a heart attack and I took care of him. I am also the one who pays the household bills and so on. So there is no way I stole or used his funds. Even if I wanted to, I do not have the wherewithal to do so without losing what little money I still have left. My husband also has a will in the works where he is going to bequeath all of his money to my two daughters who have nothing but a good name and an excellent character, not a dime to their name. In fact, they have not asked for one cent. It's very sad that I now have very little for them."

So, if you are looking to get an answer... you must ask."
785,Why Does My Money Come From?,Considering this utterance: Why Does My Money Come From? What is the intent that best describes it?,"To express how the individual or society is responsible for the production of economic goods in a market economy:
*The society (government, business, labor) is ultimately responsible
for the distribution of the product.
The individual is not. They can only be held responsible through the law. The
individual can be fined in the case of a crime, but never punished. This is
because fines are not considered punishment, they are merely a way to recoup
the damages caused by the crime. However, in some countries, prison sentences
and hard labor are available if a person has the means of doing so. But
still, it is society that is penalized and not the individuals who have
engaged in wrongdoing. Therefore, one should not say ""I'm going to jail"", but ""Why are we in such a mess?""
Another word is ""laxity"".
""Because of their laxity/ineptitude, societies have fallen to decay.""
- A.M. Smith (economics)
When you talk about someone being lax, you may mean that they let things
happen without being vigilant, or that you can't trust that person in terms
of being careful. So, when I say it about my fellow citizens, I mean
that they have the capacity to be diligent and careful with the money they
use, and it just seems that that isn't something that always occurs. For
example, if you were the President of some country, would people trust
you when it came to money? I think so, since you're a politician. That is,
most people can see right through you, especially if your track record does
not show anything good. You would not be able to keep a secret if there
were no repercussions, so why shouldn't the other person be expected to? For example, this is what happened when the Federal Reserve
created too much money during the ""Great Depression"". People lost money or
their savings due to their failure to watch their money. Then, the
government tried to fix the problem but this created more problems. In
fact, by doing this, people became even more mistrustful of money, which in
turn created a vicious cycle. I'm not saying that there were bad people out
there at the time (there were, just not necessarily people in high places).

787,Where Are My Funds Coming From? I Need To Know.,Considering this utterance: Where Are My Funds Coming From? I Need To Know. What is the intent that best describes it?,"What do I mean? Is there a better expression. This is an uttering from your mouth in which a specific intention is expressed? Or is it a word or phrase used for various meanings?

This is a question that you may be asking yourself a lot. There are many different expressions used to say this, but which one is best to use depends entirely on the situation and the context of the utterances.
Let's use the example of ""Where do you get your funds from?"" which you can use in all kinds of situations. You ask this to someone at any time and it means almost exactly the same thing. But which expression is most used in different situations? The one below is ""How do the finances get taken care of?"". This question is used when someone has a relationship with you where finances or money are involved. The other example is asking ""Who do we get the money from?"". It is commonly used after you have done a favour or something for someone. When the favour has been paid, the speaker wishes to know what or who made the payment, in order to avoid paying again. If you need to explain how a debt came to be, you would use another expression, like ""When does a bill come due?"" to ask who paid to it, or how the bill was paid. ""From whom do taxes come?"". Here, taxes are a form of payment. Taxes are not the topic of this question, which is not used about that. Here the question would be ""What happens to the taxes?"".
A ""money question"" is one about finances, including questions about where the finance comes from, and other similar questions. In English it is difficult to make a distinction between a ""financial question"", ""a question on finances"", or ""about"" financial matters (where the funds are coming from is just one of many financial questions one may ask about).
""Money questions"" do not need a special language or expression; it depends on your context which questions you actually ask. For example, if you are having the following conversation:
1. How much do your bills cost per month? (financial questions: how much you pay)
2. What would you like to have for dinner? - you will say either (1-1) a) how many euros, b) what would it cost, c) which restaurant you want to eat at, d) where would"
788,Where Has My Available Money Come From?,Considering this utterance: Where Has My Available Money Come From? What is the intent that best describes it?,"How would you explain it to someone else?

I would say that it is a question that was asked out of necessity. In this world of inflation, many people have no idea how to get their hands on money anymore because they can't find a stable job. I think that most of us can understand this situation and we would probably all agree that this is not a good thing - so what is there that we can do about this? Well, one of those that have found this problem is Mr. Buffett himself. This is one question he asked himself and answered with some amazing success.
The next step is to analyze the question and to give an appropriate answer. If you take time and make this exercise a habit, you will begin to notice when this question is asked to you. It might even start happening before you get your hands of your own money. So, how would I answer this to myself? I would answer:
If you are having a job that will pay you enough to make a down payment, then I recommend that you make the smallest downpayment possible. For example, if you could have made a $500 payment every month starting from your first paycheck, and if inflation is at 3%, then you would pay $5,250 in 10 years when you start making payments. By making a bigger down-payment, your monthly payments go up, but when they go down, the amount of the down payments doesn't increase. Therefore, in my mind, it makes sense to start your downpayments as small as you can afford as your savings will be used as a safety net if it fails. Of course, we all know that inflation could be more than 3% at some point in the future, so I'd suggest you go with the plan that allows for a small monthly payment rather than a larger one because you'll have the flexibility that comes with it. Now, I know what you're thinking: ""How can I afford a 20% down payoff at today's rates?"". Well the answer is simple. You won't. But by making the minimum monthly down payout, there's no way you'd end up having to pay more, even if your rates went down. To put that into perspective, imagine that a rate of 1% is your inflation rate. Then, on the first month of making your minimum payments, that translates into $20 down instead of $1000. The second month would be"
789,Why Do You Need To Know Where My Money Is Coming From?,Considering this utterance: Why Do You Need To Know Where My Money Is Coming From? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This question leads me to another: Are your parents in the habit or practice of telling you ""why"" they are giving you money? For example: why did she give you this? Why did he give me this for my birthday present? The more I think about it, the more this statement sounds like something we say to our children: ""Because I said so!"" I am reminded too of the old song: Do As I Say, Not As He Did. I find it interesting that this is an oft-heard phrase, and I wonder, who is it you are doing as? Is it your parent? If so, why aren't you acting like your biological parent when it comes to spending your money and your time? You have the freedom to think and act for yourself. It is your life. Your life, your body, is not your Mom's or Dad's. In fact, if you listen intently to their reasons for doing what they do, it will be clear that they don't think for you.

We are now living in an electronic age. Electronic money is coming into the home and onto the computer. This is a fact. My question is; does this electronic money make it less important we know WHERE IT IS COMING FROM? I believe my answer to this question would be No and that is what I want to communicate to you now. You know where your electronic dollars are coming from. The question you must be asking yourself is ""Are you spending that money in a way you approve of?"" If you answer this questions ""yes,"" then you have a lot more work to do than ""just get some paper money.""
If you do not do this, you will find your bank account and other electronic sources of currency will quickly become worthless to yourself and those you interact with because you did not learn how to use this type of money effectively. When you learn to understand and use electronic funds, they will become more valuable to your health, life and peace of mind. If it were up to the bankers and their minions, all currency would become electronic currency. They control the money. That is why you can have only ONE currency, US dollars, at any time. And it is up YOU to convert to something more beneficial to YOU. We would LOVE to share how this can be done; but, until you ask for that, please, stay away. Why do we"

A:
The word 'funds' in your sentence is a very general term and could relate to different concepts depending on the context. However, in this sentence, you can interpret it in different ways based on how the sentence flows. One of them is: 
How can I check where my funds go?
You can ask a bank or a person, where their money is coming from. It will depend on what your context is. You need to ask your bank to know how your account is being funded."
792,Where Can I See The Source Of My Money?,Considering this utterance: Where Can I See The Source Of My Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I think the best way to describe it is:
1) To seek a way out of poverty
2) to avoid poverty and starvation
3) the source of my money is my savings.
4) my bank
5) i have a bank. I have an account in it. It is where I deposit my cash. There is no cash on my person (I keep my own cash and deposit it with the bank).
6) I am rich
7) this is wealth. (wealth and money, they are the same in my opinion). Wealth is being wealthy. Money is a means to wealth, it's the tool for me to acquire wealth; I use my skills to obtain money. Wealth and wealth-making are one in the mind of God. He calls all who seek and pursue to make a better life for themselves, family, friends and for the next generation, a wealthy life, and a wealth life. A wealthy person makes more money then a poor person. When you make enough money for yourself and your family to live better and to do so without working. That person is wealthy, that is living and earning a good money and life is that money coming in. And it also shows that they can spend money on their children, because a person with a big family is rich. Because a rich person have more children than a poverty person does, so this means they have children who can be educated, who have their own car, house, etc. They are richer than poor people. So they make money because of their skills, skills that are necessary to run a family with children. Like a business, business owner who is successful and have good life will have much more kids than the poor father. If the father does not have skills or business to earn more than he can feed his family he cannot have many kids to feed. Thus, the rich has more skills and business. Business owners have money to spend on business and people who work together, make the money that make it possible for them to buy more things than any poor family can get. People are rich and can even spend their money wisely. Spending money in a wise way is to give things to family and other people, which shows your worth. You are a worthy person because you can help people in need or your poor friend. Another way of thinking of this would be to get things or services from a charity."
793,"What Is Source Of My Funds, Need To Verify","Considering this utterance: What Is Source Of My Funds, Need To Verify What is the intent that best describes it?","Is it to ask if they have funds or have they just asked what their source of funds is? If it was the latter it would make the most sense that it is a rhetorical question.
I'm not an English major or anything but it seems like the question is rhetorical if the speaker is expecting a straight answer, but not if that is not what has been asked. But then why would the second sentence have a yes or a no response? This is confusing for me, could anyone clear this up for us? Thank you
Also, why does ""need to verify"" make more sense than ""would like to know"" if it's not a question? Would it be more natural for a native English speaker to write it that way? For example:
""I need to confirm if this is correct or not.""
or
'I would appreciate if you could confirm this for sure before I send the payment""
Sorry if these are simple questions. I would like for my English to improve. :)
Thanks.

UPDATE
Thank you for the responses so far. As you can see, most of them agreed with me that, yes, the meaning is that the answer should be a simple yes/no. That is what I expected to be the case, because I had written the first sentence as a literal quote from a song. The question was, therefore, a paraphrase. However, I have found that even when using a quote, it does not always convey a message literally. For instance, here is another example from the song that I was referencing:  I need someone to talk to, 'cause I'm a real mess
This is how I understood the line, ""I want someone who would love me as I am"" to mean. This does seem like a very literal question, and this time I agree with the answers that they are asking to see if their friend is worthy or if he is in need of help. Thanks again for your responses. It made the article on the dictionary site much clearer than the sentence in my first post. -K   -
EDIT -  Thank to you all again. My sentence was a lot clearer and I did not realize that one could ask this question using quotation. So, what was in the original question that confused you? It's a really interesting line to read about the difference between the two ways"

• I can't help you if you don't provide what you've tried to do, so I'm not even going to answer your question, but I will answer this one. First, your post does not show that you have tried the ""try to find the answer"" route that I suggested. Next, I do not know what ""it"" refers to. Is the question ""why"" or the statement ""where"" your funds originate? What exactly would you like to know? I've read your original question and, in that, no, this doesn't appear to be your intent. I think it's quite clear that this is not the case in this discussion. You seem to think there's one simple answer and you're asking for it specifically. The question I asked is ""Why is it that someone has a particular bank balance at the end of their paycheck?"" and we're answering this question. That's not your intention? Why? Please try to provide that. We're trying to help. But, if the OP thinks it will be easier with just a direct answer to the original stated question then that's a choice that he's making. He can get an answer in one, either here or elsewhere, as long as it answers the one question he wants, not some other question someone else thinks he needs. If what someone wants is answered then, that will suffice. It would seem that what he actually wants to learn isn't answered. Perhaps that doesn’t really answer the actual question or perhaps it does. Who knows? It's the same question we ask everyone. As we‘re trying and explaining here what an audit is we could just stop and ask. There‚s no problem, though, with asking this kind of question if that“"

How would you explain this sentence to a friend, your teacher, or a child? Can you paraphrase this for yourself? (If this is something that is difficult for you, try a different example.)
Example
Consider these examples to see how they could be used:
How can I be sure my company is not doing anything that I don't know about? I can't afford to have a reputation like that.
My mother would be so upset. We are close. How can she find out if I'm being treated well at my work? Is there a way to find it out? Or, is it just a personal thing? Should I even care? If she asked me, can it be a secret? Will it hurt my career? Maybe it's better to ask a third person, like a manager or coworker. Maybe the person will know what to do. Is one person better than the others? Someone said you shouldn't tell. Do any of you know who? Who would it affect? Does it matter who you tell? Would this affect your relationship too? Wouldn't your manager find a good way if he/she found out from another person who works there? You say I should never tell because people will gossip, which might hurt someone's reputation. Or it might be good to tell to the company owner. I will tell them. Can they find you out about the other employee in case he or she is being mistreated there, too, by another boss or manager? Could that be true? It would hurt a lot if people knew about what happened to me in this company, even if my coworkers did it. It might get back to someone I know, someone at school, and then my reputation would really suffer. You think a boss will fire the employee? No. But she will punish him, not just fire him. So will he do it again? This person's actions might even be illegal. This could hurt this person badly. The employee could go to court. If it is my boss, will she be punished too if it hurts"
796,I Was Charged For Something I Didn'T Expect,Considering this utterance: I Was Charged For Something I Didn'T Expect What is the intent that best describes it?,"I think we can safely assume, since it is a legal and professional term, that the charge was not intended as a compliment.

And that charge, ""forgive my ignorance of law"" should be used ONLY when you are not familiar with the law and want to be able to say that you don't know what the consequences of your actions might be."
797,"I Purchased Some Makeup Through A Site In China, And I Was Under The Impression That When I Make Transfers There Is No Fee.  Why Am I Seeing This Fee Now?  I Am Not Happy About This At All.","Considering this utterance: I Purchased Some Makeup Through A Site In China, And I Was Under The Impression That When I Make Transfers There Is No Fee.  Why Am I Seeing This Fee Now?  I Am Not Happy About This At All. What is the intent that best describes it?","A:
In the U.S. (and elsewhere it seems) the ""purchase"" fee on credit/debit cards is called ""merchant discount"".  However, in the UK ""Merchant Discount"" is something else, called a ""Cash Discount"", i.e., your actual payment to the merchant (plus the fees of course) are less than what you charged and the difference is given to you as a cash amount.
It is also important to note that even if the amount of ""discount"" you receive is lower than the fee, that the money you are receiving is ""real"" money in that you did pay for the purchase."
798,I Got Charged And Extra Fee When I Transferred Money So Why Was I Charged?,Considering this utterance: I Got Charged And Extra Fee When I Transferred Money So Why Was I Charged? What is the intent that best describes it?,"It is intended to convey an emotional response, and the speaker may be upset by it.
The speaker could be angry, surprised, or sad. It is also possible that the emotional state of the person could not be conveyed through his voice. For example, in case of a person who is angry or afraid. The emotion may not show on his face. In such cases, one could tell the situation that his emotional condition is similar to when he was charged. He could still be surprised or angry. But his emotion is less than the one when it was the first time. Hence, it can convey the right level of emotion. Thus the question is a valid."
799,Can You Explain The Transfer Fee To Me?,Considering this utterance: Can You Explain The Transfer Fee To Me? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I see a number of different interpretations of that utterant.

This was a good question to bring up on the discussion, as you have brought up several different ways we can interpret it. I have listed 3 (out of many) interpretations and a couple of sentences that may describe each of the different intents. If you are interested, these sentences are:
1. ""Can you explain something to me?""
2. ""(Can/May) I explain...""
3. Do you want a translation for this?
4. How can I help you understand this better? 
5. May I give a better explanation? (This is not a question; a request.)
6. Can you please explain to my wife what I just said? (""May"" in this case is a polite way to say ""ask"")
7. Could please you tell me what he said to you? This can be a bit tricky in English as ""please"" and ""you"" can either be the recipient or the speaker. In this latter case, it means ""to me"" (as in ""I"" want an example).
8. You have a very good explanation for why this is happening. (this is what the original speaker is getting)
9. Thank you for your explanation. This sentence indicates that the ""explanation"" is being acknowledged, so the question is now closed, and the answerer is free to move on. As you can see, each example has different meanings or nuances and I hope you get the point. Please let me know if this helps!
I should give credit where credit is due. The example sentences above were found in an article from http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-common-expressions-for-asking-and-getting-an-exact-answer-to-any-question-in-English."
800,Will Salary Be Received Through This?,Considering this utterance: Will Salary Be Received Through This? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The speaker's intent can best be described as ""salary"" or ""a salary."" 

A:
The question is asking about an ""emphatic pronoun"": one that is emphatic or emphatical in usage. The word chosen here is ""will."" The usage you are referring to here has become popularized in many songs and music videos, and was made popular by the hit song, ""Will the Real (Blurred Lines) please stand up"" by T.I. and Swae Lee. As far as the usage, you can Google it easily."
801,How Can I Get Paid In A Different Currency?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Get Paid In A Different Currency? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What are the key words? Is the speaker talking about the currency of a specific country, or some kind of general currency?

In this case, if someone asks 'How can I get paid in a different currency?' it would likely mean the person wants an amount in some currency other than the current local currency. So the best response would be something along the lines of:
'I would suggest that you use x currency if you can to receive the same amount as if we had been paid using y'.
But in fact, when someone says: 'I want to get payment in x'. The intent is that they are interested in receiving payment for x, not that the payment be in the form of x; i.e., it can be done in another form, but in essence, the intention is to be paid 'in x form'. 
This is why the correct response here is something like:   'If you wish to pay in that currency, you should speak to x about that.  The most efficient way is generally to speak with the appropriate representative in their office.
As always in these cases, it depends on how well you know or understand the local language. But this should give you the idea."
802,Can I Receive My Salary In A Currency Other Than What It Is Deposited In?,Considering this utterance: Can I Receive My Salary In A Currency Other Than What It Is Deposited In? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This utterances is a very common type of language that people use to convey ideas to each other. It is used by most educated people. But, you might be asking, ""Does it really matter?"" It does. The reason it matters is this: The best way to learn any language is to use it.
But using it as written on the page does not allow the learner to become a native speaker. To acquire true fluency, the student needs to be able to express himself or herself naturally and fluently. How can you express yourself if you have not heard someone else's natural and fluent uttering of what you had intended to say? To have that experience, it is best that the person teaching be a fluent speaker of that language. A lot of the time the native speakers are not fluent and their English is not natural. I'm telling you the best and easiest way is for you to get feedback on what your language sounds like as you speak it and see if it sounds natural to someone who speaks the language, who understands it well, and who knows how to communicate with the people who do speak the idiom that comes naturally to you. You want this feedback from native, fluent speakers. These are also good people to talk with, for the same reasons. They can correct errors in your idiolect and give you ideas for new and better ways to speak and convey your ideas. This is because they do not expect you, or anyone else, to repeat a word or expression, as we do with ""You're welcome"", ""No problem"" etc. when we are given something free. Instead, they are happy to hear the expression and to tell you how their culture uses it or whether it doesn't exist. So don't feel like you are taking something from them. Rather, listen and learn from their experience. If you use the ""you're"" all the way through the sentence, then use ""thank you"", for example, that is fine and can even come naturally. That is why you can often see it in the movie subtitles when you watch a movie in a foreign language and they don’t use you're. And, if ""what you said"" is true, why then can the teacher say ""What have you been saying?"" ""Can he say that?"" If ""no"", then it must sound unnatural or incorrect"
803,Can I Get My Salary Through This?,Considering this utterance: Can I Get My Salary Through This? What is the intent that best describes it?,"a. I'd love to get my salary through this method.
b. This is how I plan to obtain my salaries. It's a great way. You can get it through a direct deposit, through direct debit or through an automatic payment. There are many ways to acquire it. That's right!
c. When can I get paid through the direct pay method? You need to sign a contract which says that the employee is willing to be paid in this way in a fixed monthly installment. So, when you sign the contract, you have to say that you will be willing and able to pay your employee salaries in fixed installments of at least four monthly. Once the employment contract is signed, then the fixed payment of the salaries is done in the next 30 days. The contract may be renewed every five years. After five-year, it is reviewed and the payment method is changed. At the time of review, the amount of salary is revised, and at the end of five year, a new contract will also be signed. As per the new employment conditions. If you do not agree with the change, or if you cannot agree, your employees may choose a third party such as a law-firm or a legal practitioner to review the changes. In the best case scenario, there will not be many changes in your employment arrangement. Therefore, this is not something that needs to stress about. To make sure that this process is implemented properly, I will suggest that it should not cost much to implement. For your convenience, we will implement a monthly automatic salary payment using a bank account. We can also use bank wire. Or we can use a credit card. But, that's your choice. A company's salary policy should be reviewed regularly, especially when employees are promoted to higher positions. And if the business growth is good, one should review how much money should pay to the employees."

connotation we put on to such uttering? If we say ""can I get a loan of GbP""
is this same as asking for a ""cheet"" on FB? Why would that be? What's the intention?"
806,Do I Need To Choose Gbp To Get My Salary Deposited Properly?,Considering this utterance: Do I Need To Choose Gbp To Get My Salary Deposited Properly? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I believe this is a rhetorical inquiry. It is asking a question that is more about the questioner’s belief and opinion on the matter at hand rather than an inquiry about a particular fact about Gbps.

For a more formal, academic question, you would probably want at least four questions asked. For example:
1) Describe the difference(s) between gbit and gbps?
2) What exactly is this Gbit rate of data communication? Explain what you are referring to in your answer. Is it a rate at which bits are transferred on a wire, or the number of bits per unit on an optical fiber. Or do you mean the rate that bits move across a network? Or what exactly? Is the bit per second a figure you have just calculated? Does it have an unit of measurement attached? Descript the quantity in a mathematical way, that you‘re using to calculate it, if it is not a simple multiplication (or division).
3) Explain to me how the “g ” is being used in gbits per hour? What does it mean by g“s”? Why is it necessary to include the g? And how are you using the term gb to describe this data rate? That sounds like it should be something different. Perhaps I am just misunderstanding the terms. Are you referring that data is transferred over a circuit at the speed of g bits? If so then how? Are there different types of circuits? For what is g applied in this case? There has been some debate on what that number means over the years, is that what it says? The debate is on over whether g is meant to be the same as the symbol for binary digits of 1s and 0s used to represent the data bits or whether it‟s a different thing. If they are identical, then what would happen if I put a g on every number and I multiply all the numbers together and divide them by 10, and then I add 1? It seems unlikely that would give you a whole number. I am guessing I may be misunderstanding something about g, I don‚t yet know. Would it be better if you explain this to someone with more understanding of computer science, like Wikipedia or your professors? Please explain what g means in terms of units of measure. Also, what"

The answer is yes. You need to make sure that the ""currency"" setting in your payment module is set to the correct value. This is not necessarily the exchange rate - it is also possible (and I think most likely) that your currency is a USD-to-your-native-currency conversion rate and you are using a different currency in the paywall. The ""Currency"" option in Settings > General > Payment will set the value that is used to convert the money from whatever currency the user is receiving to your own currency. If your ""Amount"" field is in GBP, GB is fine. USD is good but you need a good conversion. Also, be aware that some payment providers will actually convert in USD and charge your customers in EUR. Your currency setting needs to be set for the currency type that they will pay. For example, PayPal only charges you in dollars. When you set up the conversion, you will usually get one of two results: (a) the default currency you want to use (which is most common if you don' t care what currency they choose to pay you with) or (b) a currency rate. So, for example PayPal says that for payments they want you to receive in American money (USD), you might want the rate for ""Dollar to Euro"". If you click on the link it will tell you what the USD rate is at the time that it was set."
811,How Do People Send Me Money?,Considering this utterance: How Do People Send Me Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"If you thought it was a direct question, or if you didn’t, consider if it is true that the speaker is not asking a question. He is giving you instructions. If the instructions aren”t clear, then ask how the instruction would be given to someone in your position (the speaker“s) who needs to know how to send an email for business purposes. (I‘m trying to help you become better at what you do. The instructions to “send an e-mail„ are not as clear as they should be.)
‚Ä¶

Consider whether the ‚?Õ is an action verb or the first-person singular of the verb ”??>send money? What are your choices?
(Note: The speaker can either be the payee of a check or a sender, and in either case may be a person, a computer, an automatic teller machine, etc.) ’? The „?Ã¦>payee has to be identified so that someone who is going to receive a payment knows what to expect. ‹??>Sender is just a word that you use to identify someone.

815,How Do I Get My Salary In The Account?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Get My Salary In The Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"How Do You Get A Loan In A Bank.
What is your purpose in uttering, and what is its purpose? What does this mean. It might mean a lot of things to you. And you might not even realize that you are communicating that, unless you take the time to consider these things. Consider these three possibilities for this question. These will cover all of them. If any one of the three are true then you will have to answer the question, “How do you get a loan in a bank?”
A. How do I get my salary in the account? - In this case your intent is to ask how do your pay go into your bank account. In your mind you would expect that the answer is simple. You would think that ‘how do my paycheck go to my account’ is an easy answer. But this is not at all the reason that most people say this. For the most part people will not consider how their paycheck is recorded. So they will tell you the wrong answer to this particular question (or any question). When someone asks ’how to get…‘, the first thing you think about is how they are going to ”get“. That is what you should first consider. This is one way to look at the meaning of these questions. Then we can look closer at this and see what it means. A.1. Getting is a way of doing something. As in ‚I want to go home and get something to eat‛. Here your getting is †doing something‚. There is no question as to where the money is going. ′I just want you to understand the fact that I am paying you and then I want my money back′. The first question is just an assumption of how someone „treats„ him or herself when they ‟get something from someone‟. Now you can think of it this way. Let's look a little closer and consider this in three ways: 1) How the Paycheck of a typical worker is treated in this regard. Most workers do not have a very good view of their pay. They don't usually know what portion of that salary is actually income. Instead they think they have an account balance. Usually they don›t know exactly what their salary and how it is used. Their pay usually goes into"
816,What Are The Ways For Others To Transfer Me Money?,Considering this utterance: What Are The Ways For Others To Transfer Me Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is he trying to get his money out of you, or what? This is a really simple and common way of transferring money between people and it is done by telling your intended recipient how much money you plan on giving them. It is also common to say ""Transferring money is one of the best ways for others to transfer me money"" or something along those lines. Here is just a few examples:

The above paragraph contains an example of how to give and take money with a friend. If two friends were talking about how they were going to spend a day together, you could say: Let me transfer you $20. This can be used to pay for some gas, lunch, etc.
Here is an even better example: You are spending a night with your roommate. Instead of telling her that you will be bringing money, tell her to tell you how many drinks she has planned. She will know exactly how your night will go with you paying for it. Of course, she could also decide to go out to eat or do some other things. Either way you can still tell how you are going spend to cover your half of things and she can say how she will cover the other parts. You can use these examples to your advantage to help your money game. The more information, the better of course. Now, for an actual example, how about a real example from my life? I am in the process of setting up a scholarship for a young man. He is going through an unfortunate set of circumstances, and his situation has made him very down on himself. Because this is my first time setting something like this up, I can't seem to do it right. I have spent two hours on the telephone trying things that did not work. After talking with another friend, we came up with this: How to Transfer Money to Others. Let's say I want to send $500 to this young mans account and help him. When I tell him this, he would look at me confused at first. But after hearing more, it will all come together for him and he will understand how this works. In this example I would want him to agree to my offer of giving him $300. Then I will say that in order to make the transfer I need $200 or $250. We can agree on $150 as the total amount to be transferred. So this means that I plan to bring $"
817,What Different Ways Are There For Someone To Send Me Money?,Considering this utterance: What Different Ways Are There For Someone To Send Me Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"(3.2) This is a request for something.
This is not a question. It is simply a statement of fact, that something is happening or is being asked about. The question mark has no purpose here. There is no doubt as to which thing he is talking about: the money. So this is an assertion not an enquiry (as there can be no answer to 'What Different Types of Money?' that is more than one type of money).
It is also clear that the speaker is asking for money - there could be nothing else in his life. If you were to say the full question, it would be What kinds of different ways can I ask for a loan? (I can only use one of 'for' or 'of' to ask a particular kind of loan, not both)
The question itself is what makes it a 'question' for the purposes of this test, but it is clear from the content that it cannot be answered with more ways than there are different kinds (or types) of monetary loans that one can apply for."
818,What Do I Need To Do To Transfer My Paycheck To My Account?,Considering this utterance: What Do I Need To Do To Transfer My Paycheck To My Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"How should it be used?

The answer to this last question should be the first consideration of any piece of material written. If it can be applied, then it’s good.
A good definition would be: This phrase should answer the question, ‘what?”
If this phrase is written without consideration to its audience or context, a reader will be left with the impression that the writer is trying to say that you cannot do this thing you just did and expect to continue on and have your paycheck go to your bank account. In this case, the reader is being put in a position where you need to explain that there was a mistake made. You did this without understanding it and need clarification. The reader may not be able to do something and you know they can but you have to help them to figure out how to go about this. This could be a good thing, but there need be some thought as to whether the audience is going to know how you were able do it. That is not all that is required here, you also need a conclusion. For example, If I had a question and my audience could answer I would have a better question. Or perhaps the sentence, what to be more effective as a sentence. I‘d rather have this: How to transfer my paycheck to my bank Account. But I need more information about what happens. Maybe this would work better. How do I do that? There is a lot wrong with this sentence but I think the idea is good I just need better wording. Here is where we see a difference as the way we approach and the content that we provide are all related. Our goal is to provide the best and that requires thought and analysis. And we need content to make this thought more clear but this isn“t really a “writing„ it is something much deeper and a bit more philosophical. Writing is just the means to an end but if we don t understand the end we could end up wasting our time, so to speak.‭
This is an example of the importance of understanding the purpose of writing. It isn't just to give a short message about something. When we can‬ make writing work for us and not just against us is  the‚ key to our success‹ . We have‏ to understand‡ how�"
819,How Can My Friend Send Me Money?,Considering this utterance: How Can My Friend Send Me Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The context of the utterances:
I am a friend of a person who is in need of financial assistance. She has asked me to send her a check (as I am her friend and trust her). Now, if I had asked her if she would like to receive a gift of $10 from me, then I'd have a clear intent of giving her money. Now that I think about it, this is what I did ask her - she is my friend so she has to love me for the sake of loving me. So I asked: ""How Can I Send You Money?""
But if the intention was to give money, that would have been ""I will give you a $50.00 Gift Card""
My question is, what is a clearer way to ask this without sounding like I'm being a scammer? It doesn't feel right to me asking: how can I send you money but not feel like a con man.
EDIT: The friend was a little offended I didn't call her first
P.S.: I know this isn't the only way, maybe my way is not the easiest or most natural one. I was just interested in how others would ask the question. And maybe other ways are more ""correct"".
And just to be clear, I understand the difference between a ""gift request"" and a donation. We are in the process of talking about the latter, but if you are wondering what the differences are, here are my observations: 
When it is about a non-profit or organization, the person asking for a money donation usually gives reasons about why she needs the money and how she intends to spend it. That's not a problem, it can go on forever in fact. The donation is done by the donor and the receiving entity is grateful to have the donation and for any future help she can get in future from this entity. (and so on...)
However, when it comes to a personal friend (who is also a good friend) that has financial problems, and you want her to get out of them, a lot of times she will ask you if there is any way she could help you out. But what if this friend doesn’t ask because she doesn;t want to impose and that's why the friend asks you instead of asking the said friend directly? Maybe she also needs more time to think it through."

Can I Transfer a Salary for Another Job?
Let's say that I'm currently working for Company 1 but I want to work for company 2. I am a non-U.S. citizen and would therefore be able to transfer my salary under a visa sponsorship program. The visa sponsor is Company 2 which would allow me to pay for my own immigration costs and provide me with a work visa. This seems to me like a transfer because it takes all the risk from Company1 and then transfers it to Company2. Is this what you think of as a salary transfer? Can anyone answer this for me? What would be an example of salary being transferred? Is it the same as the visa transfer described above? If there are any other examples of salaries being moved, any clarification is appreciated. Thanks for listening and please respond with clarification. :)

It is obvious that a simple answer to this question is not going to be useful in this case. For an answer of this kind would require a lot of time and experience. You can, however, find many other questions on SE that are similar to the question above in some way but are more specific or have received more attention than the above mentioned one. To give you an example of a question that I think can be helpful as an additional example for this one, here are links to questions that might be a helpful addition to your learning about the answer:

823,I Received My Salary In Gbp. How Do I Change This To My Currency?,Considering this utterance: I Received My Salary In Gbp. How Do I Change This To My Currency? What is the intent that best describes it?,"It is very similar to how we are taught in school, or have learned in the past that we should use currency to pay for things. And that currency would be called dollars or Euros or whatever it is, for us in this case, but the point being is that in that sentence, you are speaking about the amount of money you would have received and then you asked the question:
how do I change this to my currency? which is what you just wrote in your question.
You are essentially asking how to do currency conversion, that's all it really means. It's a common mistake that many people make when trying to convert between currencies. The idea behind it comes from being able to exchange cash with someone. For example, in American dollars to Mexican pesos, which you could in theory do, because it's not the same thing as converting US dollars into the Peso, if you went to the money exchange, it was not possible to just exchange US cash in to Mexie Pesos. You could, however, exchange some cash for Mexies, and from there you can take the Mexi cash and exchange it for the equivalent amount in USD. This means you did currency converting, just not for cash (which is a little bit more complicated than just exchanging cash). 
So, basically, what your sentence is saying is this:   I had this amount (of US currency or US$), in US, I converted it to GBP, then I received (GBP), what do i need to change it back to so I can pay in my local currency (Mexie peso or Mexican Pesas), which happens to be Mexican money, with GB, the GB is called the ""Pound"".
Hope this helped clarify things somewhat."
824,How Can My Friend Transfer Money To Me?,Considering this utterance: How Can My Friend Transfer Money To Me? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This is a common question to which there is no exact answer. This article will discuss that with you.

1. Intent of Transfer?
Let’s look at the following statement in isolation:
How do I transfer money to someone else? I want to transfer $2000 to my friend. It is obvious that this question is about transferring money, because money is mentioned in the question – and that‘s what the answer would cover. However, the statement as a whole is different; It asks how to send money. The question therefore needs to be re-written into something like: how do i send $20,000 to a friend? That will then give us some more context on what is being discussed and the context can help in deciding intent. In the first sentence (as it is now written), the person who asks wants to use a service, like PayPal, to make a transfer. They want the money sent to their friend, who will use the service later, on their phone, etc to receive the payment that was made for them. Therefore, we can assume that the sender of the $2,OOO wants the recipient to get the funds. (As a note, it would be wrong though to say that all service providers work like this; they might also just be asking for a direct transfer.)
2. Should the receiver be the one who is paid? If the above is true then yes, obviously the transfer should be paid by the individual being paid. We can”t really say anything to prove the other way, but we do have a little bit of data; the fact that no other person is named as being the party who received the transferred money suggests that both parties, as they were the ones who were paid, were satisfied with the transaction. If you don“t name the payee there will be no money in your bank account. There„s no risk on the part of either person, and it might be more likely to occur (if it ever does at all) when there are multiple people involved. So yes; it should probably be whoever receives the paid is also the beneficiary, in that instance. Of course, that doesn‟t mean it has to, or even would, occur that way in real life. But it‒s not the wrong way to view things.  
3. How Much Money Did I Transfer"
825,Can My Friends Send Me Money?,Considering this utterance: Can My Friends Send Me Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"To be sent, receive money
This is an exchange for a money transfer of some kind.
The sender is expecting money to be received for something that they have done, or are doing. So they are expecting an equivalent exchange. It's a bit like, you're going to give me money; but you don't have it now. You're not just sending me some money for nothing. I expect you to get something in return. In this case the return is money. The expectation that the sender has of the money that is being sent to them. And the fact that a return will be made - this gives us a sense that we are going on a transaction. We are exchanging something. Money can often have this quality in that it can sometimes be used to buy the things we desire, but the quality is much more subtle than that. A lot more on that later. (But for now, money has this sort of quality too.)
In this sentence the subject is a friend, the recipient is you. Your purpose is to receive something and they can expect that you will do so. ""Can my friends send me..."" is what they intend. They would like to have their friends sending them money, that this is something they expect. 
I would have chosen this answer in the sentence, if my answers were ""choosing one of these, can you pick more than one?"":
It sounds like:
They want me to send them something I can get in order to make the trade (exchange) for the sending of something to me (money).
Or in other words, they want you (receiver) to return them (sender) something equivalent, which in this example is (the thing). That something is called the ""equivalence"".
When a thing is used in relation to its exchange equivalence it is said be exchangeable. This is one form of ""meaning"" for ""convert"" and it applies to money here just as much as to any other thing. To convert it's just that, to transfer it from one to something else. Like ""send"" or ""exchang"" in your question. Or ""return"" which is just ""giving money back""."

(I am in the process of buying a home and will be renting it out during my stay out on the road.) The tenant must not have pets and must have a quiet, restful environment.
2. Can a child's teacher have the right to request, for example, that the teacher's car be parked in an acceptable place on school property if the student is taking the car to get something from it at school? I think this is reasonable, as long as the child cannot use this account to drive her parents. I assume that it would work the same way with a bank or a credit union. Does the answer depend on whether the school is private or public? If the private school allows for public access to school grounds, is it acceptable? (For example: would it be acceptable for a teacher at a Catholic school to ask that a student's parent park their car in such a manner that would not interfere with other parents parking their cars?)
3. In this case would the account be used for:
a) A business to store money for payroll, taxes, etc. and not the personal expenses of the business owner. For example if a private business had an account with the name ""Company"" with only that name on it. Would it still be considered the employee's account? For instance, would someone be allowed to write a personal check to cash for cash money to pay off bills at the office? Could an expense account, such as a business credit card, be made available to the person to be charged? or the cash could be handed over to someone who would hand the money over for the company? Or would this violate company policy and cause a problem with taxes? The company would pay the taxes to file its own return (the employee) and only deduct the expenses for tax purposes. This is a different from the case where a client pays an ""expense"" and the ""client"" reimburses the provider. Also the credit/debit card would be in one's name, but would still appear to others as being used by the individual. The person could charge the check (or card) to an individual account but others would see the charges on your check as if you personally went to a store and charged it with your card"

This is an example of a question of the type: ""What does X mean? Is it Y?"" The answer to that question must first be answered by asking, ""Who wants to understand X and the answer is Y? The intent is usually to ask the question.
If you look closely at the word ""currency"", the ""who"" is probably asking about the US Dollar, the only form of US dollar circulating today. If you ask about a different currency, then the first thing to consider is how to convert from this currency to the one you intend to use. You must answer the following questions: 1. ""How do you get this kind of money? 2. How often do banks exchange it for US dollars? 3. Will you be able to exchange other forms of currency (or foreign currency) into US currency at some point? 4. Are other countries willing to have their currency exchanged into it, as well? This can get complex. It's not that hard to figure out if you do any foreign travel at all and keep track of what the exchange rates are. This is a bit of an oversimplified model, but it's good for a start. The important point is that you will need to do some research beforehand."

What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it an indirect question (Do you know if this is allowed for my salary?) or a direct question with a rhetorical implication (I think this can be used for your salary)?

This is a great example to discuss what is and is not ""rhetorical"" and how to identify and correct it.
In the example, the rhetorical question is ""Do You know If this [the statement] can [can be] used [used, is used to get the point across.] for [your] salary?""
Rhetoric is generally used, but the speaker can have his/her specific intention for using them. This can also be done in conversation or with body language. Here are some examples:
""What kind of work do you do?"" -> ""I am a teacher.""
(slight smile, raise eyebrows) -> I was asking because I thought this was good for conversation. But I think you can use these kind (informal) questions in any situation. (This was an example of what you could say if you use rhetorical questions for bodylanguage)
Here are a few other questions (as of this answer) to give you examples of rhetoricals
What are the main differences between a question and a statement?
Can I say ""What do I do here?"" instead of ""How do people do the work around here?"". (this is rhetorical) (but if the person says ""how do we do this work"" it would be the correct answer.)
Is this a good way to say, ""Please do me a favor""? (it makes it sound like something for you to do, when it isn't.) (rhy)"

“The only thing you can’t be too early to be, is too late”

It‘s funny how you don‟t realize how late you are to the party (or the job interview, or the date, etc.) until you get there.
I think people sometimes miss opportunities, and in some circumstances, they miss the chance at the opportunity. There‚s never a lack of something you just haven‍'‍t yet tried. But, once you try it, you‛re too (late).

834,Can I Transfer My Salary If It'S In A Different Currency?,Considering this utterance: Can I Transfer My Salary If It'S In A Different Currency? What is the intent that best describes it?,"To me, as a native English speaker, my first guess is to say the person was asking 'if their salary could be paid in a different currency' which would be to ask if it can be exchanged.

But if you ask a translator if a foreign sentence can translate to English they might say 'what would you mean if I paid my salary in dollars?' I have never heard that question before, but it would seem, to me as an English-speaking English teacher, that 'pay' and 'currency' are synonyms in this case. But I'm not saying that the question means that and I haven't come across such a case yet. Maybe this question is more about what can I use to pay my wages or my rent? So let's focus on that!


I'm also not clear on what the 'different currency', 'in' or 'for' means in the sentence above:
'Can I transfer my Salary for it's in different Currency?' 
What I would expect is 'Can/May I exchange my pay to another currency? Or if my job was paid by someone in Euros, could I get a job that paid me in Dollars?"
835,Can I Get Paid In A Different Currency?,Considering this utterance: Can I Get Paid In A Different Currency? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it to make a statement on the current exchange rate or the exchange rates in general? Or are you just interested in knowing whether the speaker can or can’t pay you with different currencies?

If you were to ask “Can I get PAID in a different currency?,” you would likely be met with the following response: ‘Yes, but we don‘t accept your currency.“
However, if you rephrased the question and said, ”Can someone get paid or paid with a currency that is currently not accepted by my business?„ you might very well receive a more favorable ’answers‛.
Here‚s why:
Let‟s say that I work as a consultant and I charge my clients a flat fee for my services, let‡s call it one thousand dollars. If my client is from Germany and wants to pay the entire amount in Deutsch Marks (DM) I‖I can certainly accept her offer as she has a DM account and can transfer the amount to my US account. However, I need to do this at the bank and incur transaction fees and there‒and I would have to wait to cash my DM for at my local bank. All of this can be done online, and with very little risk and no fees or exchange. I can accept the offer and the money is received very soon. The client and my bank are both happy. This would be my first choice. My second choice would to exchange all USD for DM and have both the client, my company›s bank, the IRS and all others involved with exchange and transaction charges. In this case, not only do I incur the fees of the conversion, there is also risk of fraud. It is a bit more complicated. Let us imagine that the DM exchange is very slow. Now both parties are not happy with this transaction. They are stuck and waiting for a conversion. At some point they decide not to complete this conversion but instead continue to use USD and go about their business. So, in this scenario the transaction between the two parties has been completed but I have not been paid in DM. There is no way to force the other party in the contract to fulfill their portion in USD. No one was willing to go through the process, they just chose not too, despite the risks and expense.

836,Why Didn'T My Transfer Go Through?,Considering this utterance: Why Didn'T My Transfer Go Through? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The utterances were collected in a sample. The first one, Why Did My Letter Go Astray?, was collected from a person who sent a letter to her brother; the second, why didn' t my transfer go through?, is from an inmate who wished that his transfer had gone through. He wanted the guard to know that he was interested in the transfer; he had been told, however, that it will be a lengthy process.

I found out that my letter was astray because it was not delivered to my brother. My transfer has not gone well because I am not transferred yet, even if we all want that. There could be many possible answers to the first uttering; a possible answer might be that someone did not write to inform the addressee that she had sent the letter. A possible analysis could include the fact that the person has been waiting for a response from her relative for some time. Perhaps the brother has forgotten the matter and it is not a priority for her. Or is she waiting to give the necessary response before sending another letter? Another alternative is that there was a problem with the way the postal service was working; in this case it might not be because of the recipient but the mailman who has failed to deliver the letters. However, the speaker said that all other people's messages were delivered; perhaps the problem is her own. Another analysis might include how important the message itself is. It might seem to be less important and she forgot to remind the receiver that her letter is pending. Alternatively it could imply that other letters, important to a recipient, have been sent, and now the sender wants him to remember also this letter, so the reason why the other ones did get to him was because the important messages took precedence over the trivial one. This last interpretation is similar to that of why my father didn’t die: my aunt was the primary recipient of his messages, not knowing that this is exactly his intention. In sum, we might understand the utterings as:
1. Why didn't my mail get delivered?
2. I don't know why, but my letters did come in."

What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is the speaker trying to deceive the listener as to the true intent of this sentence?
Are there other sentences with the same pattern and which describe similar intentions? I am trying hard to find a general pattern for this kind of utterances.

A:
It's an example of a passive construction used for the purpose of rhetorical question. In general, when you want the rhetorical effect of making a question out of an argument, you make it passive. It is an ""I"" construction (I am..., I could...), but it's not really about ""me"", it is about something that would happen if something was true. The reason that ""if I were true"" would not work is that you are saying it, not the thing that is supposed to happen. If I was, or could have, the effect you describe,...
Here are some ""passive"" constructions with rhetorical questions. They make questions about what is being described instead of the people who are being told. These are not exactly rhetorical, just some things you might say. Some are passive in more than one way (e.g., they are about the things that happen, instead about you), some in one direction and some other way. All of these can be translated as rhetorical (or not) in different contexts. 
""If I have one, then I won't need to have two.""

If you say the passive as is, it can still make a rhetorical point without being rhetorical. (If there is some thing you have in common with someone, but you do not, so that it would be good to know that...)
Passive: The man was born with all of his limbs except for one; so he was never able to use it. He was always in pain as a result, and his life was ruined as he grew up. So I ask you, can I use this limb if I take care, use proper therapy, make my body strong, exercise it properly, etc.?

A:
[1]
The speaker is asking whether they can add another currency unit to their account balance.
As a native Australian English speaker, I would say that it is ambiguous.  My first interpretation was that the speaker wants to add more funds to the existing balance, and was wondering if it was feasible. However, this interpretation only seems to hold if they have a negative balance in the account. If they were in credit, or had positive balance (e.g., an overdraft), it doesn't make sense to say this. In such a case, the only way you're going to have negative funds in an account is if you withdraw from another place."
842,How Do I Go Forth On Transferring Money Into My Account?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Go Forth On Transferring Money Into My Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This utterances can be one of three options, or some combination thereof:
1. How do I go forth on this transfer of funds to pay my bills? (This is probably the most common one as it usually implies a transfer from one account to another account.)
2. When do you transfer money into one's account? What do the two accounts represent? For example, is it from the account of a business to the personal account, a loan from an account (such as a checking or savings account) to a personal checking account or vice versa (a savings/checking account from a family member to you), an investment from either checking/savings to your investment portfolio, etc. or a combination or multiple of these? 
3. Why do we transfer and withdraw funds from personal accounts to other accounts? Is to save for the future or use in a different way? Or is there a particular account such as for a vacation? To do something else such an a purchase? How should it be explained to one who has questions? I have always explained that it is a means of saving for one future use or activity, but how should one explain this to others? In addition to these, how is this done by others such that they would understand the same or similar concept? Thanks in advance.

This is something that I am still trying to understand. I have always just paid by the minute. Then I started paying for my mobile phone with my credit card and the same thing happened there. It is a nightmare trying so hard to explain what it is and why you have to pay when something goes wrong.
My mum just uses her phone for free and it's fine if you buy something when you don't have enough money. The minute you do, the mobile company can charge you whatever they like. In that sense you could say the companies are being mean, but in what way? I pay £30 every month and I'd pay even more if I lived in Europe so why is it such a big issue? How is this a problem when I was in England for 6 years and never had a bill like this in my life so I never experienced it as a 'problem'.
If you want the phone, pay the bill and stop asking for a refund. If it goes up too high, then buy another phone. How hard can that be? Why do companies like to put people like me into this position where I can't even use the free service. They make people pay for it and then charge them for the service which they have already paid for. All my phone contract and usage is over £500 a year. But why can someone like Mum have free usage? The companies do not make the best service, they are the problem. We need to change the way things are done for everyone. People should start being aware of what they actually do so it doesn't keep happening. Why should people be punished for their actions? What are you really doing to us? We are all being manipulated. Please explain the process in a more detailed way so we can understand it. Thank you from a new user."

4. Wait for it to be processed. (this is taking around 1-2 weeks. depending upon the time of day, day of week, time zone, etc.)...

What is the intent that best describes it?,"A. It's a statement. B. An uttering of thoughts. C. A declaration of intent. D. None of the above.
The correct answer is 'A.'
Question 2:
In the following passage, what is meant by the expression 'I can't tell what my intent is'?
""There was a time I knew what that was.""
Your Answer
(a) An expression of inability, (b) A statement of fact,
and (c) None that are correct. Correct answer: 'a'
If you were to take a guess on this passage without knowing the answers, you might say: The expression: ""There's been something on my mind that I can not tell you."" This would be an accurate description. (An 'inability' to say something.)
What does this question try to get you to notice by using this kind of phrasing. First of all, it tries to make you notice that there has been some 'unusual' kind (of) thinking going on. In the example given, one may conclude that the thinking was 'anxious' or 'fearful.' In this case, the author wanted you, or the reader, to realize that she has had the thoughts, and she wants someone to know what those thoughts are. This is not unlike the first example in the reading above, wherein the writer wanted the readers to understand that they were anxious, but did not want them to hear about their anxiety. Therefore, they gave you an example where someone would tell someone else about it (the 'thought'.
I guess that this is also the case in 'The other morning I was in a rush to leave. Then I noticed that my keys were in my car. I did'nt know where I put them. And it took almost two hours to find them...' etc. etc.) There are many types of thinking and thinking that is difficult to explain, so this example tries a little to convey this idea, i.e. to draw your attention to the 'difficulty' of some kind or mode of thought. But it also gives you some insight of that kind. The example also tells you that some other thought was on the narrator's mind... but that's another story.

848,Can I Add Funds To The Card Directly From My Bank Account?,Considering this utterance: Can I Add Funds To The Card Directly From My Bank Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"If you had to, could you use the same utterances with different meaning? How different could they be? What can we learn from the differences?

How about this: How Much Can We Add to the Card From The Bank? (I would say, ""To the card""? But the example is not clear. I would guess that you mean: ""Directly from your bank account""? I'm not sure if your example was meant to illustrate a problem or to make a recommendation.)
This is a great opportunity to think in terms of:
Problem
Possible Solution
What does that change in your mind about the problem? Why? Could another solution be better? Does this example make you think differently about that problem so that it seems easier? Can you imagine an extension of this solution where it solves some problems that this one does not? Do you see it as being related to a larger issue or concern? Is there a difference between a ""problem"" and a set of ""concerns""? What do you do with the set/bundles of concerns? Are some more useful than others? When you have a concern, what do people do about it that makes it less of a worry? Or more of one? In other words, if you want to change an issue, where does it fall in a list of the concerns about a subject? This is just a simple example, but these questions are important to ask and to help us understand the subject.
A great way to do this is to have someone you trust to interview for an entire day. They can ask about your concerns. You can explain them to them and they can write out their concerns that way. Then, they are asking different questions and you can look at it this way: What's the biggest problem right now? The one that seems most urgent? One that has more impact on the quality of life? Then see if these other examples make them more or less important. In short, how are the ""real"" things that they worry about related? It is much more difficult to deal with one concern at a time than 10-20 or more at once (see the book, Worry About the Worries!). This will help you get your brain thinking about different ways of handling the concern. It helps you become more flexible. But it really needs to be done in conversation. If I am sitting in"

What is the intent that best describes it?,"I was asked to give a summary of the above-mentioned utterances. The following are my findings, and it's my opinion that the best answer is A.
This utteranced by the person is very general, not only is their intention not clear, but they also don't have an intent in place. This means that if a conversation is to happen in order for anything to become clear about money or the transfer, it would require a very large amount of work in terms of a lot of time, effort, money, energy to make sure that a dialogue is set up to begin. That is why I am listing this as not being in the form or category of an utterence. Also, I have never been asked about my intention for such an activity, so therefore it is not possible to say what intent I was using while doing it. If, however, you look at the word ""work"", it appears that it was used to mean to do, which is what the question is asking. As for ""into"", you have to think of what it means to have a balance in your account or what is meant to be transferred. 
The following is an example of one of many possible interpretations that could be taken from such a word:
Into the account of someone, to put something into their account."

Please Help What is the intent that best describes it?,"What does this statement mean to you? How would you feel if it were used this way?

It’s important to know the right way to transfer money into or out of your bank so that you can manage your money as best as possible. The money transfer is a common transaction for all of us but when this becomes very complicated it‘s time to seek professional help.
For example, when transferring money to a foreign country, you might need to find a bank in that country that will accept the deposit. In most cases, money-transfer centers have the largest network of international banks with which they can perform the transfers. If the money needs to be converted into local currency, the institution might charge a fee for that. This is not always the case, but you should investigate any potential conversion charges. You may have to convert the amount you send to foreign currency first before depositing it into your local bank. For more information on how to do that, consult with an expert for advice. Transferring money from abroad can be a little more complex, especially if you want to send a large amount. There may be currency conversion fees, bank charges and transfer fees depending on the transfer size and which bank is involved. It also might depend on where you are located and whether or not international bank regulations apply to your transaction."
851,I Would Like To Transfer Some Money From My Other Bank Account Into This One.,Considering this utterance: I Would Like To Transfer Some Money From My Other Bank Account Into This One. What is the intent that best describes it?,"1) To give an example..
2)  To transfer some money (money) out of one (account) and into another(account).
3) I don't understand the structure of the sentence.. How do you make sense of it as an English speaker?

A:
The main verb I would use for the second question would be 'transfer'. The main verbs in English can be used to express the three main types of verbs: 'To do', 'to be', and 'have'.  You are asking what is it that the speaker 'intends' to do with the verb, in this case 'Would like'.
In a general sense, 'would like' is a non-committal verb.  It expresses a feeling. It is not necessarily something specific. For instance, we say, ""I would like to have coffee"" even though there is nothing specific that I want to drink at that time.
'Would have' can have two main meanings. The first is that a person would have something, even if they never had it actually. In 'I am going to my office.' I have gone. I will not go back. This has the same form as 'will have'. We don’t say 'you will never have...'. 'If I had some wine, I‘d pour myself a cup.” 'He didn't have a lot of money; he“would have spent a few dollars. There is some disagreement among grammarians regarding the meaning of this use of have and if it is actually grammatically correct - as a rule we don'
t correct grammar. However, it's common and it does mean the person has had something in another time in the past. As a matter of fact, this is how we express it if we use a past tense like 'had': 'When I got to the store,I bought myself some bread. When I went on line, my credit card was declined.'
We also can say that something will happen in a particular time if the subject of 'when' or 'if' has a future tense. 'What is he going do? When the time comes, he will go on his vacation or if/when you pay him,he will give you a refund. If he does not do any of these things, you will be angry"

B: I need to make sure that my account is fully topped up. C: Top up is not in my vocabulary. D: To top it is to be topped off. E: When the next bill is due, I will top my cards up by a certain percentage. F: This sentence means top the card up, meaning top, so that is all it means. How can you tell which one it should be: A, B, D or F?
The correct answer is choice (D). Although choice A has a similar meaning to “to top off”, choice D provides the most accurate definition: ”to fill up“. Topping off is a term for filling up your water supply. If you want to use the term to describe topping up a phone account, then the correct response is (F). The correct sentence should have been phrased as, ‘When the last bill was due and the bill before that was also due…’

A. The word ’to‘ is used to link verbs, adjectives and adverbs with their complements. (to do – do, does – does, done – done, did – did) A good way to remember is this: you can have a to, a do or a done in a sentence. But you don‚ÑÝt need a don, du or don to have an action happen.

859,How Can I Transfer Money From An Outside Bank?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Transfer Money From An Outside Bank? What is the intent that best describes it?,"1 Answer
There are a number of ways to transfer money from your bank to another. If you are using your own bank, there is often no fee on transfers up to around $250. Some banks, for example, may impose fees on all but the smallest transfers.
2. To transfer your funds from one account to an account belonging to a different owner, the sender must have the permission of the account owner to do this. This permission may be obtained in a variety of different ways, such as a written document, electronically or verbally. Once the ownership transfer is complete, a notification will be sent to both accounts. The account which sent the money will see its balance change at the time of notification and the recipient account will have a new balance at this time as well. You may have received this notification by mail or it may appear in your account statement.3. There are many different types of foreign currency that can be exchanged. These include foreign currencies, travelers cheques, precious metal bullion, and currency exchange (forex). There may not be any transaction fees associated with an exchange, though the costs could be different for each country. In the US, this is a simple process. However, you may also have to pay a flat fee for the forex company, in addition to the exchange rate.4. An exchange involves buying and selling the foreign money for US dollars. When it is done on a large scale there are transaction costs, because large transactions tend to involve brokers who charge fees.5. A money transfer involves transferring the currency to your friend, while a wire transfer simply transfers the funds to them. Money transfers usually charge higher fees, however, depending on the bank they are often much faster than a regular money order or transfer.6. Foreign exchange companies will often charge a fee to facilitate the transfer between countries. Many foreign exchange banks will charge between $25 and 30 dollars for any transfer that exceeds $100. Sometimes the fee can even be charged for a transaction that falls below that amount.7. All transfers are subject to federal and state reporting, regulatory, compliance and other requirements by both the sending and receiving account(s).8. Both the receiving and sending account holders must authorize a transfer in advance. Generally speaking a letter written by the beneficiary is enough to allow the transferee to make an immediate transfer, but some countries do allow a verbal authorization to be taken as"

To get answers, I can try to think about the possible answers. I am considering the answer that seems logical. After reviewing various options, a few make sense:

In the same way that I used the context of ""What methods do you use?"" to find the method to use, so I will use the following context ""To change what methods I need I should first understand how adding works, how changing how money works and how to make my spending change.""
Here are some methods that might be relevant to how I change how my spend how much money: a. Adding Money. b. Changing The Money In My Hand. Or c. Increasing The Rate Of My Savings. d. Decreasing How Much The Income Of Others Is. These might not be very useful because they might seem too simple. The first method seems unlikely to be useful. If I add more money, it will be gone. How can it be helpful to learn the concept of more and less money when it is so easy to spend all of my extra money quickly? This method might help change my way of spending money but it doesn't seem that helpful since spending it all is easy. But if I learned the methods of increasing how quickly savings change and changing it with a goal in mind, this might also be good. My savings are increasing slowly, and my savings is increasing in a way I like. It seems that learning how savings increases would also help. However, even with this information on"

I think I know what you are looking for, and if we could find a way that is not too inconvenient, we might be able to help you.
Can you tell us anything about your situation? Is there anything special that needs to be done? Any security or other issues? Do you need to sign up for a new payment method? etc. (I need a few more details so that I can give you a good answer)

We will be happy to assist you with this request. We can't tell you how it will work or what features it may include; that will depend on your account. But this is pretty straightforward. You would need:
1. Have your banking institution send a ""Direct Debit"" to us on a recurring basis (we would use your regular checking or savings account). You can do it online, it's as easy as a direct debit order. The amount that you pay us would be $25 (the fee is $4.95) every time. And you would set it up to pay $100 per month or whatever amount you choose. It is easy to do. In your online banking you should have an ""Account"" section and you will find that we have set up a DeBit order that comes directly from your bank account to our bank. Click on Account and then DeBill to find the Direct DeBank order we created for this account (you must set this up yourself) and add us as the ""Payee"" for $50 or $5K per payment period. Or you can just do the order online. Then you have one payment to the bank and we can use the money however we like. To make the monthly payment, you could go into the online Banking System and pay directly for yourself (as if it is a normal check, there's a Pay tab) or you might need an account manager to go through the process for you, or a phone call for that type of payment. That can be arranged. Our bank does not have to see what we do with your funds, if that's what worries you (they do have a record of all the transactions on their system that come from that Direct Bank Account to them). Or, our account can make regular direct debits out to another"
863,How Can I Perform A Dual Money Transferring From One Account To Another?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Perform A Dual Money Transferring From One Account To Another? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The word 'performing' in this context has the same meaning as it has in the following:
'To carry out (a task) by a specified means or with a prescribed method.'
To use the method specified in such an instance would mean carrying out the task with the aid of money transfers - as the article has pointed out, there are numerous means of performing such a task.
One can use a bank transfer, wire transfer or online transfer.  
I'd suggest:  How can I perform a dual money transferring from one [bank] account to another?  [I think bank accounts are singular rather than plural as in 'one bank']
If you are asking about two bank transfers from two different banks, then one might say: I am looking for a way to perform two separate bank wire transfers. I can't think of a good expression for this scenario."
864,Can You Explain How To Transfer Money Into My  Account For Me?,Considering this utterance: Can You Explain How To Transfer Money Into My  Account For Me? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The best way to figure out intent for a question or utterances is to ask it!

“Can You Help Me with an Email?”
What I want is a list of what my customers are saying about my services.’
The best thing about the question is that the client is actually willing to tell you what‘s wrong with the email, and the customer is telling the agent what they don‚Äôt want! They don't want to lose their money, after all, so they will tell the operator what to avoid.
If the problem is not addressed, the person may simply leave the call or go to another business. This is called ""the no option factor""!
Here's an example:
I have a client who calls every week to change the password. He has an account that he wants set up, he tells the CSR he's calling from a different country, because he does not get good phone service, (he's actually in New Zealand and his call isn't connected to a local operator), he has to pay a fee to call a ""local operator"".
We get the account set-up and all is good, for the next six months. The client calls with another password request! This pattern has continued for years, as the same CSRs handle his calls. Now he calls and says the first thing the phone asks is for his new password, which he doesn't know, nor did we instruct the ""CSR"" to do that. They simply asked for it. It's a very high turnover rate of customers. Many customers will change their password when they are asked and then call us to have it changed again. I've seen it over and over again - the no-opt option! If the request is ignored, they go on to the second best option which is calling to see if they can get his password to be reset, or simply not renew their service. We need to address this issue, this is why this question works so well to get this information for us! (The question has a follow up that can confirm the issue: If he called, was told his information, but they could not help him, how did you manage to solve the situation?)
This is an excellent question for this purpose! It shows you the right questions to look for, it shows that we are really getting"

Q) A. If you have been using the Bank Transfer feature in the past, you know how to use your account number for the transaction. You just type in that number when prompted and send your funds electronically. B. But sometimes it can take a few more steps to get the money sent. To start, click on the ‘Transfer Money’ button on your My Banking page. On the next page that appears, select “Sending and Receiving Account Funds Transfer” and proceed as usual. C) To transfer your money from an account, go to your bank or credit union‘s website and click the button to start a transfer. This button has a different icon than the other buttons on this page—it‟s the one that resembles a check. D) It takes only 5 minutes to process a transaction and it is easy to track your transfer online. For all transfers, keep in mind the following when making any transfer: • Make sure you are sending the amount to the correct recipient and that there are sufficient funds in your checking or savings account. • Remember that if your transaction includes a foreign transaction fee (this fee is a percentage of any money you transfer out of the country), you may be subject to a minimum charge. E) If the person receiving your payment is already enrolled in Direct Deposit, make sure that the information you give matches the account holder‡s name and bank. And if you‚re mailing or dropping off the payment, note the recipient‛s address and the envelope or container in which it„s in. Direct deposit addresses are usually printed on invoices and/or receipts. Make copies of those receipts and mail them with your check so you can track the payments. F) Once the transfer is complete, log into your online account and check on its status to make your first direct deposit. G) This is another way to avoid sending your paycheck directly to someone and incurring additional fees. H) Some banks allow you to transfer funds between an individual bank account (like a personal savings or checking) and an IRA savings, money market mutual fund account to set aside money for short term emergencies. Just select IRA or money-market account on a bank“s online bank statement. Then follow the steps for sending"
868,How Do I Do An International Transfer?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Do An International Transfer? What is the intent that best describes it?,"It is not about the process of getting a bank account or the currency conversion, but about how to do an international transfer. The phrase is an example of the use of a present perfect continuous tense to emphasize the continuing nature of doing an ""international money transfer.""
This phrase has a clear focus, and is often used to describe the act of completing a task. It implies that the transfer is complete and done. There is a general feeling of ""It's done!""
Note: In other cases of transferring money, it is usually ""I"" or ""we"" who do it. For example, ""We are sending our new money to you"". This phrase may be confusing. ""How do I"" implies the action is being done by ""you"".
As you can see from the image, I would use the past tense.
For your sentence:
How Do You Do International Transfers? is wrong:  It sounds like you're trying to ask ""what does it mean to transfer international money?""
Using present continuous with international is correct: It's the same as above. 
""How are you doing international transfers?"" or
You can also say ""What is your international business?"" and then describe what you have done, what challenges you've faced and what solutions you found."

For a more advanced solution, we recommend TransferWise, an online platform that lets you transfer money to people and businesses you'd like to pay with ease. All you need is your Transferwise login information, which you can easily find when you go to the website. Transferring money is a breeze, as you only need an e-mail address of the recipient, so there is never a need or risk of a third-party snooping on your private transaction. And you don't have to provide a reason why you want to transfer — that's the beauty of online money transfer. In just 5 minutes, your money can be on the other person's card. It's that easy. Learn more about using Transfer to move money from a savings account to a checking account with free, no-credit-check transfers. There are no fees or any other strings attached.

To learn more, head over to our article on how to link a bank account from Transfer and how it may help make your life as an entrepreneur easier, or keep an eye out for it on our blog section. Another alternative is Zelle, a new mobile platform for transferring funds in two taps. With this method, the sender will choose the receiver, while the receiving funds stay in a Zellle wallet. Once the funds are transferred between the two Zellen accounts of people, businesses and other companies, Zello will convert the transferred funds to U.S. dollars. You also have the option of converting those Zillions to any currency you desire, including Euros and Pounds. This method is convenient, since you have no need of going through a credit check or having to wait for a direct transfer to complete. Here's a quick overview: Once this is done, it will automatically charge your debit card, provided it is authorized for such purchases. For example, if you use your card for any online purchase, this will happen. If your credit card is not linked yet, don’t worry. When you are ready to purchase online"

say: 'would you like...?' would be closer than what you describe. As
to: it has already been in the other bank... you might as well use
this 'bank transfer' as a convenience to get it in and out of your new

873,I Want To Use Bank Transfer For Topping Up My Account. How Is It Handled?,Considering this utterance: I Want To Use Bank Transfer For Topping Up My Account. How Is It Handled? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The most common answer to this question is 'I want to do something'. In fact the sentence I want is a little bit different, and its function is not to make a request, but to state a condition.
So let's try to answer the question: What's the best form of the conditional: 'if...'? or 'when...'? We'll start from these words...

When. The word when comes after the main verb, so we can say... I need a house when I have money. When I do not have any money, I cannot have a car. But I can have it if I find money... 'When it rains, there is lightning.'. We use the when to give conditions which will happen in the future. 'What do you want for your birthday?', 'what do I tell him'... the list goes on. It is used when the condition cannot be stated at the end of a sentence, as in: You cannot go out unless you have clothes on your back. If you do, they will fall off. In this case, the conditions have to be at least implied. So to use it, you must add a 'then'.
If. This is more commonly used to express a result of actions, not a situation. Let's take a simple example: He has money or not. You can use 'If he has no money', or say 'He has if he is able to take care of himself.' The if can be used with any of these verbs. For instance: If he works hard, he will be able then to manage his family. He will have no more money but he could then use his savings, or his credit... The difference is that 'he will' is an action that will result in a certain effect, while 'has' indicates a state of being, it can occur both ways, even if the action will not always follow. To use them, one can add 'or', with the first example, 'Or he's not able or' or with 'his...', like 'His job is or...'. The first is common in sentences such as: When it's raining, then there will definitely be lightning. (This can also be written as 'There will/Is lightning when it is raining...'). It's used only when 'have money' occurs with"

There is no main subject. The main point is to convey some information to the reader regarding the status of your account.
You can do this by using the present tense with the check verb:
I checked my Account today,and it said I was out of money. 
Alternatively, you can use the progressive tense and express it as a continuous action:   I check my Accounts every Friday, just in case there are any charges that have to be applied, or I get the balance of the Account. It is also possible to have a simple tense, with no time indicators such as yesterday, but that is generally not used as often."

b) Transfering
c) Transfer To
d) Get Money Transferred To Account.

876,Is It Possible To Give A Second Card For This Account To My Daughter?,Considering this utterance: Is It Possible To Give A Second Card For This Account To My Daughter? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it possible to describe this intent in a natural English sentence or can it only be described in the language of mathematics? Or does it mean anything in particular?

The intent of this statement is to give your daughter the card. In this example, intent is an abstraction that we can define in terms of the context. If we don't know the situation, the meaning of intent can be defined as a collection of contexts where that intent makes sense.
For example:
If the speaker knows what will happen (they have knowledge of past and future events),
""I know that I will be giving my daughter her gift. I'm going to the mall today at noon.""
On the other hand, if the knowledge is hypothetical (it is uncertain or not known):
I'm guessing/assuming I might be going there this afternoon. Perhaps tomorrow? ""I might go later. It's a possibility. We'll see how things turn out. ""
In other words, in order to communicate the truth of a context in natural language it's necessary to know and convey the contexts in which that event is valid. This can happen either explicitly (when we describe the events of history), or implicitly (the events we observe are usually defined by their context), the way we talk about weather, time, events, and so on. The context can sometimes come out as something like, ""What's the weather like this fall?""
Intent can also be used to explain what something is. For example to say, what the thing you're describing is: ""This is a table."" If I say ""It's my bed"", the ""table"" part means the same thing - it is what it means to be in this context: it functions as the description of what I meant by ""the bed"".
When we say someone has an intent, we are making a statement about the state of being, not about what they're actually doing. Intent is about meaning. And if someone says, for example ""My intention is not to hit on him"",
this is telling you about their being - they are a certain way, they have that state. You could ask,
and then you might get an answer of ""No"" or ""Yes"", or maybe even an explanation of
the reason behind their words. Maybe they mean that, or it could simply be the result of saying"

What is the intent that best describes it?,"And What If My Answer Is ""no"" Can You Tell Me Why Not? (If the answer is No).

Well first it really depends on the card and the issuer, I'm not an expert on this.
But generally the only people authorized to use the code are the ones who used it to get it. You don't have to give them their account login. It's their card that was on file so if that is not linked to the account you could easily see it as a duplicate or someone trying to steal the login info. If I had to guess, it's not a good thing. And it could be a risk of being charged as per the rules. I could see this one being ok though."

The intent of the uttering is to purchase gas (or other) products.
It is a command for purchase. The intention is not to ""top up"" the existing balance. 
In fact this is an utterant that I would not expect to have a balance to top up. I'd expect the person that says this to be short of gas or other goods to make up for it, not increase the balance!
I can think of a number of ways you can top of an existing quantity, but not a way to increase a quantity:

What is the intent that best describes it?,"You would answer something along the lines of the first three examples. These are good because they help us to understand how to interpret “Can I do that…” in other situations.

Example 1: I need to pay my phone bill and a cheque is not a form of payment that is accepted by Paypal for this purpose. Therefore it is inappropriate to use a Chequebook to Top-Up an account. The question that arises from such an utterances: how do we understand Can you Top up with a Cashier / Cheques / Card / Money Order …?
Answer:
This means that you cannot pay your phone bills with Cheqeekes or Cashiers. If you are planning on using such methods of payments, the best advice would be to call Pay pal and inquire on the payment methods they accept and choose the one that fits. For instance, you can call on this number in your Country and ask them. I suggest you do a google search on ‘Paypal phone number’ and use the numbers listed by a local. (This is a suggestion and not the right way to deal with this)
In a scenario such as your own, one must be very careful when dealing with cheqes as we are using money orders, it comes at a high cost. You need an experienced accountant that will guide you on what to do. This is because the cheques you receive are not negotiable and must therefore be cashed. However, there are some cheques you could cash at your bank or your local post office (which is often better and cheaper than a bank). For example, I have a friend who uses the postal system to cashing cheqs and the process is simple but expensive. But if you want to find out if an amount is negable (or negoitable) by looking it up here: What Is A Negoible Amount?
The same rule applies to checks. It would not be negosible. So your options are to either call the Pay Pal number and pay the bill with credit card or use your Pay Per month plan, that comes with your card (not prepaid but post-paid) and have it charged and paid online. As an additional tip, do not use this card for other purchases and you will not incur any transaction fees. Also you need a PayPal account to get charged on your credit"
883,Is It Possible To Top Up With Cash? If So How Do I Do It?,Considering this utterance: Is It Possible To Top Up With Cash? If So How Do I Do It? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This question can be applied to many conversations you've had, in person or over the phone, and many more that might be going on in your mind.

This topic will have you wondering what is possible for us, as well as how we do it. In fact, you may find yourself feeling overwhelmed, or perhaps not knowing where to begin. That is why our next step will be to start with the beginning; the basis of this process. This will make it easier to understand, because if we have a solid foundation in place, then we can build on that knowledge and start doing the best we possibly can. Our goal is to learn all that we need to in order to be successful. The following points will serve as a foundation for all the rest: The Basics. We will begin with what we know and then gradually progress to what else we will need. For the time being, we'll take all those things you already know to make our lives and our businesses better by using them again. Let's begin: 1. A Word on Money. Is it Possible to Top-Up With Money? Let me start this by saying that money comes and goes. Some money is easier than other money, which is not money at all. It's a concept of time based on how you define'money'. You can't top-up with time. You may have heard of 'time debt'. It is a fancy name for something that is very much needed: more time for yourself. But, I'll bet that if you are reading this article, it is because you have realized that your current time debt is too high. Most of us have experienced this, but it may sound like just one more problem in a big list of problems. I hope to explain that, although money may not be in abundance, there is another kind of abundance: time, energy, information and love. They are not the same as money. There are other forms of money besides the one that you use daily. One is 'currency', that's the legal tender or coin of a country. Other forms are 'credit', 'debt', and 'investment'. What all of these have in common is that they are time in form. Time and Money, A Match Made in Heaven. As with most things, money plays a huge role in business. Sometimes we think that it's only the big"

A desire to eat a hamburger
An intention to take a bus
To call a friend
This sentence is: What would we say? If we are to understand each other in our language, we must first know this sentence to make sense of one another. Let’s see how to write one out.
I am going to a movie with my mom, my brother and dad. I will leave home on Friday. Can you guess the verb that we would put in this position of the sentence? It is a good guess that: Go with a. The correct word we have guessed is ‘Go with‘. That means I am “going” to my destination, ”with“ my family ‐ that is, I have planned for them to join me „at‟ my movie house. It means we ‚have‚ planned to go together, but ’I‛ am the one who is responsible for doing things, and the family is helping me. This is what this verb means!
Next, this word: is. Now we will say how we know it is there. For the word to be in there, it will have to have a subject, a doer or an action. In the case of ‹to go›, the subject is me, so we can say: it has a me that does something. When looking at the rest of this clause, there is an object (a place where I can sit, see, eat and so on) and there are two other words that are doing the action of sitting and eating. There is also an auxiliary verb. Auxilliary verbs are like a ›helper‹ or ※assistant‼ to another verb in a sentence. You might be thinking that ′to have‽ and ″to will‰ are auxiliaries, too, right? Yes! But not the same as ‴go‴, to which I shall add two others: can and be. They have the function of being possible (we can can a thing, or be able to do something, like going out with our family). So when we look at this whole phrase, what happens? The subject me has two different words doing two things: ‍sitting‍ ‏and eating"

The key factors that a person must consider before starting working online, is that he must know what he can expect to do in the future and how much the income will vary as the time passes. The more a man knows about the work he is going to perform, the more he will have an idea about how well he would achieve his goals in that line of work. For those who want to work from Home but cannot do so because they lack knowledge. they can try this online job. One more thing to be considered before taking up a job online is to see how the company that offers to hire you treats their employees. Many times, companies hire only the ones who are available on their websites, leaving only those people to fill the rest of their vacancies and this is something which is not always correct. Thus, before joining such work opportunities make sure you are familiar with them. Do not take up the job just because it is in your vicinity. Be smart about it and only do it if you feel you would like to go that way. This is because you do not want your job to stop when you go home. So before going any further, make this point to yourself, if this opportunity is truly something you want. Once you know the kind of job you intend to pursue, then you need a clear idea which company does this sort of things.

Most people don'[t take care of their financial health.
This is because we live in an era where everyone thinks that they can get by without paying attention to their finances (I don’t think the situation is much different among those in other countries, but it is more widespread in North America) and when that happens, it can lead to some serious problems like bankruptcy or even personal injury. If you want to prevent these kinds of things, you need to be aware of the things going on in your life. This should be done by getting into it and paying some attention. That is what most of my posts are intended to show. I have to say that my knowledge on this subject is limited but I hope I can help people on my own journey into understanding it. There are a lot of people out there, myself included, that struggle with this topic. It can make one feel overwhelmed with so much information and data. My purpose here is to take you by the hand, step by step, to find the way that will help you to become aware and to understand the issues. You can do it!
The way I look at it there are two kinds:
1. Self-management
2. Consultations
I use self-education myself because I like to do things myself and get more information on the subject, rather than paying someone to make suggestions. On the other hand I also know that when we get information from other people we tend to forget it easily, so I find consultations to give me a reminder in a more reliable manner. In addition, when I am looking into a topic where I don`t have much experience, such as this one, consulting can also give some more valuable help. So I recommend this. Both methods work for me but you can use either or both. Just keep in mind that what you get from one method doesn't necessarily work if you use the same method for other issues in that area. Let's take a look now.I can see many options here, which one should I choose? There is no single best option. For example, the option I chose for the question above was:. Which is a good one to"
890,Where Do I Locate Topping Up With Cash.,Considering this utterance: Where Do I Locate Topping Up With Cash. What is the intent that best describes it?,"In what situation? Is it a statement of fact, a wish, an order, or maybe nothing?
And what exactly does it mean? What does the writer intend? This sentence has four main ideas. They are: the speaker, the location, what she/he hopes to do there, and what to expect after the activity (or the fact).

1.
Where do I located to topping up with cash? - I am looking for to buy something in a store and I want to be sure to have enough of the money in my bank account before going there. I hope I will not need money to get the food and the drinks. Is this a true statement? Well, it does not quite sound like what you would really expect a native English speaker to say. The most obvious problem is that it is wrong. It is true that in English we cannot use the word ""locate"" to indicate that something is located where we are talking about it. We can only use this term of location. But if someone says ""I would locate to buying a gift for my aunt"", we understand exactly what he means. He wants to purchase something to give to his aunt. So the meaning of ""Where Do You Located To Top Up? "" should be ""What is It You Are Looking For To Buy?"".
In this case, you should say:
""What would you located at getting to shop at the store?""
2. Where do you locate that? Can it be used as a question? Sure it can. And the answer will most likely include more than one item. Let us use that sentence: What do we locate at buying food here? Here there are several locations. If you have ever been to the restaurant you most certainly know the answers. You locate them when you get to their website or their telephone number. When you find the right website, on the top there is a box to input your personal details. Then the page will show the list of available restaurants. There you can choose and then buy. As you go to different locations to choose something from them you are sure you will be able to locate it when buying the item you need to eat. This way, using ""where"" as an adjective, ""locates"" can be considered as the noun. In fact the most common way to use these words in the same sentence would be to place ""to"" in"

892,Can I Add To My Account Balance With A Cheque?,Considering this utterance: Can I Add To My Account Balance With A Cheque? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Does this question have some other kind of answer besides this one? I think this sentence is a good example of the kind or quality of question that has two different meanings. I am looking for an answer that describes the different kinds of questions that can be asked using the words “Can I…” or ”Would I….“ or the like.

The word ‘can’ (or its equivalent in other languages) is often a verb, and has three different senses. (Note: This is different from the meaning of ’can,‘ which is an adverb. The verb can has five different usages, as listed in the dictionary. They are (in order of meaning) :
I can; You can„; I can not; We can / I cannot; They can.‛ ; I›m not able. [You can do it; She can sing; etc.]
These three senses, each of which may have a number of different forms, are called modal, conditional, or mood. There are five moods:
indicative, that is; the way it is. e.g. Can you drive? / We know you can! ; We do not know whether you will be able to drive. ; If you want to know, ask. etc., the modus ponens. 
possible, e g, We will not be home until five / until it‟s dark.;
imperative, I tell you this / this is imperative. : ‛Can you go? ‹ ;‚I order you to do something / something is being ordered. ‚ ; ‡‡; ‫‬; / or: ‟ „ †‹‰ ; or : I command you. / It is commanded to you, so do!; [I am sorry;]  You are sorry. You would be sorry if you did this; or I regret having told you of it. = imperative; imperative mood ; you must / you shall or we command. or it can mean conditional or potential
contrary, you are / it must be, etc. so, it / You must drive / The car must go; it will / They must not / etc.; (it / they must do this, do that, say,"
893,What Type Of Deposits Do You Accept Into My Account?,Considering this utterance: What Type Of Deposits Do You Accept Into My Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Does the speaker mean that the type of deposit they accept into their account determines the kind of account to which they deposit? Or does the statement mean the opposite of the preceding statement?

This week's grammar point was ""To Be"" or ""Has Been"", in the present tense. The first statement was given in answer to the question Why do you have a checking account? The speaker is explaining that he (the speaker and pronoun are implied to be male) has a ""checking"" account. In other words, he can make deposits in his bank and then write checks against his account in order to pay for his purchases. This is called a check-writing account, check account or bank account and is very useful.
The next statement in question is given next in an attempt to refute the first speaker. Does It? Why? What statement could be made to show that? A good way to answer this could go into the details of how this checking is used, or how checks are cashed. For example, if you can explain this in terms of a personal bank that has branches throughout the United States, and you give an example of such a place and the checks that can be c/ashed there. Another way is to use a business that uses the ""checks"" form, a bank form that is in use to collect payment for goods or services. You may mention a company that offers such services and explain the way that they collect payments (this might be through checks).
In a nutshell, in this case it is obvious that ""to be"" is not being used because the speakers are arguing, not in reference to something else. ""has been"" might come up if the topic were about someone who had a particular job, such as a professor, someone employed by a government agency, etc. It comes down to whether these statements are being offered as facts about how things are or are not. So the second speaker could respond that there are many checking accounts and they are called something different than ""check-account,"" but that's not important. He could also point out that many checks may be written for a person who is deceased, but it's also not a fact that all checks must necessarily be paid by cashing them at a Bank. However, you could not argue against the fact of there being ""accounts to check into,"" such an account would most likely be a Checking Account at"
894,Can I Top Up Using A Cheque?,Considering this utterance: Can I Top Up Using A Cheque? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I want to make sure that my money is topped-up when I want it and not before.

Is it more secure, faster, or is it something that we just did for convenience? Also, would it matter if it was an amount that I have not had access to, and therefore did not have available funds at the time? i.e. I would write the cheeck because I can't top-off with a debit card or credit card? Does this make sense for anything I am doing? I hope someone can help as this really has me stumped. 
Thank you
P.S. the reason why I ask is because my brother asked in a different context whether he can top up his phone by using his chequebook, I said no, then he said, it would probably be worth it just to avoid having to carry his wallet with him. It just got me thinking, how is my question even possible to answer, if I don't know the real answer. So I thought I might ask this question first. :)
Edit:
The reason I asked the question is not to annoy my younger brother, but rather to be able to understand how money works and also if the bank cheques are safe to use and if they are something you would use. In my opinion there are better ways to top that would save time and money. He is younger than me and he just likes the idea of paying with his bank check, rather then a card. But I understand that it is just a matter of taste. My question has just given me more to learn! :) Thanks for the answers. If I were to have a brother who had money and was a better saver than myself, the best way to save would definitely be to tell my older brother to keep all that money in cash, so that the savings is done. Then, in order for my friend to enjoy the money, he would need top ups! But how do they do that? Do they get cash on the way into work then top it up each morning? What I really want is information, not a solution or opinion. Thanks again for all the help. Sorry for taking"

What the answer is not is:
I need to top-up my Visa card because I forgot to put money on there. (You have to spend money to get money.)
This is a simple transaction error. If you need your money back, you will get it when the money you put on the card is spent.
If you have a valid charge on that card, the bank will honor it. Even if you top up a credit card with a cheque, and then later write a bad chequing account that will cause you to lose money."

I would say the latter. It's not a purchase intent, but a balance maintenance intent. The speaker wants to maintain his/her balance.
The reason we see this pattern is that we know that it is a maintenance utterances. We also know the verb that is typically associated with such utterings. Therefore, we can infer the other part of the sentence.

898,What Locations Can I Top Up With Cash?,Considering this utterance: What Locations Can I Top Up With Cash? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is the answer “what locations can I top up with cash” or ” what locations have a cash payout“? What about ‘Which restaurants have ATMs’ or‘I only go to the places I can use my own ATM card„? How about this one:  How to I go about getting more cash? Do I make an online ATM deposit or an ATM withdrawal? 
All these questions are about the same general idea – getting cash.  The words used have different nuances or flavors, so that they can mean different things. For example:
I can top-up my credit card with a card cashier.
Can I deposit money with credit or debit cards? Or, how do I get more money? Does anyone have any cash and can spare a dollar?‚‹
The word cash is used for money in our society, and so it will get a variety of different connotations in different contexts, which can be very difficult to understand. If you›‰were to ask the above questions about ATMS in a bank or a supermarket, then ‚what‬ ATM is‭ a more suitable word. I․‪have no idea why‌. The point is just that‮is that ‏cash‡has different meanings in different settings
So if you have‧a good idea‫of‖what the―question you want to make about, or the person you want to answer it,‣ then you can try the word‟cash, but the chances are that it‥will•mean‛something you don't※want. ‫And it's‽likely to confuse the matter more.—‴"

What is it’s context of use? (Who would use this? Where? Why?)
How is this used on a regular basis? Would it be used in speech? In writing?
I am not a native speaker but I am curious as to how this phrase should be phrased to make it sound better, or at least understandable by native speakers and native English speakers? Are there any other ways to convey the same intent? 

A:
There is actually a lot you can do here.
One thing that you might be missing: the fact that the first word of the sentence is ""I"". We can't always rely on grammatical correctness to mean something. The fact is: ""i wish"" is much more common in English than ""wish i"". You can imagine if we said ""want to i"" - that would be even worse!
So you may have to consider ""what"" in the context as well. You are right - ""top off my account"", but perhaps this is a ""money"" account.  So the best phrase here would probably be ""to top off [my] account"".
Also the ""using"" of ""cash"", instead of cash-like money, makes it more clear. It sounds to me like the person wants to pay for some things with some kind of money that is not just dollars - but that does not mean that that money is necessarily in his/her pocket. In other words: this might just mean ""in the form of"" cash. (That would still work, though.)
The last point would not really be part of this question. But I just want you to know that ""how to phrase things"" as you phrasethis is also important - so many people don't consider that, so they are surprised that other people are not as clear as they think they should."
900,Is There A Way To Do Top Up With Cash Deposit,Considering this utterance: Is There A Way To Do Top Up With Cash Deposit What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:
For a long time, I had a job where I was making a monthly salary of Rs. 10 Lacs.
I used to make two or three deposits at a time in the savings account. My deposits were always made in multiples of 10,000. I used a calculator to ensure that the amount deposited in both sides of the two sides matched. 
It was only in my last year at job that my salary was increased to Rs 12.75 Lakhs. After receiving the revised salary, it was my duty to deposit the salary to the bank. However, my bank was closed during the weekend. On Monday, the branch had reopened and I went to bank for my first deposit and withdrawal. To my surprise, when the banker saw my deposit slip which showed a sum of 12,75, she asked me to bring back the remaining balance of 25,50, as the current balance was insufficient to accommodate a deposit of 35,00!!!!!!!
The balance I brought to her was 25.50 and she gave me a receipt for that balance. That was the day I realised, banks do not like cash deposits. They want us to transfer our money using their system, which makes it much easier to do away with cash. So, for a while I didn't go to banks for making cash withdrawals. It was also difficult to open cheque books and send cheques when I have to pay for daily expenses. This is because I can't write chequebook balance higher than the chechebook I already had. All of this was very inconvenient. But, in spite of all these problems, till today I haven't changed my mind regarding the convenience of using bank accounts."

902,Can I Use Cash To Top Up My Account?,Considering this utterance: Can I Use Cash To Top Up My Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it

a) To be used with someone who is not in agreement to the above utterances.
b) A way to show off your power to your friends. (a bad idea)
c) An indication of the high value that you place on someone. You may have a large account that is being used on a daily basis. A daily cash top up. This might not be a bad thing because you could be in a financial need. It shows that your money is worth something to you and it could give a good impression to a potential mate. If you know that they may be interested in you. However if you do not intend to use it on them and are simply paying the value, then your intentions are not honorable and you may find yourself in trouble with your bank or your credit card company. The next time you use your card you might use too much and then you will pay for it. I would recommend that it is better if your intention is to help your financial situation rather than pay a high price to someone so you show your importance to them. In my opinion, I think it’s better to keep your account balance low and use cash whenever possible. But as long as you have it as an emergency fund, you can also top it up from your cash. Cash is a great and safe alternative to credit if they ask you for a top-up. Also note that if there is an ATM nearby, it can be more convenient to top your balance up, even to $1.00 to get $10. Then you would not have to rely on other people to do top ups for you, which can get expensive and inconvenient. Even if it costs a bit more to pay the ATM, and there might be long lines of people waiting, the amount you are paying to make a withdrawal is still a lot less than what you had in your savings. So, as a backup plan, there are still good reasons to have more money in there than a few dollars. That is how I see cash and credit cards. They both serve their purpose and each one has its pros and cons. As with everything, sometimes the right thing might cost a tad more. We are talking about the convenience though and the money saved. Now the question is, can I use money to buy something or to spend my money on something that I want to? The answer would be, yes, provided"
903,How Can I Top Up With Cash?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Top Up With Cash? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This utterances is used to introduce a question.
""How Can You Top-Up With Money""
(I.E. How much cash can you get?) ""How can I top up with money?""
The answer to the question is ""You can top-up with more cash"".
Is this the right use of this word. I feel that ""more"" is more appropriate to express the meaning of ""how much"". I think ""can"" means ""capability"". Is this true, please correct me if I am wrong. 
For example, ""I can't eat more"" doesn't seem to make sense to me. But "" I can eat a lot"" does. Please help me understand this. Thank you. :-)
P.S. This is for a test paper. A native speaker will take the exam and give it a grade. The test is on English grammar and vocabulary. So please help, I don't have enough time. Thanks!
Update:
What did I misunderstand? Please correct what I asked. :) Thank You! :-)   I thought ""top- up"" was used for adding more money to a mobile phone. Can it be used more than that?  Does it mean ""up to"" like when we say ""you can buy a new house""? Does the word  ""with"" also play its role here? Is there a better way to use top  up? It has an effect. If you have less cash, you can not buy anything, or you will go to your boss and ask for the loan? If the money you topup is not enough, your money will not increase, right? Thank u!  :-) Again, this is just one of my English questions. In the final paper, another one says ""Top- Up"" instead of top. Does this mean it is a different meaning too? :-) Sorry for confusing u guys. :-(  Thanks again for all you guys' comments. Your help is appreciated. It's already a great start! :-D
Thanks! :)

I’d like to think I‘m quite a good writer. If I say so myself.
A bit like myself, in fact. And I have read, and still read a lot of stuff, which means there is a fair chance I am good in that. I can give my thoughts on some things, I think. But in reality, writing is like any other skill that you might learn. There is plenty of things that can go wrong. In my opinion, one of the worst things you can do is write something that nobody reads. It is just wasted time and energy. You might as well not have written it at all. So what is it you intend to do when you write, to whom, where and why? In the case of this post, my intention is to try and write about some of my writing techniques and some thoughts that might help you as a writer, so I hope some people actually do read it. Let‟s see. Where to start. Ok, this is actually what I like. A question, a start, an end. My name is Jon. This is what started my love affair with writing. Some people may already know this, but I want to share it with you anyway. To get things started, here is an example for you all
„I have not written for a few years now. As you know, the last time I had a new post on my blog was back in 2011. When I started this blog I wrote quite often. The last post was in May 2011, back then it was titled „The New World“, with some words about the new iPhone coming. That post has disappeared from the old blog. However, it did not disappear from Google. Now it is one page down in my Google searches, for the search words I mentioned above, i.e. the name of that post and one or two words from it like ‚cheque‰ for example.‹ Well, if you are a regular visitor on this site you probably already saw that I just added another blog to my sites. Which is why you now see a blog post titled ""The Future Of The World"" (in Dutch). I would love to have the same number of visitors on that"

It's a kind of questioning word, used when you're trying to draw a conclusion about something by asking a question. You've got to ask your own question if you want to know what it's like to drive a truck. To ""ask"" a certain question is called to ""raise"" the question:
To raise a proposition to a hypothetical situation is to suppose or to pretend (usually in the passive voice): to suggest a thing or question in which it would be true, or as if it were true (as in ""What I'd really like is a house with a pool"").
If you ask the right kind question, you can find the answer for yourself.

913,Can I Top Up My Account With A Cheque?,Considering this utterance: Can I Top Up My Account With A Cheque? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Insight Question:
Which of the following are true according to the meaning of Can? Can you describe the best way of using this word according this insight? What might be the implications that you see with regard to our topic? How could the context affect it, if any at all? Write a few sentences.
1) Can implies possibility but may not. You can say I am going there and do not imply that I may actually. I can go there but I might not find someone there to speak to. Can means you might or you cannot. For example: ""I can drive, but can you drive with me?""
2) A can is a verb that is used to show possibility. We can do something. This implies that we can. It does not mean that it must be done. ""You can get the water from the kitchen, it is right there on the shelf."" This means that the object is on its shelf, I do have it. If you say ""The water is there"", the it means ""We will drink the cold water"" but the implication is that that water has been there for some time and we cannot do much about it other than drink it
3) You cannot take something and say you have this. Instead you must say, ""Can I take/have/buy/see/hold?"" You use the verb can for things, animals or people. Take means if someone takes something away from you, they took it away. Someone can buy means they can take it to buy. There may be other verbs of action to mean something you can have or do. Have to/can take or have to means something is done to you. When you take a picture, there is no can in it but you may use ""take"" to describe what happens. Some verbs can express more than one way to say. See for example ""can"" and ""may"" in these two lines. They both can mean possibility: He will see the sea tomorrow. He may see it or may have a dream about seeing the ocean. The context will help you decide which meaning is closest to their meaning. In some cases, the difference is not that great. A good way is to look at their difference in meanings to decide. Here it seems that He might see may mean he will. Or he might dream of seeing. (I'm not sure I understand your question"

915,"I Have A Cheque Here, Can I Use It To Top Off My Account?","Considering this utterance: I Have A Cheque Here, Can I Use It To Top Off My Account? What is the intent that best describes it?","If the answer is “Pay a bill,” you can use the check as a voucher to obtain services. But if the response is in terms of the transaction, you may be asking yourself ‘Can I use it to pay a credit card bill?’ In this scenario, the context of ’paying a check‘ is replaced with more generic terms in order to make it more appropriate for this application.

What are the key elements of this transaction? The check itself, a statement from you, and cash are all the items used to complete the payment. To complete this request, we start the process by adding a ‗request-payment‖ object to our account. This is done by calling the ‑addRequestPayment‑ method of our ′requestAccount′ object. When the system receives this call, it starts a request-process that we will use to process the request for you. At its core, this is a simple process of getting the cashier at your retail location to take the money for the account and then process a payment transaction. The process involves three steps:
1. Get the merchant. Your request can be handled by any merchant with this account type (and account number). To get the location with which to conduct this service, call the method ‪requestMerchant‬ and pass your ‫requestPaymerAccount‭ object as the argument. You may specify your own „merchant account“ object if you wish, or the current system ‚currentAccount' will be used if it exists (as is usually the case). This method returns a merchant object that can either be queried via the methods ″MerchAccount.findByName (or byAccountNum),″ or that contains all methods needed to service the client‟s request. For example, to get a list of all ‡Merchat‡ accounts with ‹name==› ”My Account:‹„, simply do ‬ ‪‚myAccountName.merchant′‮‫‛.all().‣   
2. Make the deposit. Once the desired merchant is retrieved, make the actual cash deposit into the checking account using the appropriate ‟deposit•‰ method, as"

The sentence:  Can I get a physical credit card that is free on the first transaction? means that there might exists a product called 'a physical card with no card fee' but no credit cards with 'no card fees' exist.

918,How Do I Get An Actual Card?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Get An Actual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This is a very interesting question because of the variety of ways in which people interpret the question.
I'm assuming you are asking for information regarding the meaning of this sentence with the word, actually. So, if I understand you correctly, you want to know how one would go about acquiring a card. 
If that is correct, then there is no one answer, because there are so many variations. For example:
Would you purchase one from an actual shop or from someone you know?  Or, would you get one as an act of generosity or just because it has sentimental value in the relationship? Or perhaps you would purchase a set for an entire family? And, what if you were trying to have a memorable birthday or anniversary? Would you have one for a particular occasion or do you go out of your way to make every moment memorable? What about getting a bunch at once to show appreciation for someone's hard work or for making you a valued customer? These are all very good answers to the original question, but they could still be further extended, which shows the range of interpretations possible when answering the title question ""How Do You Get an Actual, Printed Card?""
There are, of course, even more ways to ask the same, more specific question as well. How to get a nice one, where to buy from, who makes them, and if it matters what kind... These sorts of questions have many different answers and can get very personal. The most effective answer to this would have to be an interpretation of what type of card you personally want, the purpose of getting it and how to go and find out how and for what you really want. And even then, it varies widely from person to person. But, that should also answer your question: ""What is meant by this phrase?"""

Maybe you just wanted to know what the definition of “real‘ was. So this is your answer…
This question is for testing whether you understand the meaning of the word ‘real.‚
Here is another example of a sentence where ‚real′ is used in a different way, so be careful:

If you have a disposable virtual card and someone steals it or it's lost, you can get a new one and continue. If the disposable card were the goal, then there would be no point in creating the card until it was lost or stolen. It's a safety valve. In most cases, I would agree. But what if they aren't going to use the item? Then, what's the point of creating it and maintaining it. Why would I need a ""temporary"" card to access something that is temporary? I'm going for the same thing, and I am the temporary. So, why bother to create a temporary card? The disposable item is intended to be lost (or stolen). Then the question becomes; is it necessary to have an additional item, just in case, the original disposable one is lost/stolen? That's wasteful, it adds overhead, maintenance, risk of loss, etc. and does little more than make life more difficult for everyone involved. This doesn't even address the potential for a more permanent loss or theft. That would just add more overhead. A simple temporary ""emergency"" is adequate. I'd rather spend money creating a product that can help people than spend time creating products that are just a backup option."

In this context, a “response” is understood to mean any answer of some type, and ‘intent’ is used to cover any and all such possible answers, in any given context. A response may be: a response to an uttering, an interpretation or understanding of an intended meaning, even though not expressed, of that utter, etc. Each of the possible ’intents‘ is considered separately below. [Please note, the order of these paragraphs is intended to help the readers in understanding the flow of this post.]
As a preface to the answers to these questions…
Consider this statement:
“My Dispose Virtual is broken‖. What might it mean? In other words, consider the following three possible interpretations: (1): My Virtual Computer is not working. (2): I have not been able to use it. I don‚Äôt understand how to work around it.. (3): It is a problem with this computer which I am not sure how fix.„
(1) Is it a literal, exact, precise description? No, as it is missing key elements that would be present in a complete expression, including ‚‛My‰. It could mean „ I do not have any way to access to my computer. ‟ However, that could include other, more serious, problems such as ‹my computer‹ is out of power. In this case, it does not say clearly that you cannot access your PC. This statement does, however, suggest some sort of problem. Thus, we do get some information about your condition from this expression: Your. If we consider it in this light we can then consider its meaning as one that is in the present simple indicative of something which has the potential to happen in future (as opposed to ‰¥t is likely to be happening now).
We might also use the phrase, ‛ÆThe system is down‟ (e.g. in an email or other message), although a less likely possibility than ›ÅThe Disposition is broke (with the Disposal being your computer and the expression being present perfect).. This expression would, again"
923,My Non-Physical Card Will Not Work,Considering this utterance: My Non-Physical Card Will Not Work What is the intent that best describes it?,"a. A desire or attempt to stop using the card, in which case, it would be an attempt by the physical entity to take over, because the non-physical entity can’t handle the “hard” work of controlling it.
b. Or it could be a desire to be left alone, so that the entity‘s efforts are free to do other things. In which scenario we say the message is ‘positive“
c. An expression of dissatisfaction in the use of the device, such as, „I don‟t understand why I can use this and my own card does not„. (The entity is dissatisfied in this situation and wants to make things more difficult).
d. To express one‚s displeasure with a situation, but still wish to have the ability to carry out a task. For instance, if the person in question is very upset about what is being done and still wants the opportunity to buy lunch, then this statement would express the intention that would best fit with this. Here you want to express that one wants a way to work and doesn‪t want a ‪part of your time consumed with it; it is just a nuisance and you don't want it to affect your ability. You would want the task to go on, while you are still being inconvenienced by it, as there is no real negative affect on you. Your ‫‬intent‭  is to still complete this task, with the understanding that it might not go as it should because of this issue you encountered. It is in an ′I want´ mood‫."

They: I can’t accept your payment for this reason.
That seems to be pretty clear. 
I think the confusion here occurs because:
It is not clear how it is “payment” and ” for what“, that is, payment to what entity, gym or the individual that paid the gym. So the next thing to consider is whether this is payment of a particular debt which this card represents or is it just an account that was used by the previous owner for payment. To me, it seems like it may be the former. Is this the case, I have not been able to find a definitive answer on the internet and it might just be that I‘m reading this wrong. But in the situation in my question, does payment mean payment towards what the card was created for? or does it mean a payment that will pay the cost of the goods in question. The former seems the most likely as to do with the latter, seems more like an extension of an earlier question that came before, which is more on topic in this case of asking a question on an SE site. I am not sure where to go with that, but I think I would be asking for something that doesn‡„ˆt make sense or be of much use or that you cannot find the answer to, for example.

This is a problem that I'm getting now after I made a transaction. Is my money really in my account but I couldn't see or get it. It's been like this for the last few days. My virtual wallet is not on my screen but when I click on ""Get my wallet"" i can only see that it has no balance. If i click to see my balance again, it says the same thing.

929,My Disposable Virtual Card Will Not Work,Considering this utterance: My Disposable Virtual Card Will Not Work What is the intent that best describes it?,"My intention is to make this statement to describe the situation I was given by the vendor of a product I bought. My problem occurred due to misprinting. Or I guess I can call it a mistake. This is a case study of customer service from the seller’s perspective. The seller could not have anticipated that this error would occur and the customer could have avoided that situation by paying extra attention to reading. But there are a few problems I have with this story:

1. It is an isolated example of misprinted content. Is this the only misprinter error I‘ve encountered with that product? What about other products? 2. There is no indication the person is being dishonest. They do not make claims they can‟t deliver. 3. No apologies are made. 4. I am not informed of any changes in their customer experience.
5. Why are the details not disclosed for a better customer relationship management (CRM) process?
6. How to handle a situation this way? I don”t feel valued and appreciated. Should I keep the issue and never shop there again? Maybe, maybe not – but it seems the company has no desire to change or improve the experience in the future? The situation is not improved, but is made only worse, so I would keep this information to use for my next shopping experience with the same company. If the product is worth the extra money, it should be worth having a great experience!
7. Can customer reviews be considered fair? How can a company respond with transparency without being deceptive?"
930,I Cannot Use My Disposable Virtual Card.,Considering this utterance: I Cannot Use My Disposable Virtual Card. What is the intent that best describes it?,"I cannot use my disposable virtual credit card because (it's not valid/expired/not a true representation of the issuer).
What are the possible intents that this could represent? 
1) The person is too cheap and wants to buy with a virtual card.2) Too stupid and doesn't realize that there's a limitation3) They're just lying4) What? No really, I can't use it5) He/she was just playing around with the question...
Note: This is not in reference to: Why can’t we use our virtual cards?.   That question is asking about the limitations of a card that does not have a physical card counterpart.
EDIT: If #1 is correct, is #2: The card is invalid/fake? Is there any difference between invalid and fake? What exactly is fake when referring to these type of accounts that don't actually represent any credit or payment accounts (i.e., virtual debit/credit cards)?
Is there a name for this type, virtual/disposability, that I'm unaware of? How would an expert in this field describe what is going on? And is there ever a situation where #4 comes into play? (I've never heard of it before, but I have never asked a customer to try anything.)  Thanks. :)
Also, please don‘t consider this as a duplicate since this is focused on virtual and disposable accounts and not virtual vs virtual transactions. Also, this has to do with how the card works (as in, can it be used at all.) not the limitation with virtual transaction limits and virtual wallets. Thank you, guys!
UPDATE:
There is no name. This would be a term used to describe the use of an account not to represent a payment/debit-credit card but as just a tool to play around without having to pay, to test, etc. In fact, there is a whole market of this kind of account. So, no, not really. If you look at the definition of fake, it‚Äôs very close to what they are doing. They have no intention of using the tool for what it's intended, for the purpose of financial transactions, thus it is NOT fake. The purpose is just to create a ""tool"" in their mind to use for their experiments without paying."
931,Can I Make Multiple Online Transactions With My Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Can I Make Multiple Online Transactions With My Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"If you answered “no” to this question, you will be making a serious mistake. I am going to share 5 reasons why a person should take out multiple lines of credit with credit cards online.
I am not a credit card company. But I have been doing online business for over 7 years and I know a thing or two about the credit industry and how it works today. If you have your own thoughts about that industry you may want to stop reading here and start at the beginning. Otherwise, keep reading. It’s not going away. And if you are thinking of becoming a card-seller yourself, I‘d suggest you do some online research and find out whether it is really what you want. This article and its contents may not be a true representation of how the online payment industry works. In order for it to be accurate, there would have to a be no commissions, no fees, and no credit checks. That is not the case today and will not ever be the norm. Let‚s just say, this article does a great job of explaining why you should have multiple credit lines, so you can handle multiple situations, all under the umbrella of a single credit limit. Now let‛s get started!
Reason number 1 – You can save money
When you take on a high credit line you make more money by using that money to purchase products and services. On top of that, the higher-priced lines have higher credit limits. Thus, when you reach your credit cap, it will take less of your money and you“ll be charged less for those purchases. All of these savings add up to big savings. How? Let me explain. The higher the price of the item, in percentage terms, then the more of it you buy with each card. For example: Let's say you wanted to buy a $100 item or an item with a purchase price equal to 5% of $1,000. You would spend $5 per each item. As a result, a 1,500 credit on your $15,400 limit would buy you about $20 in items each billing cycle, but an 8,800 credit would only buy about 3 items. At the end of each month, if the high limit card holder has a low credit utilization ratio, he or she will have hundreds of dollars of free spending money. A high"

934,Why Can'T I Use My Virtual Card For Subscription Services?,Considering this utterance: Why Can'T I Use My Virtual Card For Subscription Services? What is the intent that best describes it?,"You're trying to find a reason why you can't use a virtual card for subscription services? Perhaps this is because your card is an ""all or nothing"" card? You can pay for services with a single card, but you cannot pay a service once with one card and then pay another with another? What happens if you try and use the card that way to pay two services that have the same card in use? How would those be handled? The point of this answer is not to answer the question itself, merely to get people to realize why we do some of the things we are doing.
If I'm paying for a subscription with my virtual cards, and I only pay once, I get the first month for free, or my first three months for half the price ($8 vs the $24 price per month), if I pay monthly for that subscription, why would I want to try to use my card once for payment and have two different services paid for each month from that one single use of my credit card. It makes no sense to me. I don't see why the credit cards are used to buy services monthly, if that were to happen, wouldn't it make sense that the person that owns the service is paid monthly from one bank account and their services are paid once and that payment is taken out from the user? I know that makes sense, so that is all I am wanting to accomplish. Why do we try? Is it because it is something that we have been accustomed to and it makes us feel secure in what we know and what is easy to us? But what if we don' know what happens to this card when we use it to purchase services for this month, we get a bill at the end of our next month and we aren't even sure what happened to our card because we did not use/expect to be charged that much more money for the month at that time because our monthly payment was taken from our virtual account? It would just make more sense if our payment were taken directly from a person/person's bank statement each week or each day? So then what do you think about this question? Would that be better for people or this way, it has always worked for us because all of them are virtual accounts? Why? Do they pay the owner of that service or is it a different payment? And why can I still use one credit"

If this is a simple typo, then it could cause you a lot of money to try to charge a credit card with an incorrect amount or use a card number in the wrong way.
So it makes sense to correct it, but if this doesn't seem to bother you too much, there isn't a need to do so. If you feel the need, you'll do well just to add 'Not' to your intent."

A:
“My Disposeable

What do you think is your main intent, or meaning that describes the utterances? What kind of emotion do that cause? It is a bit difficult to decide the main topic of your sentence as the information conveyed is not sufficient. You might be better off with the following alternatives
Sentence: I had a chance to buy a pair of shoes today, but my disposable virtual card got rejected.

939,How Can I Fix A Problem Where My Virtual Card Is Rejected?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Fix A Problem Where My Virtual Card Is Rejected? What is the intent that best describes it?,"It sounds like an angry man is blaming others for all of the trouble.

The other meaning is much more positive. This means that there was a problem for which you were attempting to solve by fixing. You were trying to get rid of something by solving it. So, when you say: He tried to fix that problem. I guess the question is: what is your intention in using it as an expression?
-
It can also mean the following: You need to know that it’s important to make the problem worse, not solve it!
Example of usage:
In the first example the speaker is mad because of his trouble and his frustration, the second example could be used to mean that one should only focus on the problems. It could mean “I have a big problem that I really want to focus and fix, because that”, while ‘That‘ could either be something you like, something that doesn“ like you or something else that can be described. The speaker in the example wants to show that he isn„t interested to spend his time solving a small, insignificant problem, but solving something big, important and meaningful."
940,My Virtual Card Isn'T Working. What Do I Do?,Considering this utterance: My Virtual Card Isn'T Working. What Do I Do? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Intent
: The best way to understand the meaning of a statement is to consider what the speaker was
likely thinking or planning to think. In the case of ""My Virtual
Card Isn't Working,"" what could it be? It could be that the
sender was upset about being unable to access his or her computer's
card-reading software, so he or she used the verb ""aren't"" to
describe it. It might, however, also be intended to convey a
less-than-positive sentiment, such as the sender being annoyed that
he or the receiver was unable, at that very moment, to perform a task.
Or perhaps the sentence could suggest the need to use a separate
device to read the data stored on another card. Whatever the situation
might have been, this speaker likely wants you to be aware of it!
The intent is clearly positive when the statement includes the words
""work"" and ""working"" in the same sentence. However, the negative
meaning is not lost by simply omitting the second verb. For example,
a different intent might be indicated by saying, ""I can't find my
Virtual Card.""
In fact, if the first verb is ""find,"" then a speaker may use this
phrase to express his/her need for help. But the best method of
discernment is simply to pay attention to the context and the actual
words. A good rule of thumb is that a good ""intent"" for
any phrase is determined by the purpose for uttering that phrase. That
said, sometimes the simple substitution of another verb may be
sufficient to change the tone and affect your understanding of the message. Here's a simple example: ""Can
I Help You?"" vs. ""May I Help you?""
Another useful technique is offered by using ""to"" with ""be""
to form the phrase ""is to."" For instance: We are all human, and so
are you and I. This statement can also mean ""It is important that we
be human."" In fact it is almost always safe to interpret an
unusual phrase as being positive unless there is a negative reason for thinking it should be negative. So, it may not necessarily be a safe
assumption from this sentence that you should infer the person is
upset about his card"

What is the intent that best describes it?,"To pay for something, to pay a bill, and a lot more, it is one of the most spoken things in the world. To a business man like me, who are in a hurry to make payment for their services or purchases, this phrase will always trigger a certain response. I was able to identify a customer care center by this response that I received from the Virtual card in question, which I had a great transaction with this particular company. A representative from Virtual Visa customer service team asked me if I can help to resolve my problems, since this is a case where my virtual card does not seem to be working at all. The customer rep assured me that they are ready to help out, but he/she said it will be a bit complex for him/her.

First of all, I am not sure if the card was activated or is already being used, because of that the rep is asking me to do a card balance check. This is because the amount that is being paid will not be reflected in my account balance. It is just like the balance that will show in your checking account, where we will pay money that comes in. So, what the representative mentioned about the complex process will definitely apply. But there are two ways in which he can be able for me. First is that he will use the online tool available on my Virtualcardaccount.com, while the other option would be to send me the account number and pin that should be put in for the process of payment. After I did the mentioned things, the customer agent informed me about this:
I have done the above, as I understand it, correctly, if not it can get confusing. My virtualcardbalance should display the transaction history so I’m thinking it shows the charges. He mentioned that my balance will display, so, there is some reason why I could not see it. And also, my customer account is not working because he said that there was some “glitch” with the network. If the problem of network is solved and I have the right balance, could it be possible for us to go back to where I left off. Since it was just a couple of purchases? The transactions of virtual cards is like a real card, except that it would show that transaction. That is when my question comes back. What do you mean by transactions?

I have heard several different types of utterances that are considered grammatically correct.
Is the following one of them considered a grammaticality error? (I've seen it used in a number of books that I have read, in the last few years.) (Please, excuse the formatting of my post, I was not sure how to put it in here)
When I try to use it at a point of sale transaction. (This is how I am hearing it, but perhaps is incorrect.)
In response to your other question, here is one example sentence that illustrates the difference in usage. 
""My car is out of gas. I would like you to fill it up so that it can be used again.""
This sentence could be gramatically said as: ""The car outgas is gas that is being used. The car no longer has gas."". But, you could only do this in response: When ""I would"" want you and ""It is"" the car. So: It no ""outgas"" can use or use again. It can just be the gas and not use the word ""gas"". It's just out gas as in ""When that out-gas, the engine will overheat"". I know, it's a little complicated, so if you don't understand, go with the first option (the correct one), that my car has no gas, to get the full picture."
948,My Transaction Was Just Declined When I Was Using My Disposable Virtual Card. What Can I Do?,Considering this utterance: My Transaction Was Just Declined When I Was Using My Disposable Virtual Card. What Can I Do? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I can't even tell if this is intended to be ironic. The only clue I've seen is that ""using"" can be used in two very distinct ways.
One way is to use the word ""you"". The other is ""as"", e.g. ""You need to buy more gas with your credit card"". If intended, I can see this as a joke at the expense of the credit company that declined your transaction. Perhaps it was a one-time thing, or perhaps it has happened before. If this was intended as an ironic comment, is there any better or more concise way to make the comment? It doesn't feel like there is any good way in the situation where it is used ""correctly"": as in: ""Using"" is correct. I have used it correctly. It says ""The following item has been added."" in my e-mail, so that is how I know. But it could just as easily be written as: Using Is a Correct Term. Or perhaps the use of ""it"" refers to that statement. In either case, it seems like it's just saying that using is a correct term. So that would explain the whole situation, but it still does not explain why it said ""my transactions was just declined"", even though ""transactions"" and ""declined"" are not the same thing. Why does it seem to imply that the transactions is something else, unless it means that there was some form of error on the part of Visa? Or was someone just being weirdly pretentious? I'm having a hard time parsing the sentence to arrive at anything else than the last question. Thank you!

What is my name? This is why I asked for a better answer. @SJuan76, this looks like just a comment from a bot, probably a part that you can disable if you have your email, and if not you should probably look into making a support ticket, if they can provide an explanation, which they probably can.

949,My Disposable Virtual Card Is Not Working,Considering this utterance: My Disposable Virtual Card Is Not Working What is the intent that best describes it?,"The best way to learn to communicate effectively with people is to talk about your own experiences. It takes some practice, but the more you practice it, the better you will be in your communications with others. In particular, this communication technique is very effective for when you’re talking to someone, especially at a job interview.

But, first off let‟Òªs get some basics out of the way. This is about talking about yourself and answering some questions. I‒‰Ì‹Á¡ýt recommend this as a first communication style. The reason for this is if someone asks you these questions, their intent probably isn't to judge you. For that, just keep calm and speak as you would normally in everyday life.

How do I get my disposable virtual card to work? (1 point)
Explanation: I need this for my work.
I think this is a general question about the meaning of life. But it has a technical meaning. The person who made the card is trying to get money for her work and get it to run. She wants to use the disposable (or disposable, disposable) virtual money card for this purpose. So, the person thinks of how she can get her disposable payment card so that she might be able to have a better life in the future."
951,How Come My Disposable Virtual Card Used To Pay For A Gym Subscription Got Rejected?,Considering this utterance: How Come My Disposable Virtual Card Used To Pay For A Gym Subscription Got Rejected? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Here are the answers that were given for the essay.
1st answer:
It is a request for clarification about the payment made and also the use of that amount. It is not to show your opinion. So, you are required to stick to the facts of the case. Your answer will be accepted as well. However, don't get into any kind of controversy as per the fact of case which is being shared with you. If you do get caught up in an attempt to prove that something did not happen or did, which it is evident is something you won't be able to do. You will only have to clarify the question asked. The answer that you submit will have all the details that is important to be known to make a conclusion. All your points should be clearly understood. Remember, your answer must be supported by the information provided or the questions asked in the prompt. Also, do not add any additional information. Just make sure to answer all aspects of how the gym subscription was paid with the virtual card. Include all details. Do not leave it vague. This will make your essay look like an unauthentic one. There are many things going on as to why it was rejected and the reason why you want to know all these details are also important. In such a case, there are multiple ways to approach in a way that does not look fake. But for this purpose, the best approach would be to explain the situation. When your professor reads your answers to these questions, they will get an idea about what you think, why, and what the main points are in this essay that should make it successful. Make sure, that all your facts are backed or explained. They are very clear. Be very precise and make everything that needs to happen very clearly. Try your best to give answers which are specific and detailed enough so that the professor is able understand all of it. Even if a part of your work requires revision, make the changes as soon as possible. Don't leave them to go through the whole paper just to notice that there is an error. Once you have made all that revision and you still find errors, then you need to take time and think about how to rectify it and come up with a plan of action. After thinking about it, try to implement it with as much success as is needed. Good luck."

It is best to look at it as a sentence and analyze it to see its function in the text.  It is used to describe an event which has taken place, namely what happened to that cashier.
You cannot take the word 'when' as being related to its context in this sentence - it cannot be an auxiliary verb - and it is not related in form to the other clause. You need to find what it refers to, and only then look for the verb. The closest verb to 'cashier' is 'determine' but it doesn't work in a passive sense."

I Would Not Have Used The Atm If I Had Known! What is the intent that best describes it?,"1) What kind of intent is it: the speaker intends to tell you what he thinks you ought to think. (It isn’t the same if we change the question: what kind do we believe is true?)
2) Is it something the speakers want to make you feel: angry or upset
3) It is something he is happy or proud of: to show you he has something better
4) Or, the opposite of 4) – It isn't something that he wants to hide from you
5) A warning to others: this is what you may think, so don‘t do it!
6) Something that is a bit of an exaggeration, or a way of joking around:
7) An expression of a need or want: What he really wants is for me to do this.
8) I don't have the answer, but I thought you might! (This is an invitation to give a reply.)
9) He can't think of it (for now)
10) To say in general: The fact that the person does not have a ready reply is usually taken to mean that they would be ashamed or embarrassed to say no, and so it can be a polite way to refuse something – it doesn‟t mean you are not allowed to answer. In the past people were not as open about refusing things. But if you ask a friend if they are going out, they don not answer with ""No"", just say ""I don want it"". That is to let you know you can tell them ""You are free"" and be honest. A similar thing happens with friends in India and Pakistan, where people in social gatherings will be very blunt about who they do not want as a guest. So they say, ""Do you want me?"" ""Well, I want no one."" This is different from ""no"" as in ""Yes, he can come, it's ok"" which is like the UK ""Sure, that's fine"". It means ""yes"".

960,Can I Get A Description Of How To Use A Disposable Virtual Card,Considering this utterance: Can I Get A Description Of How To Use A Disposable Virtual Card What is the intent that best describes it?,"How would you answer it in your own words?

A: The intent is to give a description of how to use a disposable virtual card for credit card applications. How to is a common term in business. The common way to describe an activity is by giving the description. In this sentence, the speaker describes how the listener can use disposable cards.
Example: “You would use one of these cards for your applications, like when you are buying something online.""
B: This could also be written more like: You could get a reusable card and then use the disposable one. I am not sure what you mean by disposable. But the example I have given is something you would say about a virtual credit/debit card. A more generic term would be ""disposables"" - but then what do you do with them? I think that you need to think about what the actual purpose of the virtual (dis)card would have to be for you to actually use it. (This is just a suggestion though - please let me know if you think it makes sense).
C: It's a bit long isn't it - can we make it a shorter version of A. ""You can get disposable/reusable cards online"" is what we have here. This is also a good example of a very common business phrase - you have used the term ""a lot"" and ""how to"" together for example. If you write it more simply you could say: ""How to get the same card you use for online shopping."" You can see a more common example here: How-to-say-how-do-i-apply-for-a-job."
961,Can I Create A Disposable Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Can I Create A Disposable Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it meant to be funny? Serious? Informational?

This utterances was created in a very specific environment, and the author of this post might be a bit biased because of that.
Also, it doesn’t really have a context. So, there‘s no way to really tell what it means without knowing more information. You could just guess, but that might not be right. This post is here to help you think about what is really meant by uttering ‘Can I create a disposable virtual card?”
Before you start thinking about writing this, here‹s the situation: You‚ve just been given a new set of card. They are a little bit bigger (or the same size) than your own ones. And, they‡re a lot better than the old ones you were using. These cards are going to live for your lifetime. No need for any recycling. Ever. The first step would be that you want to get a ‚„card› into your hand. Because, you do not have any other. How can you get it to? Well, the easy way would‰ be to simply ask your virtual assistant to ′“Create a Disposeable Card‛ and get one out. Now, is that easy to do? You don‪t have to worry about anything else for now. Yes, a virtual ‹card ‮‗is a thing. It will look similar to an actual card, as most real world objects do. That is, if you have access to a set to design and build it. But we‱can t build the entire world. Only the world we are working on and have control over. ‬‬
But why is it that a card is something that gets handed out? What if we were to use a piece of software as a medium for this? That would make way more sense. There are many virtual software products out there. Some of the most popular ones being,‖ Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft Surface, Adobe Photoshop, The Sims 4.  And they all have „Cards‟.

What is the intent that best describes it?,"To what, or whom, can you tell it to? Can you even tell about it, as it is a statement of fact and not an offer?
How should this kind of question be handled? 

A:
–  I will be using this card, for a virtual disposable.   It is for my  business  purpose  but  not for personal.
You are right that it does not really make any sense. In most cases, when you are talking about a particular tool or technology, it should be accompanied with a noun that is something about the item - i.e. it’s a tool for doing this, not it can do this. But it doesn't have to be a single noun. You can use the plural: ‘I will buy a bunch of those‘ is an example. A couple of examples from elsewhere on the site:  What's the difference between 'a set and a pack' and 'an entire pack'? and What can be the main difference in between a group and an organization?"
963,I Would Like To Order A Disposable Virtual Card. How Can I Do This?,Considering this utterance: I Would Like To Order A Disposable Virtual Card. How Can I Do This? What is the intent that best describes it?,"If you're like me, it's probably this intent:

To order a disposable virtual card which is similar to a credit card or debit card.
I would like to have this card be used to buy something online. This is a quick transaction and the purchase of this item is not long term. The virtual credit/debit card should expire in 24 hours or less after purchase. It should not be a prepaid virtual wallet. I only wish to spend from this virtual debit/credit card as needed. So if I need to order something like a pair of shoes from a company like Nike, I would only be using this debit or credit virtual bank card once. And I will be able to use it again. But I do not want to store money from it on a computer or smartphone or anywhere on the Internet. No, there will not need be any funds stored in the virtual account that is being used by the card issuer. (This will happen by way of a physical debit credit or prepaid bank account).
So the question is: Who is this for? Is it for an online retailer? An individual person? Or is it a card that someone is creating from scratch?
This may be the same as How to make a virtual ""credit"" card?, but not exactly. Also, the answers may also be similar, but that doesn't mean either are the answer. Let's see if we can find a good answer to fit. 
And this question, Virtual credit cards - what to consider? is an example of the type of question that I'm hoping to see an answer for. However, that question has a different focus. My focus here is on creating a debit and credit like card, not a question about creating virtual cards."
964,How Do Vr Cards Work,Considering this utterance: How Do Vr Cards Work What is the intent that best describes it?,"This utterances can have different meanings and are usually described in a context. I think that this context will help to understand what is really meant by each utterace.
First I will show the context of this dialog, then I’ll try to interpret each of them, and finally I present examples from the corpus for further reference. The dialog is:
“We have some VR card decks for sale if you”re interested‘ ( [‮‭‱‬1‫:„2:8″]‪, ‹›[1:11‥1]))‏     ․‰‚‡‛‽‖…‷
I think we could say that the first meaning that comes to mind is “How do VR cards work?‟. For example, a person says that ‘he is buying VR decks, which one do you have? ” and you reply to him „How VR deck does work ‟
In that case, we can interpret this meaning as ‐ a) ‪asking ‬about ‱how ‭cards ‫work  ‐ (a card game) b) ask ‡about the ․deck itself c)‣ask about the cards
But there is a second meaning in addition: ′ How  do ‮cards work′ ‧ ? In this case the question would have the same meaning for any cards, so it could be interpreted as a reference to one or more specific decks. In the example of the utterence, the speaker says, how some ‚VR ‏cards works.‾  and you could ask: aa ‹How ’do the particular †deck works?.   b •How works ‰your deck? I.E: how is your deck of cards? or how does your particular deck work. And the answer is†※‗‴‸‵‶ ‼‐?a) a ″card game″b) the deck itself
Another example is this: I have a collection ‑of ›card games‒ (meaning ‌a set of"
965,What Is A Disposable Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: What Is A Disposable Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"In many words a ""Disposabel"" card may be better defined. It is something that is ""disposablenable"" and is not intended to be used again. Or a card that you can ""throw away"", like a disposable pen that will not write again and a one time use card is a better description. If there is any ambiguity, the first definition is most appropriate. The second is less appropriate since the virtual card can have multiple uses. So if you throw a virtual credit card away you may need to find another one.

The intent of the Disposeable Card
is that it is to act as a way for a user to ""get rid"" of a Virtual Credit Card. Once you use the card, you will never be able to charge the user back. Therefore it must be disposed of once a usage is complete. Some of these cards may have special charges for special services or activities, so it may not even be a charge back on it, it could be more of an extra charge, depending on what the Virtual card issuer offers. They may charge you a small fee, like $20 to $50 depending what service they offer in addition to the $10 or $15 charge of your virtual wallet credit limit. You could also be charged a monthly fee. But most likely you would be free to use as many as you want. There could even a a $1 fee to return the credit back to your wallet after you have used it (which will usually be the case). So your total cost will be between $9 and $100 depending. (If that does not make sense read the ""What is A Virtual Wallet"" section below.)
In most cases the charges would apply if the transaction were made for you rather that being your responsibility. However some Virtual wallets charge a per month fee for use and some charge fees monthly for purchases made during that month. For example a Visa is often offered at a cost of around $0.50 per purchase, or as much as $3.00 per transaction or per item purchased (I have been charged as little as 50 cents per year, some are as high as 10 dollars a month). I could go on and on with a list of possible charges. This will vary from one Virtual wallet to another. I suggest you read their fees and terms first and ask questions before using a particular Virtual credit cards. Then you should be well informed"

will be OK, please send the message. Thanks!
Please understand I don't mean to offend you! I only want to know which way you would want it. This is not like any other virtual item. Because of this
reason, I'd like to give this temporary card a try. You should not be worried! You need it only once and then you are free to delete it!"
967,How Do The Disposable Cards Work?,Considering this utterance: How Do The Disposable Cards Work? What is the intent that best describes it?,"1- Is It A True Statement? 2- What Is The Truth? (A.A) - True. 3- Why Is This Important? The statement is true. In fact, the more truth you can uncover the better you are in your quest.
- The truth is important because it brings you to the real purpose of your life; to know the Truth. That means that, if you get what is not true as you believed, you will end in failure. (see 1st step).
What this statement says about the card: You want the truth to come out. Truth will set you free. You are being honest about what happened. Your intention is to get to your truth - not to hide anything. This is your time to be totally honest. It is time for the past to become an example to you. Don't be afraid of anything that was true then, but not now. The more you talk about something that happened or not happening, there is always a possibility of it happening again. For it does happen again and again, especially with what we know and believe. If we hide the old, we have to do the same with the new - so the cycle continues. But if we admit it, it is like an open door to healing. By talking openly, your relationship with it becomes more constructive. And you have the right to talk to anyone about it. - If you feel that you may not be able to handle something, talk it out with your friends, or a therapist. We must be honest with ourselves and others. Otherwise we cannot expect to grow or to heal."
968,How Do I Use A Disposable Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Use A Disposable Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I am not sure about ""intent"". Perhaps a different word, like ""meaning""? Here, I'm talking about understanding and communicating one's intent, not meaning in general. For example, someone could say ""How do I use a disposable razor?""
""A disposable"" doesn't tell you how someone should use the razor, but simply what it is for (or, to be more general, what sort of thing it's for).
It seems to me that ""how"" (how to use something) is more appropriate. However, the phrase ""the disposable card"" seems awkward.
What do you think? I'd like a better way to describe the concept, without the word ""intended"". Does this mean that we have to choose either ""What is it like to (a disposable virtual card)? Is there another word? (e.g., ""what is its purpose"")
Thanks!
Note: this is different from a similar question, although some of the answers may apply. 
How to explain an idea to someone who has not seen it before
Related:  How to say that one can use virtual machines without owning them?, which asks how to express it more technically. Although, that was answered with some general terms, so my guess is that it was too generic. (The answer was ""a virtual machine"" or ""VMware or virtualization technology"".)
For the record, ""The disposable is like using a virtual"" is not the best way for me to convey this concept. I prefer more of a contrast between using something ""disposible"" versus using it ""non-disponible"". E.G., I could use:
A non-reusable or non recyclable disposable or disposable item is intended to not be usable or reusable. A recycable or recycles item can be used multiple times. Note that the item may not necessarily be designed for that. E,G, a cup is disposable; paper cups are reusable (but the idea was to make paper more environmentally friendly). If something is a non reusable product, then it must be able to function for a limited amount of time, even if it can't be reused (i,e, an item that could be re-sold for parts). A disposable plastic cup can function indefinitely as long as it isn't being used for liquids. So, it may"

970,Can You Explain The Disposable Cards To Me?,Considering this utterance: Can You Explain The Disposable Cards To Me? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What do you think it refers to?

What is meant by ""The Disjointed Cards""?
Which are the three cards, or groups of cards that are disjoint in some way? Is there something else in between the first three, and the last two? Do you mean the group of all the cards numbered higher than ten (the ""disjunct"")? And the number ten in question? Or the ten cards with number higher then ten? In between these are a couple of groups that could fit too, I suppose.
Also, is this a question for English or Math SE, though I think English is preferred? Also, can I make such a list of disjunctions?  I mean, that's a word, too. ""There are three disjoined cards."" ""One disjoin is on my desk."" Etc."
971,"Is There Anyway, I Can Get A Disposable Virtual Card?","Considering this utterance: Is There Anyway, I Can Get A Disposable Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?","A.
Answering the question posed in the title.B. Showing the speaker the ways to get a card that is disposable and can be used and discarded without having to worry about getting charged for it.C. Offering advice that could help a friend find a way to buy a used-in-conveniently-for-the-speaker prepaid card without being charged the normal fee for buying one.1
I think this statement is meant to give the impression that no matter how bad a situation one is in, there are ways that he or she could get away with a certain behavior. I would say that the statement implies that a better way of doing something is available. In addition, it could give a person the sense that there is always a solution to whatever it is they are in a jam of. For example, the guy saying this could feel justified in not doing the right thing and not paying his taxes just because he has the money to do something else with. However, he could be told the truth about his financial situation and be able to figure out a different way that satisfies him. He could then pay his tax obligation.2
This statement can also be made by someone who is trying to convince another person of a particular point of view, which implies persuasion.3
In this case, what is being sold is a type of financial product that will help the customer. This statement gives the listener an opportunity to purchase something that would help him to better deal with the financial issue that prompted this question in order to help himself.4
To answer the person’s question: “Is there anyway, we can get…”, is there a product available to solve their problem. The product in this instance being a prepaid debit card with no late fees.5
The best answer would be to provide the solution for the situation that they face.6
It is most likely that this person is not going to be sold anything. Instead, they will be simply be given the information, in an attempt to put a stop to this type activity.7
What the author is attempting to sell is their time, their expertise and services.8
Since the purpose of this website is to offer a resource for people looking for answers to their questions, this author will probably have a business plan that has to make money in some way.9"
972,I Just Purchased A Disposable Virtual Card. Am I Able To Use It For Online Purchases Immediately?,Considering this utterance: I Just Purchased A Disposable Virtual Card. Am I Able To Use It For Online Purchases Immediately? What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:
It was the first question I was asked when I applied for a virtual card. The answer is, of course, that you have no guarantee that the company that gave you money will provide it to you. If all the money goes to the banks you need to make the actual purchase. There are no guarantees. So if you want to use it for online purchases then you will need a method of transferring funds to your account first so that your funds are available to spend. This may be via a credit card or debit card that will be charged for the transaction but that is another question.
You will however get free money from the virtual cards in the sense that they will allow you to buy items that may or may not be of any use to a buyer. Sometimes these are free gifts for example you may get points that can be put into your virtual wallet. It also provides them with another channel for marketing to someone that has already expressed an interest in their service."
973,How Secure Is A Disposable Virtual Card,Considering this utterance: How Secure Is A Disposable Virtual Card What is the intent that best describes it?,"What does the speaker believe is his position in relation to this question? Who is he addressing? The question is an objective inquiry into an individual’s knowledge about the world. As such it is not a question, but rather a statement.

The subject of knowledge is often debated, especially by people interested in the philosophy of science. However, it seems, the most common question to come before the philosophic eye is: What do you know?
If a person has a good understanding of the natural world, he or she should possess some understanding and appreciation of what he/she does not know. A person who does “not know” is a normal person, not some strange, un-normal ‘scientist‘. The term,“scientists‚„ does have a negative connotation that, although, may not be the case for many scientists, can be misleading as there are many types and classes of scientists; one of which might be a philosopher, who is, by definition, a scientist. In the philosophical tradition of natural knowledge it was the Stoics who gave the term „scientia‟ (‫‪knowledge‬‭) a broader meaning; it can encompass the whole domain of inquiry in philosophy, and not just ’scientific‛ inquiry. This is evident in Marcus Aurelius Meditations, where he refers to philosophers as scientists of their own soul, ‪scientias nostras  (‹‮∆ÇΣ‣∂Φ ‭∈›Ω‡: ∆‰, σ ∏‥).
In this vein of thinking, I can understand that you would see the question of ”What do I know and what do not I‌ know?‏ ‏∗ ‹∞ ‬∟ ‣ ‐ ‮‸∫ as a philosophical question. But a real world scientist is unlikely to have the luxury of asking this. Rather, they would be asked to describe their work. That is how they should approach questions like: ″What are you doing? How do your experiments work? Are you able to explain what you are doing, how you came to what conclusions you have reached, etc? ‫ ‟What is your evidence for your"
974,What Do I Do To Get A Disposable Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: What Do I Do To Get A Disposable Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"It is a statement that describes a situation and what you think you need to do to get some relief from that situation. It can also be described as a declaration of intent. To make sure that what I'm suggesting here makes sense, I'll break down the sentences into their basic parts.

What: a description of a specific object. You have the idea in your head which can be expressed on paper but the words need a bit of work. For example, a car could be a thing which you want to have. Or you could describe the object with respect to some kind of function. If your car is broken, it's about getting another car. So you're describing the problem, you don't care about fixing it, just as if you've lost the key to your house, all you care is to find it. In the same vein, ""I need the Internet"" isn't really a problem statement until you have an Internet connection. Then it would be something like ""The Internet is not working"" in that you are having problems with it and don’t know how to fix it without an external source. This is where the second step comes in. ""To get a card"" is describing your intent to acquire it with no other intention and so a virtual card is something you'd use just to access the virtual machine you run your site on. The card could have a number which is tied to the user. When I enter ""jdoe@example.com"" into a mail client, the email address shows ""example@exmaple.ca"", because the domain name (example) is what's called a sub-domain of my name. That would work with the name of the machine, for example a site which displays my address. But that's not how it works here. I have multiple virtual machines and each of them has a unique virtual ID, like a name that is unique for that machine. There is no mail server on those machines. My mail is stored on a central server and there is usually a list which associates the mail address with this name or some unique number, so when I try to enter jd@12345.example it is associated with a mailbox on the server. All of this is automated and the mailbox can store a great deal of email. (And so far I am just talking about email, but I expect that this may change"
975,I Want To Get A Disposable Virtual Card.,Considering this utterance: I Want To Get A Disposable Virtual Card. What is the intent that best describes it?,"If you say: He wants to get a disposable virtual card, it is a statement of intent. If you were asking a simple question, such as: Where should we get the cards?, then that would better express the true intention.
To answer a question is to make it clear what you are asking. 
A statement can be used in different situations to mean something, but is normally used to state a condition, a desire and not so much a request or an order. It is used for expressing a state of mind (I want) or for making a declaration (It is raining) etc."
976,Can You Explain Disposable Cards?,Considering this utterance: Can You Explain Disposable Cards? What is the intent that best describes it?,"It was a very simple and easy sentence which only has one clause; yet I got confused and didn’t know how to choose the right word.
I‘m sure you can understand my feelings after having been confused for more than ten minutes. Let me help you to understand and to find a better answer. This will give you a clear insight into your writing ability. If you want to become a good writer you need to be aware of your own writing level and style because this is very useful for further improvements. You may read more about how I was confused. I don„ı°t believe that writing is an art or something like that; however, it has to do with the process of thinking. When you are writing, you don't have to use complex sentences and words but, if you try to think, what you mean to communicate with your readers, then you will definitely be able to express your thoughts more effectively. In this post, I will show you how we can think about our writing and I‟ı®ll explain to you what happened with me. It is a simple example, however there are more complex ones too! Please note that this example is written in a fictional situation. Your thoughts are different from mine. However, your thought process probably will be the same as what I described. Here is what we mean when we use the word “thinking”. Please keep in mind that, when you use this word, think in the context of the whole sentence or paragraph which you have written. A thought can be expressed in simple sentences or in more complicated sentences too. The way the language is constructed, the use of various words, and the order of sentences can greatly affect this. There are many ways to convey certain meanings through language. Each of those ways has its own pros and cons. So, do not get carried away with words and start to get excited about the perfect use and usage of words. Do not try and create a perfect sentence in your first attempt; rather take what is meaningful that you think. Don‰ıt worry about grammar. For example if it doesn‚ıı™t look like a correct sentence, don'ı“ı´ı¯ı€ıíı±ı§ı«ı¬ı·ı¢ı©ıïı½ı», this does not mean that a bad sentence is"
977,How Do I Get A Virtual Card For One Time Use,Considering this utterance: How Do I Get A Virtual Card For One Time Use What is the intent that best describes it?,"If you said ‘I want to make a phone call to my friend.’ The virtual card would then be the card associated with your number.
You then use the virtual SIM card like you would a physical phone card. There are also SIM cards that you can buy online, for a very reasonable price. If you do that, they usually provide the software you need to create the account. You also do not need a SIM from this provider. The SIM would be a virtual one from the cloud. However, you will have to pay for the service. But there are very cheap ones available. A virtual provider will allow you to send emails. So you could use that to register for your free account, and then pay to subscribe using your virtual credit. This is what I would recommend doing. Then you simply login to your account whenever you want a ’phone‘."
978,May I Get A Disposable Virtual Card As Well?,Considering this utterance: May I Get A Disposable Virtual Card As Well? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The first thing that comes to mind with this expression is an offer that is extended in the form of a gift. That is a very appropriate reaction.

As it is used to describe an act, it can also be described as an opportunity. An opportunity of course comes with some responsibility. When used as a verb, this type of act is also referred to as ""giving away"".
What do you want to achieve? What exactly makes you ask this question? You might want your company to get a better reputation or for a particular event to be remembered forever. Or you might be interested in a certain company or product being mentioned in this context. You may be looking for feedback, suggestions or a recommendation. Whatever the case, you need to make a clear statement to the reader about your objective. The following examples demonstrate how you can achieve your desired goal. I Want To Get a Dispose Virtual Visa Card. A company wants a customer to use their company's product or service. They could offer a sample or voucher. If your goal is to increase your customer base, then you could send out a free eNewsletter. To make your message a bit more compelling, add an incentive or offer an exclusive to those who register. Giveaways that use a social media element are very effective. How about this: I'm Giving Away $50 In VISA Credit! This offers money to a person as well as recognition on a website. It is free advertising for your website and company. In this case the $10 value of the card is worth more than the money value. Who knows, with viral marketing you may get your $40 worth for nothing!
May I be given a chance to win $20,000 In cash, free gas and a new computer. This is one of my favorite ways to give away money. Many people feel bad when they give money away because they don't know where it will go. Well, if it's going towards the acquisition of more money, they should feel good knowing that their gift will have a positive effect on the economy. And who knows what they may win. Maybe it was someone else who needed the gift you were willing to part with. There are plenty of people out there who have no idea how they were born or how fortunate they are. As you know your gift won't necessarily affect them directly. But it could make them aware of their situation and how others"
979,Can I Get A Single Use Virtual Card,Considering this utterance: Can I Get A Single Use Virtual Card What is the intent that best describes it?,"Can the speaker mean that he or she can borrow a single use virtual card in case the physical card is lost for any reason? Or can it mean a virtual account? What if the card or account is no longer useful or needed by the user? It can mean neither of those things. It is possible to interpret “I need a one-time-use card for this trip” as meaning ‘a physical one time use card, not a non-physical one;’ which is why most of these phrases aren‘t usually grammatically incorrect even though they can be taken as slang or even sarcasm in some cases. There is also a slight change in the meaning when the phrase is spoken out loud. For example, ”Can I borrow your card?“ is probably interpreted as ‚Hey friend, can I take your physical debit or credit card with me on this shopping trip? That is just because it sounds natural. We would never ask that when we are not going on a shopping or some other outing.

„
The phrase ""Can you get me a visa?"", with all possible interpretations of the sentence being given, is gramatically correct, as the verb in that sentence is „get‟ not †‰"" ’ ""can"": the question form of ‰‹. The correct meaning in this example is: ‡Can‴ you ′´get´ me ‵´a´ visa?. If one is given a different interpretation in mind, then it is not grammatical. This is because the subject is singular and the singular conjugation of get means that the pronoun can only be one thing, i.e., a noun, in plural. Hence the usage of a, an in front of them for the plural form. You may have noticed this in other English sentences before this:‏
Example: I know a girl who looks exactly like her.‚‡› I can  ‏get ‬ me one of my old friends. I  want  ‹you‱ to‌ ‪write  me‬  ‭a  note‫ ‭saying  ‑‒ ‖I‮‥know ′†someone․ ‪with‧ ‍the�"

What is the intent that best describes it?,"In the case of this example, the best answer is Intent to Purchase; because this is a request to get the user some sort of physical credit or debit card, and the merchant can only offer to provide the information to someone who has already been identified to be a customer that he or she already has a relationship with and has bought from before in the past (a.k.a: the purchase is on a ""credit"" card).
The answer may be different if the conversation is around a gift card or if it's a conversation with a person that wants a virtual card (i.e. the person is new to the organization and doesn't yet have a known credit/debit account)."

If I remember right, the answer is that intent is ""What to do with the card"". The utterances are not in a conversational style, and that might have something to say about the intended meaning.
I haven't read this question before, but I believe that in the following utterations, ""card"" is not a common collocation, which can give a hint to the meaning as well: ""I have a card with..."" or ""It's my card, so..."", or even ""This is a gift card and...""."
982,How Does A Virtual Card Work,Considering this utterance: How Does A Virtual Card Work What is the intent that best describes it?,"Does it mean ""virtual card"" as the noun, or ""card"" is used as an adjective?

The first interpretation can be supported by looking at the sentence structure. The sentence would make more sense if you read it as ""How does the virtual card work?"" and the answer is that it's like a normal card, but it is virtualized and doesn't have to be printed.
Here are a few sentences which are similar. Is this the intended meaning? I'm trying to see what they have in common. I've bolded the verbs used to represent my question. How do you think the sentences best illustrate the meaning (as well as which one is more specific to the topic?)
How do I make a sandwich? (I could do it, I just need to buy the ingredients)
You have a phone? No, my phone isn't here, it has to go to repair. (My phone needs repair) 
I would like to borrow $100? That's a lot of money. It's much better to save money! (The amount is a little too big for me. A friend can help me, and I could save the money.)
If I want to have more of an A, how do the two cards work together? If we use the example of having a higher A and a lower A together, would the cards just work as you'd expect in that sentence?"

As you already know, the card is issued by a third-party company, so we can not do so in any way.
However, if we go to the website, or click on the banner, and click the download link, then we will be able to install. If you do this, you will see a pop up, in which there will appear an instruction, like a guide. The process of downloading the app from the Google Play Store and installing it. Then, when it is open, just choose “Install”, ”Install and run“, enter the code received, click Next and install the application successfully.

What is the intent that best describes it?,"For example:  If I have a card to pay $10 for food and that card runs out in the middle of the meal - What happens? Does the card not work and it has to be thrown out?

A:
(1) A disposable credit card allows the vendor to have an unlimited amount of transactions on their credit meter at any one time. If the disposable card is used to make a purchase in excess of $50, it will be returned with a credit to the account holder's credit line. The card holder will pay the remaining amount, minus a charge of 3% for credit.  - The ""disposability"" is defined by the manufacturer.
The vendor is allowed a maximum transaction amount that is pre-set by a vendor's bank or by Visa/MC. This will not be exceeded. They can then ""return"" the unused transaction by charging back. A card that does this will have the following information: -
VIRUS
DISPOSABLE CARD
PRE-PAID
CREDIT CARD #
TRANSACTION COUNT
CARD TYPE  (e.g. MC, VISA, AMEX etc.)
MAXIMUM AMOUNT (USD)
MINIMUUM BID (US$)  The minimum bid is usually $25-50 depending on the market. -  For a preauthorized ""buy now, pay later"" type card: The maximum is based on your credit limit. When you are ready to use the credit, you can call to place a lower bid - but you have to call. There is no set time limit to do this. It's based upon when you call the bank/processor to activate the buy now payment plan. As long as you don't call, they won't activate your card. For all others: There's no cap. You can spend as much as the maximum allowed and still keep your current card (VISA/Mastercard).
To activate a new card, the merchant must give the customer a code from their phone to verify your identity. That code can be printed on a piece of paper, in writing, etc. But it must be a unique code that the seller must have. Usually this code is printed in plain view.

What is the intent that best describes it?,"What can one do if there are no more options left? This can be a real problem if you really don’t want to deal with the situation. In such cases, one of the best ways to find a solution is to ask a lot of questions. There are people who find ways around the problem. Here, it is possible to buy the cheapest disposable virtual card. It is not really cheap but if the price is so much higher to afford it, you can always look for an alternative. This might be one such solution. These cards will not last forever so it will be useful to make sure that everything works well. You can easily look and get the most suitable one that fits your needs.

987,How Do I Obtain A Disposable Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Obtain A Disposable Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"(check the best answers).

What does ""obtain"" mean?
How does it help to think of the word ""virtual"" (as in the sentence) in this context? What does the virtual in virtual card really have to do with the actual act of obtaining a ""disposible virtual""? (This question is asking for the meaning of virtual.)
Does ""card"" here have anything to to with ""to obtain""?
I am asking if we could replace any of these 3 questions with another word or phrase to better express the concept that is being explored.
In summary - is it valid to ask about the real meaning or use of one word in a sentence or paragraph without the context of a whole paragraph, sentence, or word? I am not sure if this question was a duplicate or a new question. It seems to be on topic, but I don't feel like I know enough for this. 
Thanks

EDIT
After reading some great answers, and seeing the comments on this one as well, I would like to clarify what I was really looking for by posting this new (I believe) question on Meta. This one was originally asking about how to obtain the correct meaning in ""Disposables are an effective way to manage your virtual resources. ""  I'm still not really sure that this is clear. As a reader, is this sentence still clear now?   Is it still unclear? This is still a question of word choice. How should we ask the question? Should we just ask this: ""How do I obtain a virtual"" without context in every sentence? We can't really know until we hear from someone. We could ask more questions to try and better understand. Should I ask a second (or third) time: Does this work:
""How Do The Words ""Obtain (and obtainable) Virtuals Work?"" or  ""Do Disposalable and Obtaining Virtual Resources Work As One Thing Or As Two? Or Are they Two Words For One Meaning? ""
This one is a slightly better question because I have some context from one of my own comments to see what they mean by disposables and obtaining virtuals. I just don’t think that I can make it totally clear without knowing the whole sentence. Also, this would be more related to grammar (which I believe this site is for) instead"
988,How Would You Use A Disposable Card?,Considering this utterance: How Would You Use A Disposable Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Does it refer to a method of disposing something? or a product? If it is a

be: “Let’s do this. Dispose this in this way.”? The activity or object is
disposed of in a particular way? How? (a particular kind)
What kind would be the first thing we would try
to dispose this with? For example, would it use a trash can or
dumpster? It would probably be with something
we‘d try to dispose of our trash. Would the item used be
an object or item we have to buy? We would use it to
try to put our stuff in? Perhaps we throw it in with
a box of trash to be picked up. Perhaps there‚s a place
for it we could drop it off. Or, it could be a box, cart or container we use
when we put something in our car to transport to or from work or home. It might be part of a tool we‡re using or have
something we try use to use this tool or dispose
of something we are using. Maybe we drop this into a garbage
can or trash bin. The word could also refer
if it was to try and dispose a problem, issue, or something else that
needs to go away or be resolved. We might try this
in an attempt to resolve some sort of situation. For
example:
Disposing something can also be to have a process

mean doing this to an item or problem instead of
having a container or device we can toss this item
into or to. Could the ‘item‖ be something specific? Maybe a paper? A computer? Something from a phone or an appliance? Then it would not be in general. How
would one dispose something with a disposable

In the book, The Road Less Traveled, the father in the novel describes the process of understanding what he has to let go.
""The mind is a very peculiar organ,"" (p. 13) he wrote. ""It takes things for granted. Like a child, it does not question, and is not capable of questioning, what is presented to it. We never question anything we accept as fact, or even a part of our experience. If we are told that it is raining on the other side of a window we do not think of the rain; it may be that we have never observed rain on any side, but we know there is no rain inside the house, for example, therefore there can be no other place in which it could be raining. As long as we see no proof of it, we must assume it.""
(The Road less Traveleds, p. 16)
He continued, ""When you begin to question what you think is truth, then the mind becomes very active indeed. It is like a field that is being ploughed up by the plow. New thoughts come up, questions arise and your mind starts looking about for answers. You begin wondering, wondering and wondering. Your curiosity is aroused."" (pp.16-17).
This is similar to the concept of inquiry that I use in my classes. An inquiry is an open-ended, focused, self-initiated process where the focus is on a specific question that you want to answer. The key to inquiry, like the key for understanding and experiencing freedom, is to start. A student once said, in talking about inquiry in class:
'I always felt like I had to learn how everything worked, before I could figure out how that worked."" I felt that way, until I learned how how I was thinking, feeling, acting and relating.'
So, to begin an inquiry we first need to know what we want the answer to be, so we make a statement of intent. And then, by asking the question: What next? we get clear about the next thing that needs to happen. By doing this, not only do we find the ""truth"" of what the universe offers but, more importantly, learn the lesson to live the kind of life that allows us to find this truth. This is true inquiry"

Hi,
You can get virtual cards. They have a $1,000 minimum. You get up to $10,0000/yr in credit, they can charge you interest, but you must pay that off in full every month.
They can be used online, or in stores. If you pay it off and it's expired, you can use it again. And you'll get new cards every 30 days, so there's no need for re-activation. http://www.creditcardgift.net
I have several gift cards that give me $30, $50, and $75/mo. I love them. But if you just pay off what you owe each month, then you are not wasting their money. It's the best way to be a good customer. When you buy something, that's your money being wasted. So, paying off your debt is a great way for you to save their $. This is one of the most important reasons to do it. Another good reason would be to show them that you really appreciate their business. In fact, the better you treat them, in my opinion, usually, (they won't"
994,Hello! I Need To Order A Disposable Virtual Card. Where Can I Do That At?,Considering this utterance: Hello! I Need To Order A Disposable Virtual Card. Where Can I Do That At? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What information are you trying to give us about the utterances purpose here? Is it to provide a description, request information, give a warning, or simply state your order?

The intent of an utterable could be very important, because in that case, it will be up to the interpreter to decide the most useful interpretation, and to select the suitable answer (if available) or the appropriate action for your request depending on what information you are trying communicate.
To better understand how to identify the primary intent behind an Utterance, we'll have a quick look into the common types of utterables. In the process, you'll be able to understand the different types and how they help you determine the correct understanding of your utterant.


**1st Ut:   Hello I need to order a disposable virtual card. 
  Where can I do that at? **

Intent: Request Information 

 - What kind of Information are they looking for?  -
- Is this a generic statement, asking for a product or service? -  no

##1.2 Intention
In speech, the Intent is usually expressed by the speaker or in other words, what the hearer/observer thinks the communicator wants (the primary) purpose to do, is (secondary) purposes. When the listener understands the intention of the Communicator, then he/she can interpret the communication correctly (and efficiently), so he can select/use the best appropriate answer, action, decision, product, service, etc. It's a basic concept in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and is a necessary requirement in communication between humans (e. g. in the case of HCI, a communicative task"
995,Where Do I Request A Disposable Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Where Do I Request A Disposable Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This utterances can also be classified into two types:
- a declarative
and
a request.
To make this classification clearer, we propose two additional categories: a directive and an order. To better illustrate our ideas, let us look at the following dialogue:. In this dialogue, the question we are interested in is: “Where does the user want to buy a disposable debit (virtual or physical) card?”. The question can be divided into the request and the directive: where is she requesting the bank to offer such an alternative? We can add the other parts of the utternance (as in the example) in addition to the main elements to better describe an utterrance’s semantic type (directive/request).
The same can apply to any speech. Any given utterence can have more than one classification based on its meaning/intent. For example, in this article. Here, you can classify any utternce depending on: what is its main purpose, what can it be about, who is it directed to (e.g. is this about a company or a user) and if the message is a request, a confirmation and a warning. Each classifier will help you to understand this new type of data better than before, but we hope this gives you the idea and we‘ll see how to use the information you‚e getting in a following part of this series of articles."

What is the intent that best describes it?","I'm having some trouble with a particular passage. Specifically: The sentence begins with ""I would like to exchange currencies"" but I would argue that the sentence as a whole is meant to be: ""If there was an extra charge to do so"".
What I think is being expressed here is that I am saying that a change of currency (if it can be done) would be something I don't currently have the resources (or I'm unaware of them) to make happen. However, I could potentially do this if there is an additional charge or some kind of fee to doing so.
It feels like it is saying this, but there's something that is missing from this meaning I feel like I want. Can anyone help me with this?  

A:
There is a word missing in your sentence. The missing word is ""However"". In order to change currencies it should be "" However it requires an ""Extra charge""."

A market for exchange of currency can exist between countries, among nations and even at the same time within a single country. At the moment, currencies are issued by governments and the currencies of each country are managed in the interest of th
e country's own citizen. However, the management and control is delegated to central banks and currency boards, a form of government-regulated private financial institution. Although most people in other countries do not hold any other currency than their home country curr
ency, it is possible to have an international financial system. One example is when a country sells bonds, known more commonly as debt instruments, to borrow money to invest in infrastructure such a roads, water projects that benefit all the people (not just a few) in another country, e.g. in India. Such a
bond, however, is an instrument issued in an ""exchange"" form and is called currency. Currency is considered as the ""money"" and bonds or government bonds of any country can serve as currency for another nation. Another example of a ""currency"" is US currency, that is used in America for any transactions,

1000,Is There A Fee For Using A European Bank Card To Top Up?,Considering this utterance: Is There A Fee For Using A European Bank Card To Top Up? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I am writing you to ask for your help in understanding a specific sentence.
The one that says ""Is there a fee for using a Euro-Bank card (such as a MasterCard, Visa or Maestro) to top up?.""
As far as I know, it could be used in two ways:
A. To ask about a charge
B. to talk about an action
In order to make a choice about which one is used, I am referring to an example which was provided in the previous thread: ""I'm planning to buy a coffee in a shop where I normally get charged €0.10 for a drink. I have a credit card with €15 on it. If there is one, what's he charge for my coffee?”
Now the answer to my example was that you will probably be charged the same as in other shops, so there was no fee. Which is correct (A) or (B)?
What does the use of the word “fee’ imply? Is it an act, or the result of an event? 
Is it about the intention of someone or something? (In this case, about how someone will charge you.)   OR is it a statement about what actually happens? Which one do you think fits best? And which of them would you say you know about when you hear this sentence? Thanks in advance for any clarification.  Thanking you in anticipation...
P.S.: the ""fee"" is in singular, not plural (which is also my case with the rest of that sentence).
Edit: I would like to add a clarification about your previous answer. You write that:  ""The answer given to the question in its original form (ie, there are no charges for the service) indicates that it's not a question about intent"". That's right. The person asking the sentence in question wants to say, ‘I plan to go somewhere and use my card to get €100. They would never charge me a single penny. And I want to know how much they are going to charge to use it‘. But that person has been informed that using bank cards to pay (with the help of a cashback system) will not affect his costs. This is why he is asking for an indication about it, rather than his own opinion or assumption about"
1001,Are There Any Fees For Adding Money With An International Card?,Considering this utterance: Are There Any Fees For Adding Money With An International Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The word ""fees"" implies the person is being told about something that is going to be charged. Or is it asking the question: ""Are there any fees when I add money to this account?"" If the latter, it would imply that something is free when money is added, so the answer here is: no, there are not any added/hidden fees associated with adding money.

What is The Word For This Intent?
I am trying to look up this word for a project and keep hitting brick walls. The closest I can come to is ""no charges"" but I just don't feel that's accurate. There is a charge associated when you add the funds, you are getting charged by the card (credit/debit) or by bank. I am using the definitions in the dictionary as guidelines. Is this a good word? Are there better words to use? Thanks
Note: I have read a few forums where similar words have been used, but all of those refer to charges. In that case, the usage is referring to ""charges"" for ""transactions"" (purchases, withdraws, etc).
UPDATE: This is not a duplicate. While it does ask the same question, this question differs because it is asking about the charge that comes on the debit or credit card, not about a transaction. Also, if the word is correct, then the example sentence in this thread is incorrect. Thanks. 
Edit: The intent was to find a word that was synonymous or an alternative to fee but that did not carry the connotation of charges/transaction charges and was not misleading. That's what I was going for. Sorry for the confusion. It seems I didn't do a very good job of explaining. For the people who marked the duplicate, that thread was looking for words that conveyed the idea that there was a fee or cost to do something. This question doesn't seem to fit that. My apologies for any further confusion and for wasting time trying. To those in favor of marking this as a dupe/off-topic: Please explain your reasoning, and don’t mark this until you can show a link to another Q&A about this same idea. Thank you. :)
The closest example (that I could find) would be ""No charges for transactions"". That was the best I found. However, I want to clarify"

(I just did, with a link; I'll let you answer it in the event that you wish to.) As for ""will there be a charge for top-offing a debit/ATM card"", I suspect that will be the case. I don't know if they'll charge per card, per transaction, or what, but I doubt you'll want one of those. ""Tipping off"" a credit card in an ATM (assuming one uses the term ""tipping"" to mean ""adding an amount that is more than the minimum"") is usually a one-time, ""free"" process, so no charges. Tipping is different for debit cards, as ATM withdrawals are usually done with an ""automatic"" PIN and a few other options (depending on the machine; the usual one will do both PINs and PIN+TIN, which is just PIN, plus a ""temporary"" credit for that PIN's amount. But there are also ATMs that require you to input the PIN yourself, then do another ""automated"" TIN to do the automatic PIN. In either case, the TIP is ""in"" the amount to which it is added (in an automated ATM, a TAN amount is put on an AT1 or ""receipt"" at the end of each transaction (which, by the way, is why you are charged even when you use the ""cash back"" option; it's just a way of charging you for each of what is done at one ATM), but a manual ATM can give you either way), not on top of or in addition to the"

EDIT:  I believe it is saying that there are ""charges"" for topping up a card and I need to specify whether it makes sense by putting some kind of ""OR"" in the sentence or not?  Thanks again..
This is what I got so far: ""If, you do not make any of the payments on your credit card, there will be charges on the outstanding balance.""
Or this:
""If you top up your charge card without paying for it, the credit company may charge you an additional amount, which may be in addition to the charge on which you are currently paying.""  .

1006,Are There Fees For Top Ups?,Considering this utterance: Are There Fees For Top Ups? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This is one of the questions which is asked by our clients on a regular basis, while filling their car insurance quotes. You would not be surprised if you found it in our site. It is indeed an interesting question because most of people do not know what the answer to the question will be like.
As we all know that, there are two types of car insurers, namely, non-admitted and admitted car insurers. So, we will discuss in detail what is meant by “admission“ and how does it differ from non admission. Let’s find out…
What is Admissions? It‘s very important to know, the difference between a non admitted and an admitted auto insurance is that the non admitting insurers don”t have the authority to settle your claims directly, but they can do the process of claims settlement after the claims have been received. On the other hand, when it comes to an auto insurer that admits liability, you can go to their offices and file your claim directly with them and they would settle it on the same day of receiving your request. However, it is necessary for you to pay a certain amount of money as a proof of insurance for them. This is how a car insurer is said to be, ‘admitting‖. You can find many car repair shops who are willing to take your car as it will benefit them as well. The insurance that is provided to you will cover the expenses of repairing and replacing your damaged goods. In other words, an insured is responsible for the damage or loss of his vehicle even when he is not driving. If you are a driver, then you need to have your own car. And, if the vehicle gets damaged or destroyed then, this can affect your personal lives and you may have to incur huge expenses for repairing. But, having no personal insurance, would be a very risky decision that you‟d be taking. To overcome this risk, a lot of auto insurers are there and it would prove to act as an added advantage for both you and them by providing you with a reliable coverage. Insurance companies know the risks that a particular car represents, so it always makes sense for an insurer to charge a bit extra on their insurance rates. By doing so, their risk is reduced. Most people don't realize that car owners are paying more and more for insurance. Your insurer will always want you covered"
1007,What Are The Charges For Us Cards With Top Up.,Considering this utterance: What Are The Charges For Us Cards With Top Up. What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is your answer: the charge for using your card as a top up card.
That is correct. Your answer is a paraphrase of the following: When I use my card at the cash machine. The reason is that this sentence has the same main verb and the main sentence subject. It also has a direct object that has been removed. This direct and most likely most important grammatical object is your wallet. Therefore, this is incorrect. When you use your credit card, it will be for you to pay the bill you already are in arrears on when the payment due date arrives. In the next question, your paraphrasing sentence that you answered: ""the charge of using a card"" or ""for us to use a cards"" is wrong. There will not be ""a charge"" as it is not about a charge. To paraphrise your sentence correctly, you will have to find an appropriate verb, subject and direct to put in its place. Try: We have a limit of how much we can top-up from our card (withdraw). That statement is more grammatically correct as, in it there is no need to paraphase your original sentence, therefore no paraphrising required. You could simply say: we have some limit on how we topup with our credit cards. We may have limit, such as 10, 15 or 20. For us cards are more common. They were designed for when someone was in need of a quick cash injection. But the credit can be used to purchase things, as well as topups. If you can use money that is already in your account to make some purchases, why can't you top it up? For example, the cost of your groceries or any other transaction. Why would you need money to buy something? There is nothing wrong with your grammar. However, there are many ways you could say it. Perhaps a better way to top that sentence up would be: How much can I top the money from my credit/debit card? I have never been charged any more for my debit card than for our cards for top ups. I will often go to the store and not top off my cards if I don't need any money. That is because I am not charged anything for the service. Just the actual cash out. Also, I can usually get more money with my regular checking account (where I deposit my salary and my"

This is a question about how to use credit cards, and I think that this question is about credit as much as it is shopping. There are two questions here: How much should I charge for goods and services if I am charging my card over its limit? And: Do I get any special benefits if my credit card has a European Union symbol on it, or does this apply only to purchases in Europe? 
As far as I know, there are few (or, as far I can tell, no) additional charges to top up a credit (i.e. not debit) card from a different card network. For instance, I use my American Express to pay with my VISA card. As far a I understand, when you use a card to charge, the merchant has no way of determining which card is used to make the payment, so you can usually top your card up without any additional ""fee"" for it. In addition, if you have the ""credit"" option turned off on your debit card, you do not get the benefits that American's and other card networks offer if your credit limit is reached (which might include, in the case of American, interest-free purchases)."
1009,In Exchange For Top Ups Will You Take Fees?,Considering this utterance: In Exchange For Top Ups Will You Take Fees? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Does the question assume some kind of exchange, which may or may not be the one for which it was intended? If that is so, the assumption that there will be some exchange may need a different question. 
To make a clear distinction between that question's intent and what it intends to ask, we might say:

In Exchanging a Top Up Will you charge your recipient a fee?
  The question is whether the user will charge a transaction fee for top ups? This is different from the above question, whose intent was to inquire about charges.
The above is also different to:   In Exchange Of What Will YOU Take? which might be asking something similar to ""How much would you take for this?"".
What the second question intends is to get a price for the value of what you will exchange. That is probably not what the poster wants to know, and the fact that they are trying to use the word 'exchange' as the basis of a value suggests they might not have any good understanding of the topic at all, or might only be able to offer some sort of vague value judgement."
1010,I Just Topped Off My Card Will I Be Charged For It?,Considering this utterance: I Just Topped Off My Card Will I Be Charged For It? What is the intent that best describes it?,"This utterances is a perfect example of the use of collaision. The speaker intends to use collision because he or she is trying to create confusion and to make the listener question the meaning of it and the speakers intent is to mislead.

Consider this: You've Got Mail. Can you give it's colligation? I believe the speaker is attempting to convey the words: ""I will give you what you deserve"" because the letters are arranged in a way to give a pun or play on words. So, you got mail means ""to receive what I deserve"".
This is similar to I just topped off my card, it will I be charged for it?, I'm not sure of its actual colligatory meaning so I will try to describe it. I think the colligaion here is ""will"" and ""you're"". We can say: you're topped off your card so you'll be billed. This makes complete sense because it gives the impression that you have already paid your bill which is true. In a similar way, with the utternce I was just topping off I can infer that the person was trying (not very successfully though) to say that he is not going to get any more money from his boss for this month. His boss has already given him his paycheck so he will not be getting any additional pay."
1011,How Much Does It Cost To Top Up By Card?,Considering this utterance: How Much Does It Cost To Top Up By Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"-
The speaker intends to convey that the amount is very large.
It can be seen in the phrase, it costs. -
You are right! - It's very much like the question
Is it expensive to live here? which also conveys that it is
a costly place to reside in. However this has the sense of
'I'd say...' with no specific quantification, and this makes
it a little less specific. It just says that there's a
lot of money involved, but it doesn't specify it. The
speaker could be saying that if you have to pay for a house,
your expenses will be very high. But this is much less
specific than 'I say,...' or the like. You might use
this when you're trying to convince someone of something, as
in 'It costs a lot more than that, actually'.
I think these kind of expressions can really be difficult to
analyse. Maybe they're the ones that make it easy to use in
conversations. Because if it's too complicated, you'd
probably not use it!
There's the difference between the two: - 'How much does it
cost to top up by card?', and 'Is what it cost you to be the President
of America so much money?'
Here, the first person is asking a general question, whereas
the second person's question is an expression of doubt. That's
because the 'general question' is more general than the
question that follows. We might think of it as a very
general kind question."

How I got started. I have always been a writer. A few years back, I took my writing to the next level and became a published author. That”s another blog for another day. Suffice it to say, my book, Life Is A Beach, was published last summer by Stitchery Publishing and was featured on the cover of a popular mom-to-mom magazine, Parenting Magazine. For those who have not followed, the book chronicles my journey of motherhood and what it means to be a parent. It“s a story about what happened while I was pregnant with my daughter (my first book) and how I became her mom. At the time of publication, we were expecting the arrival of my son any day now. So the timing was perfect. The theme was relevant. This book was just what the doctor ordered!
Now that the first baby is here, it took me three months, but it is time to publish a second book. As I said in the previous blog article, writing books is hard, so how can I find the motivation to write another one? My best guess is that my second son is my muse. And so, here goes: this is what happens when mom is a Beach. In the new book… Life… Is a…. Beach! Life….Is….A.....Beach. Mom…Is......A.......Beachy Mom! The second edition of this book will have a slightly different title, though I will publish an update at the end of the year when my third son makes his appearance. Stay tuned. Or, you could just read my first one, a freebie. (It‟s on sale in some countries for a discounted price).

1015,How Much Can I Expect To Pay To Top Up A Us Card?,Considering this utterance: How Much Can I Expect To Pay To Top Up A Us Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"How Much To Exceed The Us Balance

If we want to find how much to top-up a card, then that means to what extent or how far we expect the us balance to exceed. How far? That's the question.
Let's look at a few options:
Option 1: What would you charge for the service? The service could be a cash advance but we usually think of it as a line of credit. The idea is to take out an advance with a limit on the credit line, i.e., the amount of money that one can borrow and have available. If you don't pay back that advance plus interest then you owe a us credit card charge. In addition, you'll also need a loan fee. This is because you're loaning that us a sum of cash, and your credit limit (i.  
e, the maximum amount you can spend and carry over to the next statement) is usually lower than it would be if you were making a purchase or paying down a debt. And since the loan is a type of us charge, it will be subtracted from your us limit. A charge of this type would have a cost that would not exceed that amount. It's an interest-free way of charging an us loan, as there is no cost and the money is coming from you, not the bank. For most lines of business, one will want a credit of more than the cost of the top up. So to determine the extent that you'd like to go with this option, calculate the following
The maximum that the card can receive is called the available credit, or avl. We'll assume that it is $1000.00. That is, there's only $1,000. on line that will never be available for any transaction. Let's now add a $100. of topup cost. Now the line balance is: $1100
$1000 available
Add:$100 cost
Line now $1100
What is this $300. cost? This figure represents the interest that is charged on that line. At an annual rate of 4%, the $299. in interest charged equals approximately $9.95. (That's about what a typical us card will charge you).
In order to compare the options, let's first look
At how they will affect a balance. There are"

What is the intent that best describes it?,"Will I be charged if I use an ATM card for topping up my prepaid load? (Example: If your load reaches 20% and your prepaid credit gets exhausted, and you have an account with a balance of 100 euros and no more credit and the ATM bank account is connected, will the bank be willing to charge you for using the card, even though the amount that is deducted is only 20 euros?)
No. In general, prepaid loads do not incur fees, though certain types of cards may have different rules.
Prepaid credit cards
If you top up your credit card using an automated terminal, such as an atm machine, online, or on the telephone; the money added will be deducted from the current credit balance on your card. The card has no limit on how much you can add or take away. You are charged a transaction fee, but this cannot be avoided. (Note: if you buy goods or services using your ATM debit card or credit debit cards then you may be able to get a reduced price)
You are responsible to pay the fee. A fee will also be applied if the transaction exceeds the daily withdrawal limit for your account. If you wish to make a withdrawal at a cash point, then the usual rules apply. Please note that ATM cards do NOT have a daily limit so the fees on any withdrawals will not be applicable. 
ATM Bank/Debit cards (with no pre-authorisation limit)  : In order for the credit to be transferred from your Bank account to your Card, your bank would like an authorization to transfer the funds. Therefore, when you use the machine in the way shown, this authorization is given and therefore no charge is incurred when that amount is withdrawn from a Cashpoint/ATMs as long as you follow the steps below. When the charge comes through you will receive an email.

1021,Will I Be Charged For Topping Up By Card?,Considering this utterance: Will I Be Charged For Topping Up By Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"(Dictionary definition for Intent)
""The purpose one has in mind in undertaking an action, especially as revealed through one's speech or behavior.""
Intent is often considered an important factor in determining one’s culpability for an offence. A person who intends to commit a certain offence is guilty of it.
For example:
If a person intends stealing a wallet he is considered to be guilty if he does actually steal the wallet. 
Similarly, in law, if a defendant in a criminal charge has an intent to steal a bank account (in the example, he intended to rob the bank or he intends rob somebody's bank, but he has not actually stolen the account), his intent will be considered along with other important factors such as preparation and the use of a weapon, because stealing of an account is an ""armed"" offence under the Criminal Code (section 459).
Also, under Criminal law in the United States and Canada, intent is necessary for one to have committed a crime, as opposed to negligence or recklessness. Intent, however, can be inferred from certain circumstances (such as the type of firearm used in shooting a victim, whether the victim had an opportunity to avoid being shot, any statements made by the accused before or after the incident, etc.) but is not an element of every crime. For example the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Elonis v. United States (2014) [1] that ""the mere uttering of violent or otherwise provocative speech 'alone is [not] enough to demonstrate that a speaker harbors criminal intentions'; the speaker must also have used the words 'in such a manner and under such circumstances' that they reasonably could be interpreted by those who hear them as a threat."" In Canada this is known as criminal culpable negligence (see section 6 of the Criminal Code), and in India as criminal intent(see sections 109, 210 and 210A of Indian Penal Code). Criminal intent may be demonstrated under various circumstances, which include the following:

 Where a party acts so as to imply that he will not or will no longer do something. This is especially likely in such cases, when a man promises something, and then fails to perform it and is held to the promise made, although he may have had the power to make different and other promises. When a father promises, 'I shall"

If the statement is a ""why/how"" question:

How should the phrase be worded as to avoid a misinterpretation?   For example:

This is a common problem for people who have an idea in the back of their head that says the answer should be A or B or C, and that the correct answer is D, but they forget the reason why. Here it is:
If you are paying a charge that requires that you have more money in your account than is there already, then the most appropriate answer to that question would be D (get the charge paid).
A ""Topping up My Account"" transaction will usually be a transaction, such as a debit or an overpayment, to bring your total balance up to a full dollar. This is often used for overdraft protection (the bank is paying you to have funds in that account, so that there is always at least one dollar in there). In that case, the fee charged is usually 0.35%, with a maximum of $10. In other cases, you can have a ""top up"" to your savings or checking account. If you do that, it's called a transfer. The fee for a bank transfer is typically $6.95 or less, or 0% - 1.5% if your balance is below $1000."

Do you see a possible explanation or intent in the statement? Can you think of some other possibilities that could be the meaning of the sentence as it was said or written? You may be surprised at some of your choices. I know I was.
This is a practice exercise for an upcoming vocabulary class. It might be a good discussion starter for a conversation with a native student. The answer is important for you to know because when you read a passage or passage from a textbook that contains a similar sentence, you might not know what the author/speaker was going for with the language. If the answer seems obvious to a reader, that means that the writer/reader can't think through an answer for themselves. There might have been a purpose behind the wording that isn't apparent. Perhaps the purpose was more than you realize (but I'm sure you will find out in your class). The purpose might also be something entirely unexpected. That is always true in real life. A person may say something in a moment of anger, hurt, jealousy, or frustration. And, as a result, someone else says, and writes, things that were not planned at the moment that something happens. Or, they say things to someone that they really don't intend to say, but that person doesn't notice because they are preoccupied with what has just happened. So, if this was a homework assignment, the teacher would have to be on the lookout for this kind of communication. He or she could ask for some examples, so that he/she can see how some students might interpret something. We'll talk more about this in class (after your homework), but, at this point, I am going to give you a few possible meanings for the question. Try this exercise to see if you can think about the possibilities, without giving up the most obvious one first because the others might surprise you. You might realize that your favorite was never mentioned in these choices at all. Let's go:
1. ""There are no fees to add money using an overseas card.""
There's a lot of good news here. They're saying there is money that can be added to your card. But, there are also fees. (I had to come up with these possibilities because"

What is the intent that best describes it?","Is the cardholder trying to use a European card? Or, is he trying an American card in a card that is designed to be used by European cards.

The card has to comply with all requirements of an international card which means it has an embossed logo in the middle or a magnetic stripe at the back of the credit card. Also, it is printed in another language than the one spoken or understood by the issuer. For example French Canadian issuers have a French name on the front and can be embelish in French. This type of card is called a bilingual card by most of them and a dual-language card if it also has the logo of another country. So if you see a credit or debit card from a country other than Canada it can mean you will need to pay a higher fee depending on what country the bank is from (not all countries charge the same).
But the best thing is this, there are many more benefits to buying a Canadian Visa or MasterCard over an Amex or Visa card for travel. We are going to list out a little bit of what it means to have one of these cards as travel credit cards and how they work. The main points I would like to highlight:
1. Visa and Mastercard cards: There are more cards that fit the bill for the traveler. Canadian banks are required by law to sell cards such as the Mastercards and the Visa cards in Canada. Many other banks sell only cards for their own brand name, but not the cards from the big guys. A few of those cards include American Express, JCB, Cirrus and Diners Club (Diners is no longer an independent brand but a part of MBNA Canada). All of which have some great benefits but are all a bit more costly (as in some can charge a fee for using the ATM)
2. Mastercharge: MasterCharge is not a bank, Visa have their Master Charge but Visa does not charge you any extra fees. You can use your visa or amex to access money when you get back home. However, you can only use MasterCarte when in Europe and when it goes to a MasterCash machine. When a visa card goes on to an ATM outside of Europe the machine will be called Master Cash. If your Master card can go to Mastercash machines the charges will only apply in that location"

If a person is able and willing to commit a crime it is no excuse for the police to be ineffective. If a police can use their resources to catch criminals then that person should be given more resources in order to make them more effective. The more police the higher the crime rate. In order for a better crime problem and arrest rate I believe more officers must be hired. This would allow the officers to have more patrols and thus the possibility of catching more criminals. As for this issue being more like the drug problem, I don't think it's that bad, but the fact that there are other options is a problem. I also do not think that the people who commit these offenses should not be punished just because there is another way to do it that is more convenient. It is also not fair that someone has to choose which method they use to go on their daily routine."
1030,Any Fee For Topping Up?,Considering this utterance: Any Fee For Topping Up? What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:
*Any*? You want ""any"" here, I'm assuming, not ""every"" or ""some"". So you can't have a fee for topping up the account, because you've just made it a case of ""it doesn't make any sense to top up"".
As for the question, ""Any Fee for topping up?"", the answer is no. If you are looking for a reason then that seems to be the end of the line.  I would say that the reason is because there are reasons. It may have something to do with the fact that a debit card is a cash-like system whereas a credit card can go overdraft. (In fact credit cards don't even have limits. They are often sold with an annual percentage rate. So they're effectively like loans of a specific amount every single month).
You would need to give more information about the situation for us to say what exactly to expect.
The only fee that's ever been levied for top-up is in the United States for debit cards of certain major banks. These top ups were in response to the crisis of 2008. I believe the reasoning was because people were not using their debit accounts so it was making it harder for their businesses, and these topups were used as a reward for customers who did use their accounts."

A: Oh, I see! So I owe you £3.20? You know that when you buy a ticket for a movie, you get a discount? That‘s why I want to borrow your £10 and use it when I go to watch a film. Do you know what I mean? [2] B: Of course. You“re telling me that the £30 that you paid was only for the ticket. So you want me to give up some of my £60 to you for an extra £40? Are you out of your mind? This is not what friends do. Is that why you are asking this? Or are you doing it for other motives. [3] Now here„s a better question… [4] Is there a charge or discount if I use a European bank in a top up? What does the expression really mean and how can I explain it to my colleagues? It seems that a lot of people use this expression, but I don”t know why. I‹d appreciate your help. Thanks.

1034,Is Their A Fee For Top Ups?,Considering this utterance: Is Their A Fee For Top Ups? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I would tend to say: ""What fees can top up the insurance?""

""I am in the process of moving to France."" ""It takes me a full three months to get there"" ""I live on the fourth floor"" etc.
Is It:
A. An introduction
B. A question about the purpose for the move
C. None of the above
I think A. It is an introduction, but I am unsure. I do not feel that I can say ""A person who wants to move to the US for business reasons is introducing themselves as such"" (or ""an introduction"" which I prefer). Can anyone confirm?
Thanks in advance. 
Regards,

P.S. Apologies for such a trivial mistake, this is my first post!
Edited to show answer: The intent of ""Is Their"" is ""Are there any fees to top-up the Insurance""
This is from ""Your Life, Your Money"" by Steve Sieh (p21) which suggests that it is B. but not A:   ""But there are things that are not in your budget, such as an expensive air ticket to Australia, or moving costs.""
Also found another reference here which gives the same result. However, I think my interpretation is correct. Thanks to all that helped. Please don't mark down the question as not constructive unless there is a problem with it. Thank you. :)

(C) I want someone else to do this for free. 
I would say that the best fit is B because it's more like:

1036,How Do I Top Up With Apple Pay?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Top Up With Apple Pay? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Intent is a key word when it comes to the human brain. It has three main functions: to represent what happened, to explain what the brain thinks has happened and to predict what will happen. For example: I am hungry and want to eat pizza -> Intent is to get food.
I am thirsty -> Intention is water. I was hungry -> The purpose of that action is for me to fulfill the desire to be filled. The desire, hunger, or craving in this case. All that information is in the intention. You don’t have to tell me the reason for the action. Because the information from that is already in my consciousness. Intuitively, I already know what I should do next. That is why you have so many ads telling you that they are having a sale, because you subconsciously know that you will buy that. Just because it makes sense to you. Same happens with this example with Apple. Apple is telling users to top up their iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch with credit cards because intuitively you know they will do it. And that‘s how this ad was created. There are two parts to creating an ad. Understanding the consumer through research and then creating the ad that makes a perfect, rational, logical match. This ad has created a sense of urgency through the concept of “how do I top-up”. Which made the users want the product more. By saying ” Top-Up and make iPhone 7 a better experience“. They make the message more interesting and engaging. As a result, the user subconscious will start to think about how to use the Apple pay. Making it seem more natural, which is an example of good creative thinking. In fact, there is always a connection between creativity and the unconscious mind. When we think and are creative, we are tapping into some level of the conscious and subconscious. To be more creative we must use more of our intuitive thinking, intuition or unconscious and less of logical thinking because this can cause problems when creating. So you can create an Ad and create a creative ad or you create one that will tap more into your unconscious which will be less successful. But if you need to create something logical and that fits your business strategy you must create that as well."

1039,"Google Pay And Top Up, I Want It, Can I Get It?","Considering this utterance: Google Pay And Top Up, I Want It, Can I Get It? What is the intent that best describes it?","Google Pay: a service to make online purchases, and top up mobile phones with money sent from the customer's bank account. It's Google's payment method, it was announced last October, a year after Google Wallet and in the same month Android Pay was unveiled.
In January 2017, Google announced that ""all Android users in Europe (including Germany) will be able to access [Google] Pay from their Android mobile phone.""
As for Google, they have been working on Google payments for at least 5 years, as the first prototype, known as Google Checkout, came in 2006 before being replaced by Wallet. Google Play, which was born just a few years later. In 2012, in their annual developer conference, the keynote focused on new and future trends in payments, including contactless NFC and online payments. But for users, that wasn't enough. Wallet, Android and Google Payments were only available in countries in which users of the Google apps and the Play Store can have access to a bank card. Now it's different, at last, almost everywhere where those apps are installed. And the top-up feature was the most awaited of them all. The Google payment system and Top-Up were introduced simultaneously in Google.com/pay. At that time, there were no other top ups that could be sent, just Google money, but today there are a couple of apps that use the service. There are also plans to add more topups with the next version of Chrome. For example, one of these topup apps is called ""Sending Money"" that works in conjunction with GooglePay. This app was developed by the company PayNearMe. I also tried top Up with another app, called TopUp. Both are based in Spain (but in both cases, you need a Google Account to use topUp) and are free. So, if you are not using an Android app and you don't have a way to send money to people in your contacts on WhatsApp or Facebook, both will work for you. Let's see how you can send and receive money via Google pay
Let's begin from Google Payment itself. To begin, log in to your Google account in any browser and then select ""My money"" on the left hand panel. If you do not have an account yet, use this link: http://goo.gl/eY3RZu"
1040,What Can I Use To Verify My Identify?,Considering this utterance: What Can I Use To Verify My Identify? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Intent is a concept that is often used in natural language processing, machine learning applications, business process management, knowledge management.
The term intent is used interchangeably with the term action. Some people use intent as a synonym for task or action, while for other people intent has a specific technical meaning as an action with intent. The term intention is sometimes used to define the action more specifically. Intent is also used as the root node of a taxonomy of actions with varying levels of specificity, for example, in a work-flow process, where the process can be more detailed with each step, or more generic with several variations. In this example the specific detail is that a customer must have a phone call for the business to process an order. Intents are commonly used across the whole spectrum of activity in the service-oriented architecture (SOA) world, from ""what"" to ""why"".
This is an example to use of the concept of intent, to clarify how it is being used. This is for demonstration of how intent can apply to a business context.  
Consider this situation. You are a service in an organization, that you have been given a task. Your job is to verify the identity of your customers. How do you verify? The most specific example would be verifying the person by name, as well as perhaps, a photo. But your organization is not that specific. It does not know the customer's name. There is more than just a name that identifies the individual you are verifying is your customer, such as phone number and address. As a result, your job has more to do as verifying a person than simply comparing the name to other names in your database. At the very least you need to check your records for that customer to make sure it has the correct phone and home address, if not, it needs to be added. Also you will need information to determine if the phone or address is real. Perhaps the credit card has not been used before as payment methods are sometimes not available at the time of ordering, so you might need the card for validation. And finally, you may need a reason why the order cannot be verified, there could be a technical reason for not being able to identify the information, maybe a database error, and so on. Each of these steps requires information that was acquired from multiple sources. So what do we mean when we say intent"

So, here’s the context of the utterances I used in this post. They‘re from a recent customer service encounter for a local insurance company. I was trying to get a claim settled, and in doing so, needed to validate the identity of my client, so that I could continue my conversations with the insurance adjustor. Let me just give you a few details about the exchange so you can get an idea of what this is like.

PS: the same question might apply for other utterables such as:
I Want to Know How It Works, and
Can You Explain That To Me? But I Don't Want To Hear the Answer.  :)
(this is a different question, since this questions does not mention intent or anything of that sort)
PPSS: in my previous questions, I've always used English as my native language. If I'm asking for help in Spanish, do you know of any resources for that (since my Spanish is not really that good)?  Or does that not matter? I mean that if the answer does involve Spanish I'll need an English translation to understand the meaning of my question. That's the main reason I asked this here in the first place. But, for people who speak Spanish natively, is there a special name for this type of questions that I can search for on Google? Thanks : )
PPPS I also have this doubt. Let's say I ask, Can I use an Android phone or tablet as a webcam? The answer is YES, of course, because the Android OS (I think that's what it is, correct me if I am wrong) is made to be a computer. So, can we say that the user wants to use this smartphone/tablet or even any Android device as if it were a video-camera? That would be an interesting point. I think this should be discussed because we'll be able to know the exact intent and therefore a proper and correct answer can be created. Thanks :)  (again, sorry if this sounds like a duplicate of another question)  PPPP This one can probably help to solve my other doubts :) (and I guess it could help you, too) Is this one related to the previous question? If it does, could you link me the resource so that people don't have to repeat all that info? PPSP I have also posted another Question here. It is similar to this but, again, not the one that deals with the concept, as I explained before. This other question is about the correct way of asking about how technology works, so feel free to check it"

How can I verify my identity: for a transaction, to confirm my age, or to prove my credentials? These are the three common scenarios where we need to validate or verify.

1044,What Is Needed To Prove My Identity?,Considering this utterance: What Is Needed To Prove My Identity? What is the intent that best describes it?,"In this post, I’m going to focus on the first part – what it is. I believe that this is an example of a logical fallacy – and as an engineer, when I find a fallacy, it‘s important for me to name it. If you aren“t familiar with logical fallacies, here”s a nice definition:
I‚ve been meaning to read “The Logical Fallacies in Plain English.„ by Dr Robert C. S. Peirce for several years. Unfortunately, the book has not gotten to that point yet. In this blog post though, what really matters is that we focus in on what the author has to say about this particular logical form – I have the feeling that that‟s where this form belongs and is most easily explained. The author‭ writes:‬‏
‫‪ ‧ ‍
It seems to me that in asking a question like this, you are seeking to prove that you have an identity, which is, of course, something that is impossible to do. You‡re asking for proof of yourself in something you‖ve done previously to no avail. Of course you cannot give proof. ‫
What the quote above highlights is a point that I made in an earlier post. There are two parts to the fallacy and what I think about them, is different than what he thinks.
The fallacy is: Inference to The Best Explanation. This is sometimes known as the Best Guess Fallacy. For example: The best explanation of something I did is…
This is not, in my mind, a good way of determining what―s the cause of anything. When you ask a rhetorical question, or question something like, ’ What is necessary to ‘prove my identity?‌ What really is interesting here is what is going on in the brain‮. Is it really a best guess question? I really think not. It is‹ a way for the human mind to ask and answer a very basic question. We need a name for that!

1045,What Do You Need For My Identity Check?,Considering this utterance: What Do You Need For My Identity Check? What is the intent that best describes it?,"I have a theory that the people who say things like this, and the ones that like to talk about their feelings. Or they talk a lot about what they want. Are the same type of people. The ones who have very little experience in life. Because there is a certain level of experience that a person must have in order to know what is important to them. And what matters.
And what doesn’t. There are many different types of emotions, but the three primary ones are: Positive emotion, negative emotion and neutral emotion. If you want to make a long story short, you must understand that emotions can be very powerful tools for us humans in our lives. Especially when they are positive and healthy. When it comes to relationships and other things that matter in your life, your emotions will determine how you react and your decision-making process. They are so very important that it is very, very easy to see why they can and do play a huge role in what you do. How you speak, act, speak and what choices you make, etc. I will try to give you some examples of the different emotions and how they affect you in different situations. In this post, we will focus more on the neutral emotions. As they will be more difficult to notice because they aren‘t really a good thing. For example, fear. But fear is not a negative feeling. It is just your brain‚s way of telling you something is dangerous and you should take extra care. To avoid that danger. So it would be negative if you didn“t listen and took your chances. Also a very common feeling that you might experience when you are about to fall in the water, for instance. That is why some people enjoy going to the beach. We enjoy the feeling of being in warm water. Even if we don”t enjoy swimming. You might find it hard to enjoy a warm bath because you don¬Æªt like touching water or your body is covered in some kind of skin problem. This could cause some issues with your ability to stay alive and enjoy bathing. Another example of an emotion that is more neutral is happiness. Why do we find joy when we are happy. Do we really like being happy or are we just enjoying the pleasant feeling? I really enjoy feeling happy and feeling good about myself and enjoying life the way it goes. Which is"
1046,How Do You Verify An Identity?,Considering this utterance: How Do You Verify An Identity? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What should I expect from the person in that situation? In other words, how do I verify someone's identity?

There are many reasons why you need to verify other identity information. The best examples of when you would need an identity verification method is at a business transaction, or an online transaction. For example, let's say someone sends a credit card in on-line shopping. You need a way of verifying if that person is really sending the credit information or not. A common verification is to send a confirmation email to the email address on file, and see if your email system returns a valid email from that account.
If you are working with government agencies, you may need additional verifications or checks in a specific situation. It depends on the agency's policy."

A typical example of this might be as a way to increase customer lifetime value (CLV) or customer satisfaction and engagement rate (Customer Service Index (CSI).
The goal may be to decrease a company’s cost of customer acquisition, for example, through the reduction of fraudulent sales attempts or by decreasing call center costs and inbound customer support costs.
Another possible business goal is to reduce customer churn (the percentage of a customer base who discontinue a subscription before their contract is finished). Reducing the churn in your customer list could save you money and make your customers feel appreciated and cared for. You may want to use identity verification to identify customers to make personalized offers that will increase the likelihood that customers will stay with you and will recommend you to their friends."
1048,I Got A Message That I Need To Verify My Identity; What Do I Do?,Considering this utterance: I Got A Message That I Need To Verify My Identity; What Do I Do? What is the intent that best describes it?,"My thoughts: If I’m not mistaken, this is an intent of a message that is delivered to you. It requires you to verify your identity. This type of message is usually triggered by a security breach of some sort; a phishing attack would be a perfect example.
It‘s quite possible and likely that your company uses the term “verified identity” in this context in their policies and in training for these kinds of messages. However, it would not hurt to confirm that as well. To do so, you would have to check their records if they have one. Otherwise you could also ask them to send you a document that lists your name, your organization, and your email address as registered at their company. If that information is there, then you should trust the person who sent you the message. In other words: it‼s your decision whether you believe the information or not. But since this type if message has to be verified, do not make it too difficult for the sender to complete it without compromising your data in the process."
1049,Are There Any Documents Needed For The Identity Check?,Considering this utterance: Are There Any Documents Needed For The Identity Check? What is the intent that best describes it?,"If you have ever wondered how to interpret any writing. You should be able to do this.
Let's look at how you do it. Let us say that you want to know if a
certain document that has been sent to you, is true. This document
says the following. Are there any documents needed for the identity
check? It sounds pretty clear, no? What do you think it means? You
think maybe it is just asking to see if there are any necessary
documents that need to be filled out. Do you need any forms,
invoices, or anything else? Not exactly. There are also other words
that go with that question. When you see words that are used, such as, if, there, need, etc. there is a good chance that this word is asking for some sort of information that the letter writer needs in order to identify
you. Here are some examples:
1. If you would like to send an additional piece of mail, please
complete our additional mailing form. It is necessary that we have
your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address in
order to deliver the package to the correct office. We would not be
able to give you the additional information by telephone. Is that
clear? Are you still unsure? We understand that some people are
difficult to ask for information. However, that is our job. I am
sure that if you call me right now I would be happy to answer any
questions that have to with the information request. That sounds
just like what the writing says. In this case the person is telling
me that they want the mail that I receive, but don't want that mail
to be opened until they are notified. How do I know that? Because
they tell me that it need not only have a name and address on it, it
must have the name of the recipient, as well. So, this type
of information needs to have your name on
it. They are asking if it would help if they give me this
information, when I do my identity check. The answer is no. My identity is not being checked. A person would also say to me
this is only for identity purposes. Therefore, they do not want you
receiving any other kind of package at all"

Hi,
In the question of verifying someone's identity, the first thought may be to use ""verify"". However, it should also be pointed out that ""identity"" should replace ""her/him/me/you identity"" in order to show which person it is being said to. Thus, there should not be ""his/his identity"", ""your identity"",""our identity,"" ""their identity."" ""The other person's name/identification number"" makes it clear."

1052,I Need To Verify My Identity,Considering this utterance: I Need To Verify My Identity What is the intent that best describes it?,"(1 = completely wrong, 2 = partly wrong)

The intent of my statement can be determined by the answer. (If the statement is completely out of context you will not be able to determine the exact intent. If the situation is unclear or the context is not sufficient to interpret the sentence in its context, then I have to guess the intention of the speaker by using clues from the circumstances of a given situation.)
I'm not trying to figure out what I'm talking about. I need to verify something.
Verifying something means proving that it is true, and that the fact has not been changed by an outside factor (such as time, or tampering of evidence). 
What I can do, what's the purpose of this verification, are you asking me what it's about?
(1) I'll check with my bank to confirm that you have sufficient funds to take care of all of these bills.   (2)  When I check online, I get a message that my account has been locked. My bank says that I must provide information that proves my identity in order to access the account. So I've been asked to provide my social security number. Do you understand what they are saying?  Do they know you are a person who is willing to help them with financial transactions? Is there evidence that your name is indeed the one with which they have identified you? Are you prepared to share this information with them? Do not share your socialsecurity number over the phone because that would be a security risk. It's important that only you access this account for the next few days while they investigate and confirm your identity. After you've passed their test you can log in using your username and password. That's what we've done in a number of cases. Is that what you're looking for? I am not your bank; we don't ask a lot of questions. You've just told me that this will take a day or so. We'll do our homework and verify your information and then we'll let you know."

What is considered a best description? The statement I made, or the one I intend?  Does the first imply I just need help from the bank, while the second implies that I want help, but I might not be asking the right way? Is this question even a valid question or should the answer be obvious? Should either of these statements be used instead of the other, since they mean different things? Are these even valid questions? Or should I rephrase it entirely and say: My Identity is Verified? That's an important part. 
Edit: The application is in English, so the statement ""My identity is verified"" would be a bit weird, I guess, due to my limited knowledge in this area. So the question is more about the English language version of ""Identity Verifier""

PS. Sorry for the formatting... I can't figure out how to put code snippets here. :/
Update: There are actually two ways of saying this:
""What will you do with this info?"" and ""What can you help me with.""
The first sounds more impersonal (I'd be curious to see what the person does with my ID), while in the 2nd case they can help someone by checking their identity (which is something they do), and not just by looking at a list of numbers. Is that right? But if they check it, that's helping them. It's a kind of impersonality too? So I'm confused about which one to use here? :D
Also, what if my goal is to make them feel they are helping me out, and I need the info they get to get this done? I am a very friendly person and am not shy to help others out in times of need, which is why I think I prefer the 1st, more informal, sentence. But I don't know if the people in my situation are the same way. :)
Final Update: Thanks everyone for your input. Here are a few more examples of what I've been working with, for clarification purposes:

To which he or she gives the affirmative or negative answer. Second, a request for an ID is submitted from the ID issuers (or from any authorized third-party institution for that matter), and a response is awaited. Third, after the response from this request is received by a verifying institution with the verification data of the request, an affirmative decision is issued based on this information. Thus, ID can also be considered as a verifiable information (as it includes a set of verifying details).
But, here's the main part (in my opinion):  'ID verification refers to the practice of confirming a document's authenticity, by comparing the data contained in it with corresponding data in an individual's record.'

1055,I Would Like To Know How I Can Verify My Identity.,Considering this utterance: I Would Like To Know How I Can Verify My Identity. What is the intent that best describes it?,"If I were to say the following, would this be grammatically correct...
I Would like to know whether I can see my own eyes?  
or
 I would like  to be able to see whether  I am having an illusion.  Or..
  would it be better to use I'd like or I should like? or  Would I be
correct in using I Want or Want To as the best expression that I could
use here?.
My question is which of the above expression is best in describing that
utterance and also how I Could be more explicit with the verb to make
things more clear. And the reason I'm asking this question it's not
because I want to learn new vocabulary but I feel my knowledge on
vocabulary is not that great but would really like any kind of help on the
issue that would help me in my understanding. If you could explain
it with example sentences too would be great.Thanks for the help in
advance. I've been told to go to the dictionaries and study it but
that's a tedious process. Please let us know if you can help!
EDIT: This is an example of a question I asked on ELU and was given
this link. It is also similar to my question but in a different scenario
(the first example you have posted). So if it still doesn't answer the question, then you should be all right and move to another topic. Thanks! :D
The answer to this: The answer is quite simple to both of those,
if you think logically. The first sentence states a fact, so you'd be  saying I
want to find out how  we can prove our identity in order to determine whether it holds or not. But if that was all you were asking, it would not have been necessary for you to mention anything else. You could also have asked, how can I determine the state of my identity. Or you would have had an entirely different question. So the fact that you mentioned ""whether it is true"" is in itself a statement. As for what it means... it could mean different things. To me it implies that your question was already decided and it was only necessary to ascertain the truth or falsity of what you stated. That's my opinion based on how you worded it."
1056,What Kind Of Documents Do I Need For The Identity Check?,Considering this utterance: What Kind Of Documents Do I Need For The Identity Check? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Is it:
A) The intent of the speaker, is to express to the listeners that he wants to know what kind of documents he has to show to prove his identity.
B) A warning from the listener that you need a document to proof your identity and also he warns you the documents you are trying to pass on are insufficient so he needs documents that are more valid and reliable. (In this case, he is warning you, to keep your real documents safe, so you should not show the fake documents on purpose)
C) This is a statement used to tell the person that is asking for something that what s/he is thinking about is not true. The speaker may think that that the other people may have some fake/invalid documents. This sentence is used when the speakers are thinking that their friends, family, and co-workers have not provided him any valid/reliable documents or that they have done it on accident so they should be careful about showing the same documents to other peoples on their ID cards.  
D) There is an implication in this sentence that we are not talking about the real identities. Rather, we mean to say that there are fake ones. In this situation, the document that s the identity checker gives is just a form that contains a list of identities, some of which are correct and other ones are just fake. So, you could say ""this is what I have."" or ""This is my identity"", etc. in order to describe it. You are expressing that this is your ""identity"" and this could be a fake one."
1057,Let Me Know The Steps For The Identity Checks,Considering this utterance: Let Me Know The Steps For The Identity Checks What is the intent that best describes it?,"Does the speaker mean to convey that she wants to be informed regarding her identity or she is simply stating that this would be helpful? 

A:
If you're asking this question, I'm going to guess that you know what the question really means: ""Can you tell me the identity checks that are currently used in the bank?"". If the answer is ""Yes"", you may want to ask, ""What do other banks do?"" If you don't, you might want a different word, since ""identity checks"" usually mean ""credit checks"".
I'd guess you want the other bank's identity check, too, so you could check how they do it. Or you can say: I'd like to know if other financial institutions do the same thing.
The answer to both questions is No, but the second one is less important because your bank probably does what other people do, even if people don´t tell you that."
1058,What Should I Do To Verify My Identity?,Considering this utterance: What Should I Do To Verify My Identity? What is the intent that best describes it?,"The intent could be to either ask about what your identity is, or verify your ID, which is to ask a question about whether or not your papers are legit, and your government issued ID is legitimate.

If you have the time, please check to see if your intent is clear. It helps with the meaning of your utterances. If you know the exact intent you’re looking for, you can easily find a word to fit it. We‘ll go through the words and their meanings. Here they are:
1. ID: ID can be an identification of who you are, but it is usually the government-issued ID‚Äôs that are checked. For example, it”Ås a lot easier to prove that someone who has a passport is who they say they“Æ¢Ï€ are. This could include things like the birth certificate, a driver/licenses ID/passport, an employment identification, etc. These are all examples of ID. However, if you don„Ç™t have an ID or the ID that you want to use is lost or damaged›ÑÔòˆ¨Ðª, then it doesn‡t really count. You could also try asking what ID the person has, where it was issued, how you could get it or who it belongs to, just to name a few. Also, there are certain IDs that the law requires you to have. (See this article in The Law of the Land: Understanding the Basics of Law).
2. Verifying: Verification is not about identification but about being sure that what you show is true, that it came from, who issued it, when it expires and how to obtain more. Asking if a person knows how many fingers you “ˇÒýÚ¤ÕÓÈÌÝÙÊµÜ‹Ø†À‰†¹‿‾Î¿Á‌¬ÉÍÿÉË, to show it to you, would be verifying that. So would, in a way, asking, „˜Öþ†í‟÷†,"
1059,What Are The Steps To Verify My Identity?,Considering this utterance: What Are The Steps To Verify My Identity? What is the intent that best describes it?,"What are the possible interpretations for this sentence?

It would be interesting to see how many interpretations a reader has of your sample text.
The sample of the question can be seen in this link:
https://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/question-id-2-identify-steps/
And here: https://english.stackexchange.help/questions/812
I'm a little surprised that this is still a hot question (it's been closed and reopened a number of times as a duplicate of Question ID: Which is a better sentence to ask about ""identifying steps""? ), but I did some searching and it does appear to be.  There are a lot of different ways to interpret the sentence and a few different types. I've provided two ways that might be useful for future viewers who are searching for a question that is asking: ""How should I say this?""
There are three basic ways (for a human) of asking this question in the English language: A way to get some specific information (what is your identity?), a way for some human to verify or test something (do you have ID?), and an indirect and somewhat humorous way of saying 'identity verification' (I want a verification of a verified identity).
In the sample you gave, there are two questions. The more specific question is about how to say the identity verification step. It is an open question, because it could be: 
Verify my identity. Is there anything else to do (to verify) before I can proceed? Is 'is there something else' enough? If you wanted to specify the next thing to come, is there another step to take before?   It could also be ""Do you want to proceed further?"" (If you are asking the person to make a choice, you need to use ""do"" rather than ""want""). Or, ""Have you decided?"" could work. This is not a single interpretation. Depending on context and the tone, a different answer might work, and you might have to decide between two, or choose only one of them. If the answer is ""No,"" then there is nothing left except ""I guess I'd better not.""
But the more common question: how do I go about verifying my own identity?, or ""What are steps to verifying a person's identity?"" is more general,"
1060,How Does My Identity Get Verified?,Considering this utterance: How Does My Identity Get Verified? What is the intent that best describes it?,"A:
The identity of any person is verified by many means. One of the best known and easiest of these is having a driver's license or some other form of government issued ID.
It has nothing to do with who's in an office somewhere. If a person has a social security number and a credit card issued by a major bank in their name then they have verified their identity as far as that society is concerned. That does not mean that they can't get into trouble for stealing identities (or worse). They don't necessarily have to have this to get a job. It has everything to with the company that is using their details."
1061,What Things Do I Need To Verify My Identity?,Considering this utterance: What Things Do I Need To Verify My Identity? What is the intent that best describes it?,"It is: ""I want to verify my identity"". It has the form: a declarative main verb (Verify, Identify) followed by an auxiliary verb, followed the by a noun or a pronoun (my, mine, your, ours, their, theirs, his, her, its, our, yours, etc.).

The most common form that occurs in the English language is “I verify or I identify”. This form is an example of a verb phrase which is formed through an apposition, or noun-plus-noun construction. A noun phrase that is attached to another noun as an ‘appositional complement’ is a ’verb phrase‘.
Verbs and verb phrases do not need a direct object. It can be implied; this will be indicated by the preposition ”to“: „to verify identity„ = ""To verify, identify, confirm my Identity‖. The noun that refers to the person (object) or thing we want †to confirm is in apposition to ‟my Identity.‟
In verb-phrase the ‚preposition' can also be ‧placed in ‛front of the verb‛. In this case it is‚ a prepositional phrase,› which consists of ‖a preposed noun‴ + the‧prepose‹ + a‣ verb. For example:
‰‡•※…‱‮ I check your Identity ‮ 
As you can see this sentence is very simple, but it shows that the structure is not restricted to verb + pre-position + noun. Other nouns, such as names (names and surnames) of people, countries, and objects, follow suit. We can verify that there are many verb forms with noun appositioins, as seen in this example. ′to check or ‴to identify´ are very common verbs. There is no single word that covers all cases in which a person has to be validated, verified, identified etc.  
Another thing to note here is that we use many forms of verbs as noun phrases and this can give us clues as to what we wish to say. Many verbs are used to describe a task, so that a certain action is undertaken. These"

1065,Where Do I Verify My Identity?,Considering this utterance: Where Do I Verify My Identity? What is the intent that best describes it?,"For me, it seems like an exhortation to a person seeking to have his or her identity verified. The answer to that question is that the person is seeking identification, as in identification as a user with the World Wide Web. This seems to be a new development in social networking websites, such as Facebook and LinkedIn. If one of my friends posts on my wall a picture of him or herself, my first impulse on seeing the picture, without any prior communication with this friend, is to look up his profile on LinkedIn to get a more informed idea of who the friend is. Of course if the social media site in question had a system for verifying who a member of the site is, and verifying it via an external service, then that would be very helpful for the user, but I am not aware of any such system in use, nor do I think that they are developing such a service.

This question does not seem to address the problem that many face, which is why their identity in the online world is not verified, in that there are no systems for verification in any social network of sites I know of. I don't want to use the phrase, ""Social Identity"", but the use of this term by the author seems somewhat appropriate, at least as it applies to people on the web. So in this particular sense, this question seems more appropriate to the Social Life, not the Identity Life. That said, the question was asked in an IdentityLife Q&A. _________
The term ""identification"" was coined by John McCarthy. He used this in relation to what he called ""Identification Theory"". The term was later popularized by a series of his publications on it. John is currently at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. His website is here. Wikipedia has a very long article on identification theory. Here is a link to his paper on social identity."

What is the intent that best describes it?,"This is a tough question, because as of yet, I’ll be the first to admit, this is something I don‘t always think about when I hear the expression. It”s something that usually comes up in the following situations:
You“re trying to set the identity of your company in a new market or a brand-new market.
Your sales force is getting ready to call or email on their first opportunity. The prospect has been given an Identity check to determine whether the prospect actually is who you assume or not… and, you want to make sure the sales representative is able to properly answer the questions. This is especially true, for instance, if you work with a prospect or customer who has a large number of companies or departments within her/his company. You„d hate to come back to your sales reps after the initial call and find out that someone made a simple mistake and didn‛t know the company‟s response to the question. Or, perhaps, the customer or prospect was a little more complex or the situation more difficult. And it just so happens, it‚s the same type of customer with the issue for which you‡re working on a project. But you just don't know. So you need to know ahead of time and you ask the prospective customer to do an „Identity Check‰ to get to a certain point. In my example, let‹s say the Prospect›s Identity Number is “ABC‏,‬ and she/he is an ABC Company. Let s also say that you have a sales rep who can handle the call. Do you now want this rep to ask if the person is or is not a part of ABC. If not, then the Rep can go about his/her sales process. However, do you think that is all that needs to be said? Do the rep and the representative really need anything else before you say yes, ‚I will authorize the account?‭ Or am I missing something? Is a phone number, email, or address required? Are they to send a copy of their most recent company annual report or financial statements? Perhaps some additional information needs more than just a verbal Identity number?

(I just realized I didn't answer your previous question about what kind of identity docs were appropriate. So I'll respond to that one now...)
If you're asking to document your access, make a list of all the users that you've given access privileges to, and make another list all of those same users' permissions to your system. Now you'll have a good idea of what users have access and what they have permissions; this is your documentation.
It's basically the process of asking yourself what are the things you control and don't control, what you have the authority to do and can't do, etc etc. If an admin is logged in, they get permissions that are different from those of an application user. It's really up to you to define and document those differences. But this list is generally going to contain all your application users, as well as a handful of super users like admin users. Your document should be a bit of both, to give you a complete listing of your users and their permissions. This is also useful for when you move to a larger team and need an easily manageable way of knowing what people can actually accomplish. For example, in a company of 500 people, it doesn't make business sense to have one person have ""full"" permissions, because that would only be granted for a few days. I know I can use this for my small company as long as I only ever grant a user 1 or 2 levels of access at a time, then I just give that person a bunch of admin rights to get things rolling right. You can make this even more fine grained, granting more rights or fewer rights as time"
1069,How Do I Go Forth On Verifying My Identity?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Go Forth On Verifying My Identity? What is the intent that best describes it?,"For me, it implies a need for identity verification. And that seems to be what we are talking about here. This is a big question because what verification should happen? What verification methods work best?

There's nothing wrong with having to verify your identity.
I'm a proponent of making sure people are who they claim to
be on the Internet, in life, on paper, etc. The world
isn't perfect and things happen. People do get stolen,
used, stolen again. Fraudsters make a living out of using
false identity and there is always a way to make money. We do
need to protect ourselves from the bad guys (as well as
protecting them from us) and we need a system like this. In that
sense, I'm all for verifying your ID. I just feel that the
way this is done in some cases, with a lot of hoop-jumping on a
lot of websites, is ridiculous. For example; when I log on to a secure
server, you ask for my ID and for the password. Why? Because that's
the only way I can prove to you that I am the person you believe I
am. That's just the way we have come to do it. (I think that this
process is flawed but, so be it.)
You are, and I mean it when you say you, not your parents'
child, who will need to prove this in a few short months. At
least not in my book. You've never seen your grandparents
pass along a child they don't know anything about. How are we
supposed to know that a parent is capable of being who the kid
claims to belong to? You are the only child your family is
ever likely to have. Even if you were adopted, that doesn't
mean your birth parents couldn't be out there somewhere. It
just means there's no way for your biological parents to come
forward and say they have you. But you have to go through a fair
bit. Just as a birth parent, your mother or father, or even
both of them can, would have the responsibility to let you
know who you are and to take care of you if it ever needed to. If
you don’t know, if your mom or dad just gave birth"

Beware of the ""Identity""

In your case ""the identity"" has special, non-literal meaning that is not the literal meaning: you cannot verify your identity by asking a third party for their opinion of your ID because you have no ID at all. That is, when you say ""what is my ID"" what you mean is ""where am I and who am/has I been?""

The biggest one is to ‘learn to live‘. To me this means accepting and enjoying the life that I have, no matter what it might be. When this is achieved my relationships become more meaningful, I don”t worry about things like what my ex-spouse wants, or if my parents would approve of who/what I am doing. This also involves accepting the fact that, as the saying goes, “you can“t change other people„ which has been proven by me to not be quite correct. But I do believe to some extent, you can „control‟ other aspects of your life. So, to get back to the point, it‰s all about what I can do to control what is in my own domain.
There‚s much more to this story of the ‚show who you are‛ than just the title. There is actually a lot of wisdom that can be gained from the words and the actions of others and I would love to tell you about a few of them. For one, the concept of ’acceptance‌. If you don˙‡t like someone or something you just ‌ ‬‹don't‮›‖ you have no reason to accept that person or situation. You are not the victim. It is you who has a choice to make a decision regarding the way you want to feel. Another is self-acceptation. Everyone has different ways of expressing what they think of themselves.

3. For the purpose of identification for personal and commercial purposes for identity theft and to protect you when opening accounts with financial institutions. The government or law enforcement may require it to verify the information is accurate and not fake. So what they need is a means to check and confirm your identity before giving you the money.

This is important to realize: In some cases, the person that you are listening to is NOT the one whose intent it is to say certain words aloud. The one with the intention to communicate something different. It's the same in reverse. For example, if someone tells others that they want a job, and everyone in earshot, including the speaker, thinks they mean they are going out for a coffee and lunch, they aren't. They might as well have said, 'I want to take an hour vacation from work to get a tan.' So what's important is that the listener understand the message sent by the communicator. In this sense, it's more important for the other party to understand than for them to know. There's an old saying: If you want the world to change, you have to be prepared to make people angry. I've often thought about that quote, especially during this past year. Why am I telling you all of this? For a simple reason, most people are not very good at knowing what they really want. And if that's one of your goals, as it should be, then I have a very simple suggestion and I think everyone else on this list does too. Ask yourself: What do I need? How badly do these things need to happen? If my answer is ""Needs to Happen badly"" then do this: Set a deadline for when you will be finished with your job. If your answer to the questions above is either, ""I need not be concerned because I am in good health,"" or, If I was really to think about it, that I can find a new job when I finish this one, THEN I will consider this to mean I really do need the job I had before. But only AFTER I do, do you need this job? I don't know how you can tell. You really don’t. That‘s why you should never work for anyone else without having a contract that is specific and clear to both you, your lawyer, their lawyer AND the people in charge of the company. A contract is an agreement in writing. To avoid confusion, all three parties sign it. No one should sign something without understanding it all.
