0,I Need To Know Your Exchange Rates.,Considering this utterance: I Need To Know Your Exchange Rates. What is the intent that best describes it?,"? What do these words mean? The most common and best approach to find the answer is to look at the context. So we do so.

A simple example can be: “I need to know your exchange rate” or ” I need your rate of exchange“. When asked, a person would simply reply, ‘ I do not know the exchange rates‘. In this very simplistic example, our answer does not reflect the real world. We have two parties involved. One who needs to exchange currency or money and one who provides or supplies. To complicate the scenario, the person who supplies the currency/money is a business person and not a casual person. That would be like asking a restaurant owner, how much the price of the dinner is. The answer he would surely give is, not only how many dinners the restaurant has, but also his own cost, which is based on the cost of his products; he is required to maintain and operate his restaurant. Similarly, this is how a currency converter answers. They have to consider what is their overhead expenses. Let’s assume, if the rate is in the favor of an exchange to a foreign currency they are charged with a fee, like the commission charged by a commercial bank. Then they have an overhead expense and a profit margin. This is what we are interested in. A currency exchange, as we would have guessed, charges the fee as it is an intermediary. Now, we know how it differs to the business and casual scenarios. Thus, an answer to this simple question: ""I Need TO Know The Exchange Rate"" will be the following:
„ How much do you need? How do I get it?‟
If the question is like, ""How to use?"" then the reply will not be just a yes or no. „ Do I have a choice to convert it or not? Is there another way to get the same result? ‟ etc..
What we have seen before is that a question can have many answers and some of those answers will make a difference. What we want to do now is identify all such possible answers in your data. I would say, that in a very high level the list should include: price, rate, exchange ratio, fees, commission, cost; but there are so many possibilities and there may be some other answers"

D) You owe me your life for saving you from certain death.

A) A = Intent

This is very important!
Your answer to the following must be in complete sentences. You must explain the meaning to a native English speaker. I want each one completed to your own understanding and not simply the answer someone else gave you. There is no such thing as cheating by this. Your job is to write your understanding, not someone elses interpretation. That is cheating. Cheating is an offense to others and yourself. So please don't cheat. Thanks!"

3,Where Do You Guys Acquire Your Exchange Rate?,Considering this utterance: Where Do You Guys Acquire Your Exchange Rate? What is the intent that best describes it?,", or in a few sentences?
1. Where do you get/buy your exchange rate? I can't help that it is an English problem.

4,How Do I Find The Exchange Rate?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Find The Exchange Rate? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? And what is your first thought in response to understanding the utterances intent? How does it make you feel?

What makes this question unique is that it asks a question where there is no right or wrong answer. You’ll know the answer based on an intuitive understanding of how you would answer the question “If I knew how to find the exchange rate, how would I find it?” or something like it. The question is designed to lead you into this sort of intuitive thought process where you come up with an answer that feels more right, more authentic and less contrived based purely on how your experience has led you to this point in the learning curve.
The question does not require any specific response as it simply asks the learner to consider what they would do in certain circumstances. This is an authentic question that requires a genuine response without requiring the response be in a specific format or even in English. All it needs to contain is a statement of fact and nothing else. A good way to test your answer is to simply answer in your own mind. If you find no answer, don‟t worry. It‘s a good feeling when you realize you‚Äôre still learning. And you won„Ðªt find an easy answer until you are ready to answer questions at a deeper level."
5,What Are Your International Exchange Rates?,Considering this utterance: What Are Your International Exchange Rates? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? What does it say about the speaker's state of mind?

My answer is: It says: ""I am a complete idiot.
I don't really understand what this phrase is supposed to mean.""
This is a common reaction. You may have the same reaction to it. Or, to make an extreme case, you may think it sounds good on the surface and not understand it until you read it further in the sentence. And this is why you cannot expect to understand all the English-language expressions used in a foreign country. It is not just that you don’t speak and understand the native language fluently. English is an international language used worldwide. Even if you can understand a language you speak, this does not mean you understand its language. That‘s why I said this question sounds like good English: it seems like the language was written just for the purpose of expressing the meaning “I understand nothing”. (I think I“m correct in saying this, because it is true. I know nothing about Chinese and nothing at all about Japanese. Nevertheless, I can read and speak Japanese with a decent proficiency. However, when it comes to Japanese grammar and expressions, my knowledge is extremely limited).
What I think is that if this sort of statement is in context of someone you are about to give a presentation and you say „What Are You Doing For Your Next Project?„ to a client, or to an important client of your company, then you expect the reply: ‚What? I don′t think so. Why are you asking such a stupid question? It′s just obvious what I′m doing for my next project! This is just an example that I found on Twitter. My point is to show that ‘What does that expression mean? (In this case I could say) What are your international exchange rates? because this seems to be a very short and clear expression used to convey the message of ″I‬ don´t know but I am sure ‬it doesn′T have to do with‪international exchange ‪rates.″
It is like a child who asks you to tell me what the weather is. To which you reply, ”I haven′›t the foggiest, but it doesn´′´ have nothing to with the ‹"
6,How Often Do Your Exchange Rates Change,Considering this utterance: How Often Do Your Exchange Rates Change What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

In addition you are able to use the phrase 'How often do your exchange rates change?' in a similar way in the past, at present and future tenses.
If the speaker does not have a precise definition of the time period, you should use an appropriate verb:
'...how often... do you change your foreign exchange rate?'
It is very important to know what time interval the person is talking about. You should avoid giving the wrong idea by using such expression as
""I have lived here since I was a child"".
You should be more explicit. Ask your friend about the exact time you would like to hear about in your answer (or avoid that kind of sentences):
1) What do/did you mean when you said ""How long does the exchange take? Do you know?"", 
2) Are you talking with me about 'how frequently do the rates changes',
3) How frequently does [the] rate change, (what is it referring to)?."

A: To advise what is, and what should or should not be done, to advise how to achieve desired results, goals, etc. An important distinction between the following two examples:

6. Which of the following is NOT one of two ways that exchange statistics are used? Write A is True, B is False, and C is Unclear."
9,What Are Exchange Rates Based On,Considering this utterance: What Are Exchange Rates Based On What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

This is an example of a common mistake that a lot of traders tend to make. For those new to this trading discipline, it is very understandable. You see a currency pair you are bullish on and you think you have found your golden nugget of information.
The thing is that there is no such thing as ""a nuke"". There are just a bunch of different currencies that will have some relationship with each other. When looking for this ""information"", you need to find currencies with a certain history of price action. This history is called a ""currency's momentum"".
If you look at this chart, that is EUR/USD, you see that the currency has been in a downtrend for a while. Now, if you had seen this pair for the past month, the price was going to come down, and if it had been there for longer, even further down. We don't know what would have happened, but what we do know is, there has not been much momentum on the chart since March. That doesn't mean that it will happen, nor does it mean what that price will be. There is just less probability of it happening. It is important to look for ""momentum"", which gives you the probability that this currency will go up or down at any given time. As this happens, we will update this thread to show what the future looks like. But, to be sure, this is only our best guess.


I see this type of trading as the most fundamental, because it's the only type that requires no assumptions, just the charts. If you assume it means this, assume the opposite means that, etc. So, while fundamental is more ""black and white"", it can be tricky because of the amount of variables and assumptions it demands, whereas a good technical trader has a much more defined view of what ""the rules"" are at least in general. And the more you try to break them, or force them to do things ""not supposed to"" the less accurate and reliable you will become."
10,What Are Exchange Rates,Considering this utterance: What Are Exchange Rates What is the intent that best describes it?,"? What does one feel when this phrase is heard? A simple way of describing this concept is to say that it is a ratio. A ratio is an abstract concept that represents the relationship one number has to other number. For example, the price of bread may be represented in terms of its ratio to that of a hamburger. In this example the ratio of the prices is 1 to 1. This simple concept of ratio allows us to compare prices to know if one is more expensive than another.

In a simple sense, an exchange rate is any numeric expression that relates two currencies, expressed in decimal. The concept was originally developed as part of commerce. At first, it was used to keep track of transactions, but soon a more accurate method for determining a country’s currency relative to another currency came into use. However, since exchange rates are often used in different contexts, there are different ways to look at an expression of currency exchange. Here in the U.S. exchange markets are measured for the purpose of determining what a currency will be worth when it‘s converted from one currency to the other. These rates can also be used by people to estimate foreign exchange fees when they are buying or selling currencies. Currency exchange exchange is typically the first question people ask when traveling overseas because it seems straightforward. After they ask this question, however, some people are immediately perplexed as to why there is so much confusion around the concept and why people can‒t agree on any definition, let alone one that makes sense. There is no consensus around this basic concept because people often use it and other exchange related concepts interchangeably. Exchange rates in foreign currency have become a central part in a lot of business transactions these days, so you can be sure you are going to hear this term thrown around a great deal. But the way to really understand the exchange concept, is first to understand where currencies came from in order to learn if you understand exchange, you will understand other aspects of that exchange as well. Let‖s start by going back in time to see where modern currencies originated. When currencies were first developed people had different systems for exchanging currencies with each other based on their needs. Some people simply traded things they couldn―‚t find or afford in their own country for things that they found and could afford to trade. Eventually, people started exchanging things through bartering. As commerce grew"
11,What Are The Most Current Exchange Rates?,Considering this utterance: What Are The Most Current Exchange Rates? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A : I want to know.
B : Are you sure you are talking about this? I thought I heard you say, you wanted to see what is today's exchange rate between United States and China. 
C : Sure, it is a very good price but is it the best available exchange rates?   What I think you asked for is an exchange, a currency converter. I'm not sure if that is what you meant. You can use the exchange calculator in the lower left, that works for a variety of currencies. If you type in, lets say the American Dollar and the Yuan or Renminbi then you want the result in Dollars per Yuan. There is also a chart and you can see the current rate for the past days. That is not the same as exchange. Exchange is when you take one currency and convert it to another and get the new price. So it's the rate at the time for that transaction, and not at another time. This would be a historical rate. And of all the rates. How to get it. In the chart, at top left you will see 'Exchange Rates for Today' and that's for currency that you typed into the box at left and then the 'Chart' at lower right is for currencies you've chosen. The 'Current' rates are at bottom. When you click on the Rates button it will show you the price in Yuan and dollars of the first currency in your chart box, in this case Dollars, then it updates for each of your other currencies in that box on your right."
12,Can You Explain Your Exchange Rate Policy To Me?,Considering this utterance: Can You Explain Your Exchange Rate Policy To Me? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? 
I am struggling to think of good synonyms for the first verb. Is the intended meaning something like, ""I want you to explain it to me"" or ""It is your job to clarify for me""?

A:
The phrase ""can you explain"" has the meaning ""is it possible to provide information?"" in the context. You could use ""explain"" as it is written here, but ""Clarify the policy"" would work fine as well."
13,Is It A Good Time To Exchange?,Considering this utterance: Is It A Good Time To Exchange? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? You would say a question or some form of inquiry. The answer you are seeking would most likely be yes or no, or if appropriate a time when you would be least inconvenienced by an exchange. This is what I think the question was, and it was not really a bad time to ask.

But what about when the asker is asking whether or not the time is best suited for the trade? Is it appropriate to state that time as the reason as to what might make this a ""good"" time?
How would one phrase it? 
Is it:
1) You want me to come by this weekend to see how it is fitting to you? (Which means you do not trust my answer)
2) Do you think it would work best for this Saturday?(Which implies I might be unavailable and I do trust your answer, but only if I get your response to the first question) (which might imply that it really wasn't an ideal time, it just sounded like it, so I am wondering if now would actually be a good time if you agree to trade).
3) Would you prefer to do this on Saturday at the earliest convenience? This implies that what makes it a better time than another would have to be that this is when I could do it.  It would not imply if Saturday is better than, say, Wednesday at 5 PM, then Saturday would win out because that might come later. (But if someone else wants to, Saturday has no implication either way about what time they want to have it)  Is this possible as an answer to an IMO question? I.E. ""The best time would..."" or ""If...""
4) Or something else? Maybe a variant of 1) or 3). Any other ideas? Which of these answers do you consider better, why? Why are they good answers to this, respectively? Are there any that are bad? Please do let me know. I just want the best answer that I can find. Thank you. ^^
NOTE: I'm new, having just joined the site two days ago. So, as I stated in a comment, I need to understand the etiquette first. However, this was a genuine question I really wanted answered, rather that an etiquette question. :)
Thank you in advance. :D
EDIT: Please also see my"
14,What Is The Exchange Rate Like On This App?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Exchange Rate Like On This App? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Is it: to ask about exchange rate, to express an opinion on an exchange?

An example:
We have been told that we should not be paying attention to the exchange rates as they fluctuate every day, because they are too volatile, but we would like to know the range in which the actual rates will be when we buy our vacation on vacation.
Would the phrase exchange like on this app be more suitable than the one we used. 
What does the usage pattern look like in English, especially in Canada?"
15,Do You Have A List Of Exchange Rates?,Considering this utterance: Do You Have A List Of Exchange Rates? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A list of exchanges rates.
  A list or set of exchange rates
The phrase means ""a list that gives the exchange rate from one currency to another"". That's a definition of it. 
So that means I am not a native English speaker, what do you think my sentence means? Is there another interpretation?   I think ""Do you know what your exchange is to your friend?"" is probably one of them too and this would be ""list"" but ""do you have a list""? is still not the best. I'd need a better word for that. If I need to rephrase I will. But can someone help with the sentence? Am I wrong? Sorry for my bad grammar, this is my first question. Thanks. : )
Edit: As for the comment that ""that's not what that question means"", I know it is not but do not ask you to help me. This is a question I'm asking myself and I want to know. ""What do I mean? How am I speaking?"" You could help you, but I do it, you help, and so you learn. Asking questions is just a way to learn a bit more. Sorry. :)
Also, I don't want anyone to answer that's wrong or that I misunderstood the question, they have already helped me with a lot of questions by trying to understand. The questions I have here are just for me to find where I get my errors and learn how to avoid them. And this was the first time someone answered it and pointed it out. So that was good. Thank you. Again. ; )"

The answer to the preceding is 'yes', that is, calculated is a word that can be used in various ways, it is not just one form as there are so many variations of it.
But in the sentence: what currencies is calculated in, what would one word be most suitable for it? What would best describe the action. Would one say : ""Calculated"" in a very short, simple sentence? or ""the currency is calculatively exchanged"" or would I have to use an adverb?

21,What Exchange Rate Do You Use?,Considering this utterance: What Exchange Rate Do You Use? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

If you answered: A question then it is a question phrase. But if you responded: I use a certain exchange ratio when making my calculations, it was an adverb. A good question word is not only the one you expect, because in the context of your thought it means something else.
A question mark (?) is in many occasions the only good answer word. It has a more neutral meaning, and is used in every question, no matter if it sounds polite (I asked?), or sarcastic (Are you serious?). If you want to use it, then choose one, you don’t really have to make the question sound polite or not. If your question is too informal, there is no use for it."

The Exchange Rate is The Rate of The Dollar In Pounds"
23,What Do You Base Your Exchange Rates On?,Considering this utterance: What Do You Base Your Exchange Rates On? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Does this phrase convey the speaker's idea clearly?

If this sentence describes the way you base your exchange rates, or the rates used to value commodities, you're not alone as many people base their exchange rate decisions based on what the other currency does rather than based upon any economic or other objective rationale.
In other words, the exchange currency is used as the yardstick for determining the value of the currency. If it is strong, their currency will be weak; if it's weak, so will theirs. The strength or weakness is what affects the prices of things in their country. For example, Japan's current weakness in the Yen has caused their prices to increase (or at least the price of their products).
As with any business, price is a function of demand and supply. In terms of exchange value, demand is determined by the current exchange prices for all goods, services, and commodities (including currencies). Therefore, for currencies, a stronger currency results in more demand for products, goods and services in countries that use that currency, hence, causing the purchasing power of other currencies to weaken. A stronger dollar, Euro, Yen, Peso, etc would be an example of a more desirable exchange. This is because of supply and demand. People who use other countries' currencies are seeking to obtain products and other goods whose value is higher in those currencies. So, they will use the currencies that are more valuable as their means of payment. As a result, countries with currencies of value will have greater demand, thus, greater supply, which causes them to be more valued. Thus, an exchange market is not a stable exchange and will only be stable when one currency (i.e. the base currency) is consistently more strong than all others."
24,What Foreign Exchange Rate Will You Use?,Considering this utterance: What Foreign Exchange Rate Will You Use? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? It is a simple, quick way of expressing what the person is talking about.

The first word or words of your utterances. The first words spoken. It can also refer to a single, initial phrase or statement: That is why I am going to take a look at the Foreign Currency Exchange Rates: US Dollar-Euro-Japanese Yen-Pound Sterling."
25,How Much Will I Get With The Exchange Rate?,Considering this utterance: How Much Will I Get With The Exchange Rate? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?
(B) ""I would like to exchange a US dollar for a euro""

It is clear enough that the first sentence can describe a situation where you would have no problem getting the exchange if you did it yourself. 
I'm not sure if the second one can. It could simply express a desire for currency exchange. But it could also be a request for the amount, which might be possible if I knew the current exchange rate.
Am I missing something? Are there other phrases I should consider? If I'm being nit-picky, I might add that I am trying to find the best phrase for someone who might not know the exact value of a currency. (They may not even be American.)
This might sound ridiculous to you, but I've seen it used in conversation before and always thought that it was strange (as in this sentence).
Thanks. :-))
Edit: The answers all assume they mean US$, I don't mean that. I meant any currency and US$ or any other. In all cases, the answer is ""the current US\$ amount of that currency"" (if that makes any sense).   :-)  Thanks. Again. Thanks all. Really, thank you all very much. And that is all I can say. :-)
Update: If it doesn't make things more awkward: ""How much would I get for my exchange?""  I was wondering if it made more sense to ask that question in a different, more direct way (not as the main question, mind you), but the answers to a more focused question seemed to make more intuitive sense than my current question. If my question was a poor one, that's why I didn't ask in the way I did. So, sorry. Just a question out of curiosity and a way to clarify something. Sorry if my questions came off as offensive. All I wanted was an explanation as to whether it's possible to use the phrase in its current form and it may come off that way anyway. Apologies. :)  Thank you! :> )  (Sorry if that was not clear, it wasn't meant to come that away)
P.S.: If someone could please explain this to me, ""You might say ""how much money will I be getting for this exchange"" if asked by the person in person."""
26,The Exchange Rate Would Be?,Considering this utterance: The Exchange Rate Would Be? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?
A. Determine the meaning of the utterances.

B. Analyze the grammatical structure of each utteranced by the use of conjugate forms of verbs and the appropriate prepositions to complete the preposition phrase. Use of a thesaurus to identify the best alternative verbs."
27,What Is The Exchange Rate Like?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Exchange Rate Like? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

1). It is an expression of curiosity about what might be happening to the value.
What else might this exchange rate be like? For example, what is going to happen to that value if, for example:
A) the Euro is a basket of currencies and it is pegged against the dollar. So if the euro goes up, it could also go down if it was part of a currency basket. This could be seen as: The Euro Might Go Down. Is the expression, I think. I am not sure about the exact phrasing of this one. If there were a better phrase that I know, please let me know. For now: I will not consider it for now. But, this expression does make sense to me as to what the thought behind that expression is. It could describe the thinking behind it, if a person wanted to express that.2).It is also a curiosity that could have different interpretations: Is this about how much is different than it has been at the same time, in the past? Is is about some sort of future? I don't know exactly.3). This expression could mean different things depending on other expressions that the person is using at that time. As long as those are all clear, there is nothing wrong with using multiple words.4). Also it can mean, or indicate a feeling, about whether someone thinks that, they don’t know how, but they just hope to be correct, that it won‘t be as high/low as it used to been.5). As with #4. this can also be about a desire to have it low.6). Another way to say this phrase is: This must be really bad! or: this must have gotten worse already. Also, depending if there was a previous good/bad or good now/not so good in some other way that you want to compare it to, and also if other people are using such expressions about this.7). The same idea as #6.8). Or this could indicate, maybe, the feeling of having been disappointed and wanting it not to get any worse. (or it might just be to indicate that he is having the worst experience yet).9). Same idea, of being disappointed about it as in #8.10).

28,How Do Your Exchange Rates Work?,Considering this utterance: How Do Your Exchange Rates Work? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I'd have said, ""what's the best way to calculate foreign exchange rates"" in the past. Nowadays, that would translate into, at least, the phrase ""how do you calculate exchange prices"" with the ""to"" of ""calculate"" implied as ""price"" and ""you"" as the addressee. In the context of the question, I'd also add ""with what's available as data"" after the word ""methods"" because the OP has already implied that he wants to know the method of exchange calculation. I'm not sure what you mean or whether you're trying to imply that the answer could be found by looking for an exchange rate calculator, but I think that you can just say, 'how exchange calculations are made'."
29,What Is The Exchange Rate?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Exchange Rate? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? How can we determine the exact meaning? It is also interesting to find out whether any of the different types of phrases in the same question are better at capturing the meaning of this question. This question can be seen in a variety of contexts. For example when you are at a restaurant looking at the menu, or you see prices on items.

For the purposes of creating a model, we can assume that the following question is being asked: “What is a good exchange rate to pay for this?” This is assuming we have already made the decision to make this purchase. If you were asked this at an airport, you may ask the person making the exchange to repeat himself. ‘What was that again? Can you say that in English this time? That is better than the last time I asked you what the rate was.’
If your exchange is more complicated, then your first inclination might be to use the word rate. However, I recommend avoiding that one because it is too broad. It could refer to a number of different concepts such as the currency exchange, the interest or dividend rate of a stock, and the price or rate at which a company makes a product or service available to you. In the context of our example question, currency is only part of that. Instead you could ask:
When you use a term such that it describes all the objects of thought, all those objects become a single object (e.g. the sun is all things in space that is luminous); the whole of your thought is in that single thought. (A similar idea can also be expressed via the thought: all my thoughts include every thought I think.)
It can take time to grasp that this statement is correct. When reading, it can seem to contradict other things you know about logic. I have tried to provide the proof of my claim. Once you understand the implications of logical statements, this kind of reasoning can really improve your thinking and your understanding of logic and reasoning. My goal is to demonstrate that understanding logic will improve how you learn, understand, process, reason and think about everything you read, listen to, watch, etc. in your life. So, if you have some free time, please try to do all of these exercises. You can learn from the way the exercises play out in my mind when I use them to improve my knowledge, thought"
30,Where Did Your Guys Exchange Rates Come From?,Considering this utterance: Where Did Your Guys Exchange Rates Come From? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? I would argue that the following sentence is not only a correct one for its word, but it’s also a good sentence as well.

“Where Did My Guys Come from?”
A: “It is said that in a game, the winner will be you, that is to say, I lost, so where did my guys come from.‘
In this case, there is a ‘they„ and so, we need to add the verb „came‟, which indicates that my guy came from ‚‚a place from which the guys (who are the contestants) can come. (We can understand that ‫comes‭ indicates ‬courage‬ in Latin, because the ″c‰ in ‪cames comes from the Latin words for ‭cave‮,  cattle  and for the place or country ‹gens›). ‑Tus ,‏  tum‹, as the meaning of ‟ it is‡, comes from this verb. In the case where the contestant won, he/she is called the 'winner', which is 'tus'. In this way we get the phrase: ""the winner is you‛. The same thing happened when the game was over, where we got ”the loser is me‖. But, in this phrase, it is easy to understand the correct meaning and in that way it can be used, for example:
B): ‖T‪, T•, is it? T came to me, and that you won?
or
C): We are here again, to exchange the cards, don't you remember? ‌Where did you get them, from here? or: Don‧t you think that we exchanged it again? 
D): Tus, you are going to come here to work tomorrow, right? (The 'to' in 'you are gonna come' does not mean 'tomorrow, now', because I'm going (‑gonna ) come (to/from) you'. I mean, 'T is gonna (come) to/for you').
E): I need a man, can you help"
31,How Are You Determining Your Exchange Rates?,Considering this utterance: How Are You Determining Your Exchange Rates? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? The answer to this, as with most of our questions in this section, is that the answer is both yes and no. The phrase may be used in many different ways, but most often in the context of asking if another person is doing something correctly. For example, ""Are you determining your exchange rates correctly?"" Or ""Did you determine your rates properly?"" And it may also be that we are using it to express that something isn't working at all. ""You aren't determining exchange correctly."" This is another example.

So the question remains: What does this phrase mean? Well, in general, it means that someone is making a mistake. But it also means, just as clearly, that if someone else was doing this same thing, their mistake would be obvious. In that case, there is no need to say that a different person would have done it wrong. If your question of ""correctly"" has a negative intent, I would suggest that you should use the word incorrectly in place of correctly (though incorrect isn’t a one word answer). You may ask ""What are you doing with your calculations incorrectly?"" In the same way that an incorrect calculation would look different than a correct one, so too would ""incorrect"" be different from ""right"". In a question using this construct, the speaker is using ""incorrect"" as an emphatic form of 'wrong' (see note below).
A note on 'Incorrect' and 'Wrong': The difference between ""In-correct/WrONG"" and ""Inc-orrect/WRONG"". The first is an emphasis, while the other is simply a statement. It can be confusing to think that when you see ""what are they doing is incorrect"", that it is not being used as ""wrong"" or that one is being emphatical while other isn'e. However, if you are speaking quickly and want to emphasize that your partner is ""doing wrong"", you would use 'inc-incor-er-rectly' instead of simply ""that thing they are doing/is doing"".
Note on Emphatics. Note, also, on other types of phrasal constructions that use emphatics such as these: The use of the emphate is often used to convey an intent (such as the one above, which may indicate that another's actions are incorrect"
32,I'M Trying To Figure Out The Current Exchange Rate.,Considering this utterance: I'M Trying To Figure Out The Current Exchange Rate. What is the intent that best describes it?,"? (Please try to make your answer meaningful by explaining what you mean by your words.) What can be used to replace the pronoun ""I"" in the sentence?

For the example I provided, I would choose the following phrases to clarify the meaning of the original uttering:
""I'm trying to figure out the current exchange rate"". This would change the phrase from a statement of intent into a question.
Alternatively,
""(I)m not quite sure"".
Both phrases make the same statement. The second phrase is a little more polite and can also be useful if you are using the expression in writing instead of saying it to someone. I use this one more than the first phrase as it makes the reader know that the statement is being qualified. If you wanted to use the second one in print, you might consider writing something like this -
'I m not exactly sure what the exchange is' or
'my guess is that it is $X, but I cant be sure.'
You might try something with a different verb. For example, instead using ""im"" or ""are"", you could say I'm guessing (or I suppose). Or I think that this should be $Y and that is why I want to know the rate, or it's my best guess that $Z is what it should cost."
33,From Where Are You Getting Your Exchange Rates?,Considering this utterance: From Where Are You Getting Your Exchange Rates? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

  * The first word in such utterances is ""How do you..."" for example, how are they getting their exchange rates, where are the sources of their information, what is their source, and so on.
   _The second word is a verb that describes what they are doing with their money_.

What is your impression of the person's attitude to their wealth as they ask you these questions? Does it make you think that you are dealing with an emotionally unstable man, or does it indicate a sense of pride and self-esteem?
In most cases, there is no real intent or motive behind the question. The questions are asked, not because they need the rate, but for their own sake or for what it can tell them about you. For example:
The question, How long have you used credit cards? is asked in the hope of finding out the length of your employment. This gives information about your past employment, because there have been times when you didn't have a job or were a trainee, when the time of service was not recorded. Also, it is useful for comparison with friends who have different employment histories as it tells them what your average length is of having a full-time job. When someone asks you how tall you were at a certain age, he or she is trying to find this out in order to tell you what you looked like. In the same way, questions about how much of this or that money is invested, etc, are not really interested in what the answer is, they want to use this information to judge the size of a person, in terms of his or her wealth. How tall or rich is this person? This is usually what people are trying, rather than finding the exchange rate of dollars to pounds. However, the information the other person gathers is also valuable to them. They find, for instance, out that the bank where a large deposit was made recently, has had a problem and the account is overdrawn. There are all kinds of possible motives, which are of no particular interest to us, only their effects. Some people ask questions just to be nosy, to satisfy a basic curiosity about the kind of life that other people lead. It is very unlikely that this will be the motive of someone who is doing business with you, as their motive must, on the whole, be"
34,Can You Tell Me The Foreign Exchange Rate?,Considering this utterance: Can You Tell Me The Foreign Exchange Rate? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? I think the speaker intended to say:

A. I can help you.
B. It’s up to you if you take a walk or sit around and mope all day. [1]
C. If you need money, call me or your friend. / You might need to get some money. (This is how one says ‘if”) / We‘ll have to talk about that later."
35,Why Do Your Exchange Rates Change,Considering this utterance: Why Do Your Exchange Rates Change What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Why? What? When? Where?

Now think about this: You can have one of the same thoughts with a few phrases. Which are most commonly used in the English language? Think about it, and try writing a new thought and see if the different phrasing makes a difference.
I hope to see the answer in a future post. It’s going to be fun!

36,What Kind Of Foreign Exchange Rate Will I Get When I Exchange My Money?,Considering this utterance: What Kind Of Foreign Exchange Rate Will I Get When I Exchange My Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? How do you describe it when someone asks What does that phrase mean? What are its possible definitions?

If you said: “It’s the rate at which an economy will trade its money for an other.”
Then you should consider it‘s definition for the same reason that you have to consider the possible definition of an ‘exchange rate“, „currency„, or ” exchange rate ‟, and † ‚ exchange ‡rate.

37,What Is My Foreign Exchange Rate?,Considering this utterance: What Is My Foreign Exchange Rate? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The two answers to the previous question are ""rate of profit"" and ""opportunity cost."" These words describe a similar but not identical idea. The phrase ""What is my..."" is actually the phrase ""...profit,"" but that's a very long way of saying ""profit."" There is no other way to say ""my foreign exchange"" except to repeat the word ""cost"" (opporunity cost).
There's some evidence that the phrases ""foreign exchange rate"" or ""Fx Rate"" has a currency symbol that makes it easier to spot the currency when searching for an answer. I couldn't find a citation for that. If you find it, please let me know.
Also, the exchange rates used in Fx are generally quoted with a + or - sign to distinguish them from the spot rates, which don't have the sign. ""3.00 = $1, = +3/$1"". If I had to do it in writing, I would say the F.R. (for future reference) rate is ""$3 to $US$1"" with the US dollars on the left. So the answer to your title's question is just the usual way we talk. It's not a formal way; it's just what we say. 
(A quick google search for ""My foreign Fex Rate"", for instance, will find the article ""The Future of FX Rates"".)
I would expect a professor of economics or a journalist to use words like ""exchange rate"", ""spot rate,"" ""forward rate""... instead of the ""FX rate."" Those things exist. But we use the common phrase, and the same words. That is, in my case, not ""an answer"" but ""a way"" to describe the idea being expressed."

42,I Need My Card Quick,Considering this utterance: I Need My Card Quick What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I need my card is more like: “What’s your hurry?” I need it to pay my way through life.
“You look like you need your card right now‚? What are you afraid of? Why won‘t you tell me? If you don„t want to tell, maybe I›ll find out by someone else. You don't have to explain, I already understand.‬
The difference between „I‡ll get it right away‰ and ‚‛I want it now!‭‹is in context . Context is important in interpreting. When you hear something‪, you are interpreting in relation to other things. 
In ’I Want It Right Away . I understand the difference ‭because I know I want something. My ‘want‖ is based on what I can use for myself and my family and what they need to buy, not on ‪what the other person or situation can provide. It is not based upon how long it might take. The reason might be that I have a need for something today and need this person to wait because I'm in a rush. Or my reason is that it can be done quickly and I don' t have time to be slow. Either way ‍it is a want. As such it s a desire that has to do with me and mine. A desire for another person, especially a family member or child can involve a sense of ‬want to ‰but it doesn‟t involve the same urgency in time needed. Such ‐ desire is ‮‱‫′need‌. ‧ It can even involve an ′I have‮ and a ‡ need to  ‏ ‗   ‑for‧the other; it also involves a feeling that if I let you have ‹it‵, that you won't ever give it back to me, because you will know it was mine and so you would be cheating me.

43,How Long Will It Take To Get To Me?,Considering this utterance: How Long Will It Take To Get To Me? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
There is no single word meaning. If there were, it would need to mean at least one word, and probably more than one. It is like ""How long will it take"". There would have to be a reference, but the reference is to an unspecified interval of time. The question ""how long"" is a question about time: what is it now? ""To get to..."" is about location: where? This question is different because in addition to the time aspect, the question has to take into account distance, that ""get to"" does not have the same meaning as ""reach"", where reaching is just one possibility among others. ""Will the trip to... be long or short?"" is also different, because there is an implied condition: it will only be ""short"" if it is ""long"".
In short, ""to get there"" doesn't have a single meaning, like most phrasal verbs do."

For those of us who have grown up with the use of the English language, we know there are a lot of different ways of expressing the same intent.

This question has arisen because I have encountered a number of people who use this phrase. I've asked a few people and they all have a different opinion. So I ask you to help me decide. And, as you can tell from my previous comment, I was not asking for an answer, just a discussion. (I am not a native English speaker, but I am learning).

It’s a rhetorical question. ""When will my card get here"" is a request for information about a future event. The question is asking, ""How long will it take to get there?"" The implied answer is, “I don‘t know.”
In short, it‽s not really a question, more like a comment that might be accompanied by a shrug-type gesture. It would be a good guess that it was an Americanism of some kind. As it is not idiomatic in any of my native European languages, however, one can only guess. Maybe it originated as an imitation of somebody who has some American accent?
The fact that so many people use it in this context is interesting. But as nobody can give you a satisfactory answer to your question about its origins, you have to ask yourself: what‹s it to you? :-)
PS: ""I'm just wondering"" and the variants are used to indicate a certain level of uncertainty. See this link for a list of examples: http://wordreference.com/en/uncertain/
(The link is currently dead, the page I mentioned it on is up.)
""I‟m just... wondering when...""

45,Can You Get Me My Card Fast?,Considering this utterance: Can You Get Me My Card Fast? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

a) Getting my card to you so you may use it to buy more things.
b) I would like my cards so that you can buy them from me. (I want you to spend money with me)
c) The card is my way to control people. I want this because it is a method of intimidation to keep them away from what they do not want. This statement was made by the owner of a store. She wants her customers but she is afraid of letting them have things to make them mad. The statement has two possible meanings. One is it lets her control her own customers, the second is her saying that her business is like an amusement center to the public and not to let anyone make any mistakes because they are her cards. So she does not let them play the games she likes to watch them, but they can play what she wants them to play so they will buy what is for sale. If you are going to do what I do or buy something that is very expensive then you will have to get me my credit card."

49,I Need My Card Quickly,Considering this utterance: I Need My Card Quickly What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

This question can be answered by asking yourself, “What do I need this for?”
“I need my card because I will be paying for my lunch soon.’
When you look up the definition for the verb ‘need‘ you find this synonym: † ‡
need ” to be in a particular place or situation ‗ I must leave the office to meet with him/her.
The meaning of the word „ need ‟ in the sentence I ’ll be waiting outside is a general need rather than one specific to a situation or location. For example, you may say I really need to stop at the grocery store on the way home from work, but you would probably not say, I desperately need the paper. This indicates a need that is urgent or compelling rather
than merely necessary. I might need milk and bread, because bread is good for me, and milk is necessary, or there may be other specific uses. The following are also synonyms for I. need : ‚ to
want‛ want ‎ desire‚ must, have to‏ be obliged to, mustn ‐t have a duty, be required to, require, need.
For this word, think about which of these is most like ‒
be obliged ‏to ‑ have in mind. A student needs to study for tests and will lose points for missed work. However, a person may study by themselves for fun and do well in spite of having to do so. When is it necessary for someone to see a doctor for a problem and when is there a compelling or urgent need? If you are
having trouble, go to the library, where you can look for help. Your teacher may know the answer and be willing to help you if you ask. But if an emergency happens, do not hesitate to call your doctor. You would not want to need him when he is busy with other patients. Need is sometimes used in situations
where we would be very annoyed or even angry if the need were not fulfilled. It can also indicate urgency. She is really in need of a good haircut right now! A. We have met this student many times and he/she always talks about needing a certain book that we have never heard of. B. ″A student must study hard"

Is it a request for the person who is to perform the delivery
to the us to hurry up?

an expression of impatience to have something done and done with?;
or
perhaps an expression conveying the idea that something ought to be done, and that the time allotted by the speaker for that purpose has passed.
The verb can be either ""come to"", ""get to"" or ""to come to"".
Examples:
I have an appointment that I will have to arrive to at 2 p.m. - it should reach me to. I have a meeting that gets to start in half an hour. This should be delivered to us. You should let us know, so that we do not miss our flight.  I would like to come up with some ideas for her to deliver to you at the office. The teacher came to the meeting and did not let me miss the test. Please bring it to me as soon as possible. (to be used as ""I need..."")

51,How Long Will It Take To Arrive?,Considering this utterance: How Long Will It Take To Arrive? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The first meaning which comes to my mind is ""How long will it take to arrive? or will you deliver it?"". But is this correct? I can understand ""To arrive"" but I do not get ""Deliver"". 
And if it is meant as ""Will you?"" and ""deliver"" then the full sentence becomes:
""How Long will 'you' arrive / deliver this parcel?""
How could I then express that it will be late when I say ""The delivery is due at 1pm"", if I use ""When will this arrive?""?
Or would you say that ""arrive"" is not appropriate but rather ""the delivery will arrive""?
What I want to convey is that the parcel has arrived at this moment, i.e. after one hours time, but that I am not sure as to when it arrives or if the delivery has been made."
52,Can I Have My Card Delivered On A Specific Day?,Considering this utterance: Can I Have My Card Delivered On A Specific Day? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

Intention: The reason or cause for which a person acts or does something.
In this case, the author is asking the post to the delivery is on a specific date of the week. The author wants to know how to specify the day that the card needs to be delivered on the specific week of a month. I believe that this is a question about delivery dates and the way that these are specified. If the date needs specified this needs a date or week day, so a day of week or a week number or number of weeks. There is an easy way to find the correct answer because the phrase, ""I need my card delivered"" is not very descriptive of delivery date. This is more of what needs delivered. It could be more descriptive, such as ""Can I have my birthday present delivered this Tuesday"" or ""What is my credit card number needed?""
Another example is ""How do I send payment for the balance due for January?"" or how about ""Do you have a delivery policy for gifts?"" If you do not specify a policy, I would expect that it is delivered to you as per your stated policy. For a gift, you might want to consider a birthday, anniversary, Christmas, or Easter gift delivery. A policy might be as simple as,
""Please leave message at 1-800-555-1212"".
If you want a custom gift delivered the next day in the morning, for example, it might require a special gift order. You might need to go ahead and put in a reservation for a next-day delivery and then confirm the order, and you can pay for that gift and it will be waiting for you at your house or at the local post office. Or, if you would like a card that is mailed, then you may not want your gift to follow until the very next business day so that your card would arrive in time. But you are not interested in any of this because you already have what you need. So you ask, 'How about next Monday'? What do you think is going to happen? I think that you know the answer that will work best: you will get your order and your birthday gift. And if that's not what is desired, just specify that in your question and leave the question as is. Don't go off-course and get yourself lost."
53,What Is The Difference Between Standard And Express Delivery?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Difference Between Standard And Express Delivery? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Express, I’d say. There is no subtle difference.

And yet, the standard, for which there is still plenty of debate, continues to be used, and sometimes abused, by the media as well as by people in retail who want their items to arrive as quickly as possible. Standard delivery usually takes 3-5 business days depending on when they go out on the route, while express delivery is usually 5-8 business. But there are other types of deliveries, like rush delivery and overnight deliveries that you can ask about on Amazon if you are unsure. In order to understand what these different types are and when to use them, let‘s discuss what they are. They are as follows:
1. Express delivery. It is available through the Prime delivery service and allows you to specify a time you want delivery to occur. Prime members pay an added fee but get the convenience of same day deliveries. You can choose the day you receive delivery when you place your order, or they can be scheduled for a later date or time. If you choose a specific day, you will be notified when that day arrives. Amazon uses different carriers to deliver the items so there can often be delays. For example, if your item is coming from China, it may take an additional 2-3 weeks to reach the United States. And if it is an order placed with Amazon.ca, there will probably be a day-long delay to get to you. However, this time may also reflect the time it takes for your package to come from the Canadian warehouses to the US. Some orders will get there faster or take longer depending. This is why you need to check if there was an express shipment when the item shows up. When you order something from Amazon, even if the order comes in on Tuesday it will not show up to your door until Thursday or Friday unless you tell them otherwise. Your package can take up a lot of space so it needs to pass through an Amazon facility before it can leave so a delivery can last up tp a full day. So if this is your delivery date, try to leave a little extra time to receive it after the date is displayed on your screen. I have always found it best to order things on Monday so you do not need a weekend in your plans. Another point to consider is that if a package is on a"
54,Can It Be Delivered By A Specific Date?,Considering this utterance: Can It Be Delivered By A Specific Date? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Does it imply that something will happen on a particular day?

In a situation of uncertainty or of need for immediate information, I can ask: What will be the consequence If the answer to my question is ""yes""? I am not asking: Will it be this or that result? My question does not imply an answer, but a condition: If.
It is clear to me that the sentence ""Can This Be Done On a Specific Day?"". The answer is a simple ""Yes/Yes"" (and the question has been answered) - but I don't know where it fits in the list - because it has an implied ""or"".
I am wondering, is this a question of a ""simple"" grammar? I mean, a single word answer doesn't say much, and if my sentence has ""OR"" and is not wrong, why should it not appear in a list of questions with a specific answer? What if the ""can"" is replaced by a verb that implies the future? Would this be OK? And is it OK if there are more than two possible answers? For instance:
Can it Be done before May 15?   -- ""No"" / ""May 15""
 
or
Is it possible to start the project on May 17? --
""Possible, If..."" (yes or no)
The point is in asking what I asked, the implied answer will come along as well. If I ask for two options to choose, it will imply one option. I cannot make an implicit ""IF"". If my implicit condition is wrong (like: ""If it is possible, then...""), should I omit it? Or is there some rule that makes it necessary to add the implicit word(s)?  I think of my condition as if it was a clause, with an ""if"". Should I then treat it this way, or is my intuition wrong? Is it wrong to ask if a thing will or will not be done on, say, Sunday, March 30, 2020? If it happens, that would be awesome (the implication is that it's possible).
If I write ""Is It Possible To Do This On March 31, 2021?"" with or without the condition I would like this question to be interpreted as follows:  Will It happen? The implied condition (if) doesnít seem to make"
55,May I Choose When It'S Delivered?,Considering this utterance: May I Choose When It'S Delivered? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? If you were asked to say the whole sentence out loud, what sounds come to mind in context to the question posed?

1) I choose when it IS delivered.
2) May you choose it when IS, or IS DELIVERED. The latter implies a second choice. That is, in fact, the implied question of your example. I don't see why the latter is not acceptable. After all, if you ask a question that starts with ""I"", you are already saying you want the choice to be YOURS. Therefore, it makes sense. In fact this kind of question is much more common than the former. For instance, we use ""When is it?"" a lot in conversation. It's not the usual ""Do you..."" type of grammar that you find in the book. This is simply a common way of asking a person's opinion. When you look back at the sentence, however, you can clearly see that the ""do"" is actually implied. Even if it wasn't, most common usage would assume it. You could say something like ""May I?"" as the equivalent of the phrase in its entirety. However, this would be more of a formal, ""asking"" statement than normal usage. And if used as part of some other sentence it would likely mean something. ""Will you pick me up at 5?""
It may simply be that ""when it is"" (as a noun) is too formal for conversation and it should always be used with a preceding question, whereas using the noun ""it"" as in ""choose it"" would not be inappropriate to a conversation (even a casual one). It might also, therefore, be the reason why some people prefer to use the verb ""will"" in situations like those."
56,I Need It Delivered On A Certain Date.,Considering this utterance: I Need It Delivered On A Certain Date. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

It’s very easy to confuse “need,” and ‘I need.“
‘Need‒to mean that a person, company, or organization has a need for something to happen or be done or to be obtained. It s also „need‟ to mean a ‚need for food and water‛ in case of a dying person.
In a sentence, ’I do not have a car. I need a vehicle to take my children to school. You need to do this and that. He needs to go to the doctor‹he needs care. She needs money. The children in Africa need food. (need)› is more often used in connection with the ‡want‡ of persons. A person that has ”a need‖ is also one that wants something in that specific case. To say ""he has no need of me‰ is to say that he doesn‚t want me. That is a statement about the person himself. This is not the same as ‹I have no desire for you′. In that case I do have desire. But I don‸t need you.  
There‥is some overlap between the two. There are many things that we need, but do want. We need them, because we like them. They are pleasurable. If the things are not there we feel frustrated. †We need friends.† We don ‰t have any friends, so we are lonely.(„The fact is, you do need it. No wonder this book is called I Have To Get You To Do It!) You are here! You have to eat. Need: to give the impression that something is necessary or important; especially in phrases like, ""I would like to see a doctor. [It is important that I see the dentist] He has to study harder. Do you have some extra work for me? I‫ need this for a test I have. His mother needed to help her husband with his work. What he needs is an education. Someone should tell him that, otherwise he will do more harm. All of us need love."" In these cases we talk about need not with a wishy washy nuance but a plain ‭‬I ‬"

What do the words in the phrase describe? What are the parts of speech used? A noun-phrase, prepositional-phrases, adverbial-adjective? Which are used as independent or dependent, or both? Where does this phrase appear in a written work? Why do you want to know that? Can a noun phrase be a complete thought? Is your answer to the first question “no,” ”yes, but ‘only’ …“? Would you expect this sentence to have more or fewer than one complete idea? (More, because a sentence is made up of clauses, and more clauses implies more ideas.) What else is implied in your question about the ’intended‘ use of this particular clause? Do you know whether to expect the full, the partial, more, less, no, etc.?
[This is an exercise, by the way, that I‚‰ve used myself to test your reading level, since this is a question I often see asked, for example, when I take the GRE reading exam, in my area. I hope this helps some of you.]

61,"Ordered Awhile Back, What Is The Eta In The Us?","Considering this utterance: Ordered Awhile Back, What Is The Eta In The Us? What is the intent that best describes it?","?

A:
There are two possibilities: (a) this is a mis-attribution from someone who misheard the words (or who didn't hear them at all); or (b) the writer meant ""what is"" to be a reference to the E, since he is obviously familiar with the notation of the English language and knows what it means to have an apostrophe after the ""t"". 
Either way: that's not a question we can definitively answer. But there's something else in this: if the author really meant question mark, he would have used it. That question would be ""What is this question about?""
I find it unlikely that the question he intended was really, ""Where is The United States of America?""  The US is usually the capital of a state, not the country, so it is not at the center of his world. Even if he was thinking about the Ural-Altaic language group, as the OP's post suggests, it might still be more likely the United Kingdom as opposed to America if it was intended as an etymological joke."

In ""How Long"", the ""For it"" has the same meaning as ""It"" and does not seem grammatically correct, or maybe there is some special meaning implied with this usage.
I also would be grateful for help in understanding how to interpret it as an ""as clause"", so that the correct pre-position can be chosen. Thanks!"
63,Whats The Delivery Time To The United States?,Considering this utterance: Whats The Delivery Time To The United States? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

In this example a verb is used and it can be said that the verb means that you ask a question. But that verb has to be a real question that requires a response to know what the answer is.
I would say this would be the meaning of the question, I have no idea the delivery time for the United Sates. I do not think that is a common phrase as it is not usually a thing you would think about. 
You can say I would like to hear the time, and I think it would make sense to say. Whats the Time to the US for this afternoon? or Whats time to this evening from the city we are in to LA? (The delivery is important here and the idea of time in general)
Is the use of a relative pronoun (Whats the Delivery time) correct with that phrase? Is it used correctly in a sentence like this. Its not in context in the above examples. So I don't think so in this case as the phrase is an example that doesn't make much sense. It would not need one as there is no time reference here. The time is known. (This could be interpreted as something that could happen in future, but the only way to do that would need a future tense and a noun phrase with a reference like that afternoon, tomorrow afternoon or later in life).
Another example, Is this a grammatically sound sentence?  I hope that someone could help me out in regards to if it makes grammatical sense and if not where I am not following the rules with it. ""Whos name is it that wrote this?""
Thanks in advanced. If you cannot explain it in simple terms I may need to see that in person. :) That was too much to ask for. Thanks for all your help and time I really appreciate it and will return the favor. Thank you and god bless

How would you describe the relationship between the subject and predicate within your sentence when it includes a preposition? For example: “To have a card” or ” To get a car“?
How can you be in your car and still have your card? What if both your cards were in the car? Is it a metaphor? Can you say that ‘a card is in my car (when I’m in it)?‘ What about the following: I have the best card, my card beats that one, I got a new card etc.

What does it all mean? I am not sure if it‟s metaphoric and what the meaning is, but it has a good ring to it. It reminds me of when my father (a former college professor) used to say: It sounds very nice. He was a retired professor. „ It ’s a pretty card. I know that is a cliche in this situation but I like it and will use it often. If you don›t like the sentence, then it needs to be rewritten. Try this:

66,When Are Cards Delivered?,Considering this utterance: When Are Cards Delivered? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? (1 point)

I was recently asked to analyze and explain a card that had been written by another student. The card said, “When are cards delivered?,” as if there were some kind of delay. I explained that when someone asks a question, it’s generally in the form of, What do you mean? This is because a person asking, when are you going to get back to me, is asking about the timing of the delivery. It seems the person who wrote this card was looking, not wanting, to receive an answer.
In this case, you would ask, When do I get my card?
The card could say,
When do cards get delivered? or
What is card delivery? If you wanted to explain when your card is going out, what might you say? The answer is, It is delivered the evening of each day on which the mailman comes to your apartment. If the card says, I‘m out of town, the answer would be, As soon as I return to the house. But if the statement is more like, The mail has not come for a week, then the response would likely be more in keeping with the question. In this situation, if you really wanted a quick answer you might say that cards go out in an average of about an hour."

I have this question because I don't really understand what I need when I say these phrases.
For instance, when you say I Have This, What do you intend? Do you mean that you have something, it might be a product or service or an event? If the phrase is short, how do I know what to do next? For instance do people normally ask what is your card, then they will give it to you? What if I asked this when someone was speaking in Chinese, do native speakers understand this? I'd like to ask other native English speaker to check what they think, and then I will ask this to my Chinese teacher. I hope I can get her opinion in answering this. Thanks for any help. 
And I am not a native speaker, if you think I might say something wrong, just tell me. My intention is to get more familiar with my native language and improve it. :)
Update: Thanks to everyone, I got the answer after I read your answers! I guess I should have been more precise, so sorry about that. Anyway, thanks for helping. Now I have many many questions to answer! Thank you all again. Thank You, David. :))
PS: Just a little side note: For a long time I only think about people to tell them that their sentences have grammar mistakes. So thanks to people who correct grammar or spelling, you gave me many chances to improve myself. You are all my teachers (or my parents) who helped me improve. ;)   :P
PPS (PS): I still don’t know if this is a grammatical issue or not. But my language teacher (in Chinese) said that this type of sentence is not grammatically right. And I think that it is wrong to say that “if I ask for something you will do it”. In my opinion, a human being will not do something that he or she doesn‘t intend to. Because a person‟s intent will always be clear in his or her mind. Therefore, this kind of statement is gramatically wrong. However, as I said before, my teacher said it was right to use this pattern in daily conversation, even if it has no logical basis..  So you are right if your answer is right, but wrong"

This is interesting. The two most common answers are probably: ""I"" and ""Me"" but I thought it worth mentioning a third one. A few years ago I was watching a movie with my family. About two-thirds of the way through, as I watched my kids (7 and 10) fall asleep, my wife and I began talking about the movie we were watching. Suddenly she turned to me and said, ""What are you waiting for?"" That was a surprise and it led us to ponder about our own waiting. So here we are. I think what you said really is right in one sense. It's a matter of what is your intention with the phrase you are saying as the one you wait for. For some it is ""me"", for others it might be ""her"", ""them"" or ""someone"".

I have always thought you were wrong to wait in your car to pick up your spouse (or anyone). I am not sure how you would react when someone was waiting by a bus stop for their spouse, for example. There are so many people waiting, waiting (in) the rain, etc. And if you can't get up out of your seat, what's the point if someone has to be sitting next to you? (And what would happen if something did finally happen... who knows what it would be!) Maybe you should wait to drive when your kids are older and can sit in the back seat by their self... then again, maybe not. Who knows? But I would have to think that waiting is not the right choice... maybe sitting by my door in my living room or at the end of my driveway waiting to come home is more appropriate? At least then you have a place to go... or don't you think? I'd just leave...

“I” is “me’ – I am the person in whom I‘m expressing the need (I am expressing a need, in fact).
The ‘need is expressed in these two ways: as an absolute need: ” as soon as possible „, or as the ‚imperative‰: „as soon‚as possible‫ . It‒s possible that the meaning of my uttering the phrase ‹I need this card› could vary depending on where I stand;
but my need is absolute‌,
and there‹s no question that I need to get this
card‡ as
soon as (as well as)
possible
; 
And the reason that it‛s an‮immediate‏  need‬ is 
because   it
is‧ ‪immediately  possible to   fulfill it   by
getting the card ‬and sending it to me;‥and in this way my ’I' will be immediately able
to get the card as‖​soon‟•as/‗possi․ble , since the
ability‭―(to get—it‐″and‑send‍it)‷  † is in
my power, so I'm able to
get it/send it as well, because I can
do it (can send it) as/as quickly as I want‼‣. I don't need anything
for this, I know that (‿I know‎that) I have this opportunity, which is so immediate and
easy; so, the only question is: when I
send (i.e.,′receive‴) it, can  I really use it in‵the way that
it says,  on this page, and in line with the information
that it says? So what the matter is about it that needs my card so

76,When Will My Card Arrive?,Considering this utterance: When Will My Card Arrive? What is the intent that best describes it?,", such as:

I want/need to know when the card will arrive at my home.
When will the check arrive?
Will we have the report by 2 P.M.?
How long is my trip? How does that work? Can you tell me in a few words? 
What time do you finish work, and will you pick me up after work today, or this evening? What does it mean?"
77,Can I Choose A Date For Delivery?,Considering this utterance: Can I Choose A Date For Delivery? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The speaker wants to convey: The date on which he intends to pick up the delivery.
If the speaker was asked to say it: I am to choose a date for the courier to deliver to you in a particular time zone, he would say:
I Can Choose a Date for Delivery. If we were to use an imperative to express the same: ""You Should choose the date"".
So, the first sentence expresses the intention in the past time, while the second sentence would express it in future time. Can you make the distinction clear by using the appropriate tense? 
Thank you for your consideration."
78,Can I Make Sure My Card Is Delivered On A Specific Day?,Considering this utterance: Can I Make Sure My Card Is Delivered On A Specific Day? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

You may consider these as being two examples of the same type of utterances, with similar meaning as one. If you were to write an essay about each as an exercise, it would be more clear what the focus should be, as well as what you know about your own writing style."
79,Can I Have It Be Delivered At A Certain Time?,Considering this utterance: Can I Have It Be Delivered At A Certain Time? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

What is your first thought or impression? I'm sure it depends on your background, but for the majority it might be: 
I'm confused.
That seems like an easy thing to answer. It seems almost like a single word, so you think to yourself 'I Am, It Is, This Is What We Need'.  It is a very broad question and I think the answer is 'Yes and No'.
The intent could be anything:
Can't be delivered. There is no way to know the time without it already being a set time. So if I could only know when it will be at a certain point, there's no possible way it could not be. (There are no options)   You could know there is an issue, you know what time it's gonna be, however you can't know it is. You are still waiting.  Or the option is to give you a warning and you would know ahead of time that you don't have the choice if it happens. Like if you said ""it's in 5 minutes"". So you are waiting, waiting for it to be '5 minutes'. In this case there are many possibilities of what the sentence can mean. This might not make sense, I might have it wrong. But I believe it has more of a question in it then a yes or no answer, and more likely to have one of these. And I know this is probably a little confusing, my goal is just to help others better understand how to word such a statement. I was just reading this: How can I answer a simple question without sounding like I don’t actually know how it works? and it helped me explain the question better."

81,I Can'T Get My Card To Work.,Considering this utterance: I Can'T Get My Card To Work. What is the intent that best describes it?,"? 

A:
This question can be easily answered.
First look at the different parts of Speech of each word. I, Can and My.  And then look up the definition of the word in the dictionary for both the verbs to see what they mean and see if we can determine which meaning is closer to the phrase that you have given. The first part of speech for each words will be a noun and the second will will either be verb or preposition, etc. So for instance, the first word ""I"" has a pronoun as its last part and so the verb tense for this part will likely be present (present tense) rather than past (past continuous). The second word, ""Can"" is a verb, hence it will use the infinitive tense in this phrase, namely, can. This makes ""can't"" mean that the action in which I am doing at this time could not be completed in its current state."

The following are examples of phrases that would make a good topic for an online article.
A. A common way to refer to something that doesn’t work as expected or does not function as needed. For example, you may have a new laptop, and it just doesn't work. You might say, ""It appears that my laptop didn't hook up.""
B. An uttering that indicates that you don't understand how something works. Perhaps you have an old car, but you want to upgrade to a newer model. How do you know that it's a better car? How would you fix it? You can say ""I don‘t understand why my car” has an issue, or ""How can I fix my broken car?""
C. Describes something you“ve been thinking about or doing. It„' may be about your own thoughts or actions or your thoughts about something about someone else."" You may say “I've been considering moving to San Francisco.‚"" or „I have had a lot to think about."" Or you can simply say something like ""My wife has been trying to convince me to go to Hawaii. I haven't decided. My mother-in-law has also been talking about going there, too."" Another example of a ""thinking about doing something"" phrase is to say you ‘""have been working out and am thinking of going to the gym to work out more."" For a more formal example see ‪[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_about_doing something]
D. To explain a concept to someone. ""He explained it to me."" or '""When my father- in- law told me what a computer was, I didn‟t know what to make of him."" A more direct expression of the same idea is ""Explain that to him!""
E. If you are not sure about how to accomplish a task, this is also a useful tool for you.

found this helpful. The one I would have chosen is ""The thing I just told him to do is wrong, and I'm really angry about it""
In the first example there is no clear intention in mind. ""I'm sure he'll understand"" or ""If I were you I'd understand""...
""How do I know why my card isn't working?"" is like: I don't know, but I could find out if I wanted to.
As to the second example. I agree with the two examples you cited. It's a simple question to ask but it's also a question with which we could be quite surprised that we don' think of it as having a single meaning but that it actually depends on the context in which it is said. To be honest, I think the reason it depends so much on context, is that sometimes there are more important things going on, even if our intentions are always good. And I believe most people would choose the same answer if they were really honest."
84,My Card Broke.,Considering this utterance: My Card Broke. What is the intent that best describes it?,"? 

A:
I think we agree here, this is a simple and direct statement of facts.  It's short but doesn't really need elaboration.
But we can still elaborate with the following examples:   (1) my car broke into pieces, meaning my vehicle (or parts thereof) fell into many pieces as if it had been smashed; (2) you broke my heart, or you cut out my soul; or (3) the doctor broke his leg."
85,My Card Won'T Work.,Considering this utterance: My Card Won'T Work. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I'm guessing: 
a. ""the intent was expressed""
b. '""my card won't work"" is an accurate statement about the past, which is why the statement is a fact'
c. This is ambiguous because the speaker doesn't care enough to state his intent.
d. I'm just guessing and not sure.   But I've never heard someone ask ""Is my statement accurate?"" before and it would seem to be pretty ambiguous. Perhaps ""can you explain me why?"" is better suited?  Or maybe, ""Why?""
If anyone understands what I mean by this question, I'd love to hear. Thanks for your help. :)  I know it's very difficult to explain to the general public. But hopefully the people here will know the answer, even if I don't. Thank you. : )
Edit: I just had a very enlightening experience with this. A person came into my office to make a purchase. My employee said that 'the customer's card will not work', and they tried to purchase something on the Internet. We had to take the information down a few times, and the sales people kept trying to tell her that her card worked, but she was not impressed. She insisted repeatedly that it didn't and that the 'customer service line' didn’t work. It turns out, that this same customer had made several prior purchases in person, on her phone, at our other stores with the card. Only now, the online store didn""t recognize her. The customer service phone line is only supposed to support credit cards, not debit. When we looked at the receipts, they all had the same type of 'card' and 'number' printed in the corner, so this customer didn'nt know how to read and understand them. After talking to her for awhile, it turned out that she had never made a debit purchase or used the phone in all the years she lived in this state, nor had she made any purchases on credit at all. Her card was in her purse and she never gave it to anybody for any purpose. So, after looking at her receipt, we were able to find some other person whose card had been in that purse, who had purchased a lot of things with it, over a number of years, with her permission, until the purse was lost."

The answer is:

My card (not) works

No one ever explained this to me. (The speaker is looking at a piece of paper or a screen. There is no audience)
Something went wrong and now my (card, not) isn't working
It is not clear or unknown
Why am I not using the card? (A person uses a card and it fails to be accepted or it is lost or there is an issue with the user or something else)

87,Can You Please Identify The Problem With My Bank Card?,Considering this utterance: Can You Please Identify The Problem With My Bank Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"(and not as many words)? It seems to me that the phrase expresses the same intent and the speaker has the exact same attitude and state of mind.

I know I can’t use this as an argument that I”m right. Rather I think that, in some contexts, I could, but in others, it wouldn‘t. If I say it out loud, the context determines whether or not I would be understood as expressing the intention behind my words. In an e-mail, or a conversation in a room full of people, if I were to say the sentence without the word please and a raised index finger, then the statement might be perceived as threatening because it would sound like an ultimatum. But in one-to one communication, such as in echating, a business meeting or an interview, my statement could be interpreted positively as being inquisitive and helpful, as is clearly implied by the raised fist and word of please. I don‚Äôt know of any context in which I wouldn't sound threatening and yet, depending on the listener, would clearly be intended as help."

89,My Card Does Not Work,Considering this utterance: My Card Does Not Work What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I would like to have the answer to this question explained with reference to the following questions:
-Is there a difference between this phrase and other similar phrases? If yes, why is this specific phrase chosen among them? (I'm specifically interested in the differences because I think these differences could also be applied to other phrases in English.)
(Please also include the reason for any differences or explanations.) I believe that, like with all phrases, there are specific phrases or expressions that have a specific meaning that are meant for the specific situation. I'm just unable to figure out which one is that particular phrase.
This question also applies to phrases that you can say for other purposes but do not actually mean it, such as ""I wish"", ""It's my card."", etc. Please explain them as well. 
In order to determine whether or not this is a general question, please consider this: The answer should be a sentence or a short phrase to indicate the meaning. The meaning does not need to include everything, just the most important parts. Thank you in advance for your answer. And, of course, let me know if you need further clarification. :D
Please note that although this language might seem to be specific to Japan, I am interested more in this particular example as an example to explain to others. :)
PS: I already saw some answers on this site but I wasn't really satisfied. Thanks for reading and I hope you get my point. Anyways, you are welcome to correct or clarify any points.

92,Help Me.  My Card Doesn'T Work.,Considering this utterance: Help Me.  My Card Doesn'T Work. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
There are four different things to consider here. One is simply the grammatical sentence. Another is whether it's a request for help. In that sense, you are right. It means ""Help me with my card."" The third is to what person you're asking for assistance. That's why ""I need help with this card"" is different. Finally, the fourth, and last, is which particular help you need and why. There's more going on with the last than I will show you right now, but the following will be helpful. The way you phrase it is very important to be understood. What you choose as the question word ""how"" determines what you will get in most cases. For example, I would guess your friend has a problem with her card reader because ""How do I put the card in?"" is asking how she can put a card into her reader, while ""Why don't you put your card on the reader"" may be asking why she should put her credit card anywhere.
The first step here is that you want to get the sentence into its simplest form possible so the next logical step is ""What is my problem?"" If you don’t ask this, no one will know what card you mean or why you‘re looking for a fix. Now you get to pick a way to phrase the problem. Let's start with ""my card doesn't work."" There are many variations of this statement. Some have ""card"", ""reader"", etc. in place of ""doesn't"", making the statement ""the reader (or card ) does not work"". Some use ""it"" (my reader or card) but ""is"" would be correct. We could have: It won't (work), I can't read (it) or something less common, ""My card won‟t work.” This means that the way I ask for this help is: ""Does it (reader or credit) card (do not) work?"" You can see that there is a lot of room for interpretation based on context. You get two things with that phrase: how the person is going to fix your reader and your credit. A simple ""fix"" means they will try to figure out a solution to your problem but they may not know why it has stopped working. They may have no idea"
93,Can A Card Stop Working?,Considering this utterance: Can A Card Stop Working? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

94,I Think My Card Is Broken,Considering this utterance: I Think My Card Is Broken What is the intent that best describes it?,"? If you thought about the uttering, do you think it was a genuine declaration, or an expression used in jest? (“Ha! That’s funny! My card is broken, but I didn‘t have any intention of saying it!”) If your gut is saying the latter, you are probably a native American.

In our everyday language, we use phrases such as “I think,‚„ „He thinks, ‚´I don‟t think‌, etc.‰³ We also use the expression  ‏I can‬  think of something, and it ' s very  common‏ and quite‡ common, so it shouldn 't be surprising to find it in your mother tongue‥‹ (that was the only reason).
But in our mother tongues, there are expressions that describe thinking as:
(1) a way of thinking
a) I think that...
b) He thinks that the... etc.,
c) We think/think that that/those   are... (plural)
2) A state of mind
I feel that / feel / think / (feel + think) that 
3) An emotion
‒ I‍ ‬think ‌that / ‍think /‭ (think/feel) ‎that
The thing is, the  above expressiones are all verbs, while I was talking about thinking, as in the meaning of a thought expressed by an act of the mind, such that one thinks of or thinks to think. In order to give you an idea, let me give an example of each of these expressions: ††
Expression A  I am thinking of
expression c  We feel like  That is what we think
We have also expressions in Spanish that are used to describe the thinking process, e.g  ‘I am  thinking ‎ of  (to think something) .  But I believe that this use of preposition in this case is incorrect."
95,Why Isn'T My Card Working?,Considering this utterance: Why Isn'T My Card Working? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
I don't think the original poster intended this as an answer to the question but rather was attempting a demonstration.
What this person is saying is: ""Because I said so"".
But there's nothing in the sentence structure to indicate you intended that meaning. In addition, it seems you're trying to use the ""you"" to imply he is you and that is an issue that can be addressed with a simple pronoun swap. You can't imply a person was you when it has been clearly stated that you were not him nor her. It makes more sense to change ""I"" so it would be: 
So I don’t think there was any intent of the OP using “Because”. Instead it was a poorly formed attempt of demonstrating a different solution/workaround to a problem he was having."
96,My Card Isn'T Working Anymore.,Considering this utterance: My Card Isn'T Working Anymore. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

In other words, what is a complete phrase? If I were asked what the following phrase means: The Card is Not Working. How would you answer? Is the Card a singular noun or a plural noun and do you choose an appropriate noun form? (A card, cards, a card)
If I was asked to answer, I would answer card is plural because the word is referring to both a single piece of plastic that is used as money and currency as well as the concept of ""cards"" or ""playing cards"" of this game or that game; a person might also use the term card game to refer to the cards that are used in this sort of game.
However, another answer that might be given is that the card isn't working because more than one person is using the one piece to spend. However, in that case the person wouldn't be spending money from the same card (I would guess) and the plural use of the noun ""card"" would be a reference to different cards than the piece used by the other person. If you use ""a"" before the ""c"" and then the singular form of card and don't say anything about the fact that it's the only piece, then it would refer only to one card. (In my opinion.)
Is the sentence that one is not working as intended correct? How is one's response? Why? What are the pros and cons between a more correct way of saying it? 
(For this question, it matters what ""the"" actually refers to or is understood to in context. I've seen ""The card"" which makes me wonder about that.)"
97,My Card Was Declined Today When Eating And I Need To Know What'S Wrong.,Considering this utterance: My Card Was Declined Today When Eating And I Need To Know What'S Wrong. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

Intonation: rising at the end, then falling, with slight pauses in between.
Fluency: Not fluent at all. A few words were repeated or said with a slight pause. Some are said as if someone is talking too fast for the listener to follow. This may be more evident than with other dialects. There was no indication of an emphasis on any part of the phrase. No stammering or hesitation, and nothing that could be perceived as being out of place. 
Grammar:  It used a very small fraction of grammar with very few, if any, errors, but there was a lack of use of proper sentence structure and there were some words that were very strange for their meaning that had a lot of meaning for them. It was also extremely informal. (I don't think I'm allowed to say anything more than this..)
Syntax: There were only a few instances in the whole phrase that there wasn't a clear meaning of what was to be said. The few errors in grammar were just a result of how the sentence was being said, not because of it being a non-fluent form of English. I can't really think of any reason why syntax could affect speech, other than the meaning not being clear. But that's not really an issue, since there isn't anything wrong with the grammar. If anything, this makes it even more difficult. All it tells me is how formal or casual you're going to sound based on the way you say words. As to what the problem might be, that just depends on interpretation of context. Sometimes, you can say things without knowing that they actually made any sense. So it's hard to narrow down the reason to only one of these things."

100,My Actual Card Isn'T Working.,Considering this utterance: My Actual Card Isn'T Working. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

If you have no clue, this question may seem a bit complicated. It was designed for a certain purpose: to help you see how difficult it is, to express your thoughts into a sentence (or two or more), in a way that others comprehend easily (and quickly).
So, the answer is:
Answer: This phrase means I am trying to do something that isn' t working.
And it was not only an answer of the person who wrote this (but, rather, an average person, someone who is not an English teacher), but, also, a pretty simple answer. This person knows very well how to communicate. However, that's where the problem lies: it's too simple, too basic. To me, it seems like this person doesn' thave any imagination, they were only thinking of this phrase. (If we had another phrase like ""This phrase (sentence) does not work"", we would've probably gotten much better results.)
Let's get back to ""My Actual card Isn't Working"".
I don't understand this sentence. If I knew how this works, I wouldn' have to ask a question. Let's try to figure it out. Well, if we are lucky, and if your card has problems with the security system, you may be forced to enter a new password. So, what is that new (password) and what are you trying? What exactly doesn't work? If you still don' know (what doesn',t work), maybe this can help. In this case, let's ask for something you can' try. You are trying a password that already exists in your system's database. Perhaps you entered it too much time ago. Or, maybe, somebody found it before you and used it. The point is to understand: ""You are not being able to get into your computer."" 
Well, then, ""What is it that this password does?"" We are still trying that password, but the computer says ""Hey, something isn't right with it."" So what exactly is wrong? There is a problem with your security settings on the website. For sure, your password is good (correct, strong, long, etc.), so, we should look for any problem on your browser's security setting page. There can be multiple problems to consider. But in the end, only your imagination"
101,Is My Card Broken?,Considering this utterance: Is My Card Broken? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

This is a very common problem. I see it on a weekly basis. We all want to believe that what we experience is just coincidence. If we think about it, the odds of a string of events being just mere coincidence are incredibly slim. It doesn't really matter that you are not a numerology or clairvoyant, because your observations will not be any different. That is, unless you have an extraordinary mind, then you may be able to perceive beyond what is being displayed on paper.
If we were to make an assumption, one could make the assumption that it represents: My life is broken. Or maybe: The life I have is not mine. Whatever the case may may; we want our card not to be broken, to not fail. This is very similar to the human nature desire to keep things that we like. For example, a person could own a car that has some issues that were not disclosed to them, and then they drive it all the time, never fixing it. They do not want it to fail because they feel like they will never get a new one because the car is already broken for them. In essence, they are saying: This vehicle is going to die, I am going let it die because to me it does not matter. My only concern is that the money I spent on the last one I had does no good. So, we feel the need to hold on to something that represents our life's circumstances. The only thing that is left to do is to change the outcome. When we change that outcome by changing ourselves, that becomes our new car. Once we do that, all is well and life can start over again. Now, you can say:
""The universe is my car"", ""The life force is me"", or maybe ""I am the energy"", to explain the concept of you. Everything is in you, therefore: Your life, your car, or your energy. However you want too, just as long as you realize that your life does in fact matter and the universe does too. You may think that this is silly. Yet, when we realize what has happened and what to expect from it; that our reality is based on how we have chosen to handle it in the past...it is then that life becomes easier because we are then in control."
102,I Broke My Card,Considering this utterance: I Broke My Card What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I am pretty certain that I cannot think of a single answer that would encompass the entire span of human communication, but, for the sake of conversation, let's say that intent is ""intentional communication.""
The answer would likely be:
""I""
(because it describes a human subject who acts intentionally)
+
the verb
(""broke"" because it is not an intransitive verb in this context) 
with an adverb  or modifier to modify the verb (""intentionally"").
That would be it.
But this question is about phrases, so I am wondering if there is any additional way to describe such a usage of intent in a short phrase.  Or, if not, what is its opposite. (For example, to say something like ""I have no intent to do it""). Maybe a way of saying it would consist just of two nouns and a verb; for example ""To say I'm going to break my card (card)"" would not be incorrect; but I can't think how you could describe that with one phrase instead of four words. If someone told me that was a valid way I would have to explain to them why. ""Intent"" is a word. I guess I think a person who breaks their word has to be intending to hurt others. So I'd say: Intent to not do the action. But that feels like a really long explanation to add a few words to a four-word sentence. And I know that people can be very concise with their speech. Maybe I just have a terrible memory. Any thoughts? Thanks. :)
Edit
One more attempt: If I say ""The purpose was to (verb) the (adjective) of my intention"". I suppose it could be interpreted that way - and I could even say it was intended in an abstract sense, even if I didn't mean it as such. In practice I use this kind of thing a lot. For example: ""His goal was not to kill me, only to get me to admit to something."" If he was doing that just for his own amusement, as he claimed, then I don't understand that as an attempt. On the other hand, I might be the one who intended to confess that it wasn't really my fault. The way he phrased ""to get to the real reason for my actions"""
103,My Card Stopped Working,Considering this utterance: My Card Stopped Working What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

1- The phrase expresses a negative intent. The person does not want others to know that he has a Card Not Present transaction problem.
If this intent were expressed in three or four words, it would be a stronger expression:
My Card stopped working.

Just saw that I was the first to respond to this question so maybe I should add this: I do not want my mom to get mad. My kids would get hurt. Their dad and step-dad have a good relationship with my parents. They are just my husband's parents, so it is not like they are a huge part of our family. He and his dad talk about things like this all the time and they don't get offended. For example, he was just telling me his car had died on him and we were talking about getting a new one. When he told his mom, she told him to have his mechanic look at it before he went to work. His dad told her that he thought it should be taken to the garage but my dad said it was fine and he should just try to push it a little bit and it would start.

107,I Can'T Use My Card.,Considering this utterance: I Can'T Use My Card. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?
This is a real life situation and I don' want to know what to do.
I want answers that explain the usage of the words ""to"" and ""can'"" or ""I can't"" in this situation. Also if you are answering, please try to keep it short and simple. My english is not good enough to understand the explanations of more elaborated words.  

A:
If you cannot understand anything I said after you read it, you did not understand what I meant. Sorry :(
Edit: To help you understanding what people mean when they write things like I can... or I cannot... you might want (but not necessarily need) to get a thesaurus. You can look up different words that mean the same thing and see if one is better than another for the situation at hand."
108,Need Help With My Card. It'S Not Working.,Considering this utterance: Need Help With My Card. It'S Not Working. What is the intent that best describes it?,"? And what is this card supposed to express? The words, ""Need Help? It's Not Workin?""

Now, what if you added a little twist to that statement. Let's say you had a ""special"" request.. one that you wanted to have answered. Perhaps you need a card that can speak for you. And, when you give it as your request, you could add, I would like this to be answered on Monday. Would you be willing to do that and get your special request met? If you said, Yes, then I can see why it works for a person that's dealing or has a difficult situation.
If on the other hand, if I said to you, Would You Be Willing to Give Me Help on Thursday or Tuesday or Sunday, it seems that would be too much to ask of you on a day that doesn't work for your convenience. Now, how does that work? When it comes to getting people to work together and do something you may need, there's often a difference of opinion, or even an expectation of some of the people involved. If the person you ask wants to help you and has some time available, they might be able to get things to where you want them. However, If they have no time to spare, no matter how much you plead for their help, things may be just going to go the way they want to, so to speak. You have to decide if what will be of more benefit to your situation: asking somebody for help who may have some, even if short amount of time, and having it done in a timely manner OR asking a lot of people for time for nothing. That's the conundrum you're dealing with!
And to make matters more difficult, many people, in this situation don't know if they will have time on certain days and are unsure about the time frame. They need you to figure out that time period and give them the best day for them to accomplish your needs. This may or may not be difficult for the individual to find a time that works to everyone's benefit. What's important in determining what time workable for each party is, is to look at the situation and see what would work best for getting it accomplished. For example.. If it took a week of Monday, Tuesday, Friday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday or sund"

111,My Card Isn'T Working,Considering this utterance: My Card Isn'T Working What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

This may help: This site's Help Pages provide guidance about the meaning and intent of utterances. They provide definitions for uttering a word or phrase, a sentence, or a paragraph to communicate your thoughts and feelings, and they provide examples of the utteration that illustrate the intended meaning.
In this case, the context would make clear what the speaker was trying to convey. That's why I provided the word choice ""intended,"" above. 
But to summarize:
Your question about ""My"" and ""Card"" are a bit confusing, because ""card"" is already a specific object, which makes your question somewhat unclear. ""I"" can be substituted, though, just as ""my"" means ""belonging to me."" I'd suggest using ""this/this one,"" ""these/these ones,"" and/or ""those."""
112,My Card Suddenly Quit Working.,Considering this utterance: My Card Suddenly Quit Working. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

(1) This is my card. (2) You have just ruined my whole day.
Both of the sentences above can be rewordinged to mean: “This is what is happening.” And, I think all these rewrites are equally appropriate! I will show you in this blog why:
• ‘This’ doesn‘t have much meaning. It is just referring to the item, ”this card“. Therefore, you can omit it. In your examples, it doesn`t refer to something else but something already happened. This implies that it refers to that which happened (card is destroyed = it suddenly stops working; the situation happened).
‫
However, if the ’situation‬‭is‚‪the›‌‹object ​of‏​the sentence‡‮„ ‖ then ‒the ‭object-less‟ reword would not‰ be grammatically correct. Because „a‛ is required when an object is omitted. That is, without ‛―a,′  the omission is‱ a mistake. Also, that‧ is not necessary in sentences that start with the pronoun ‫This.´ Therefore:‎ ‡ ‪(※‷‍)／
In short,
It is OK to omit ‹this object ‬when  the subject is a pronoun, like: He said, They said. Or, the subject of a sentence is already implied by the word that comes before the object. As an example: I told him that. The word ‟I․…implicitly‣ refers both to  me‗ and to him. ‚That is, he‑, because the noun after the verb is ※an  implied‵subject, which means there is only one possible answer, and this one is he. So, to avoid ambiguity or a misunderstanding, don‥​•take into‿‴″consider’� that, as you might‽‸have †been— told by your teacher. Remember"

The intent of the phrase is to communicate that one is a customer and is seeking a refund for one of several reasons, perhaps because the credit card is too old or has become invalid. 
Is this a good question or is it too vague and open ended?   Is there a better phrase or phrase set we could use? How would the question be best modified if the sentence structure did not convey what we want in the original version? Any help or direction from the community would be appreciated.
Here is how one commenter replied:
""The question asks, for a one-word phrase, the best intent for this sentence:  I have tried to use my card several times and it does not work."", which is essentially a request for which intent, if any, should best describe the following sentence? Is it best to say ""It does""? Should it be stated as ""My card does"", ""The card has"" or ""I have found that my credit/debit card/bank account does.""  ""it does"" might not be the right word, but what word would best communicate to the intended audience what is being sought? ""has/did"" is also unclear to me, since the context makes it seem as if it should say something like, ""my card, which I am currently using, does/has not"".  Please advise. Thanks!""

(a) I have my card; so do you.(b) That card does not work here.(c) We don't do card transactions here.'
The correct answer is 'c' but I don’t really know why. What makes this an answer, I guess, is that 'b' seems to imply that the thing described is real and present. I suppose this makes sense if the transaction described in 'a' is happening at that moment (and perhaps 'd') but is it a valid way of thinking? And it may be the case that this is an example of a double negation or some such thing? Maybe the phrase is a way, if there is such a thing, to say something similar to 'there's no smoke without fire'.
Also, as the correct word is not used in the question, how would I go about finding the answer? I'm assuming the word 'card' would be used.
I should also add that as I've been thinking on this, the reason why I chose to ask it on here instead of my own homework site is because it seems that, for some reason, my question has been voted down as being not constructive. Perhaps this has more to do with the fact that I haven't actually answered it myself. If this happens to be a good reason for asking it here, then I would very much like to know what exactly is wrong with it. As I said, perhaps I am not thinking about it correctly but that doesn't mean my way is incorrect, it just means I need to think about the issue in a different way.

121,I Can'T Find My Card And Think It May Have Been Stolen.,Considering this utterance: I Can'T Find My Card And Think It May Have Been Stolen. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
This can be a tricky one, because in some respects it is just a word salad. However, it has some interesting implications. To start with, the person says that they have found their card and yet cannot remember where they left it. They have a strong belief that the card is somewhere (or was) on the floor, so they are looking around for it, and that's when they think it may have been taken. There are three things that are going on here: the first is an implied ""here"" in the sentence, but without an article: ""I can't remember if it was here on my desk or..."" The second is a question: ""...and think that it might have..."" (as in a ""maybe"") and the third is that this may refer to something other than a single card.
As to the phrase itself, there was a time (before computers and phones with apps, etc.) when people would have to carry around a card on them at all times: a credit card, a driver's license, some sort of personal identification, you name it: people had to have something to show the authorities or someone else to prove who they were.  So it's perfectly understandable that someone would find their ID and not know where it happened to go. The idea is something like, ""You left your ID card in such and such place. And now you are searching for your card around here so you can prove that your name is such..."" But again, like many language problems, in this case it can come across as just someone being a pain in your butt. I'd say it fits in somewhere between that and ""you are a terrible person"". But it could just be someone not giving a damn."

You will hear from the merchant you can‘t use your credit card. They will try to get your debit card to help you out. It“s possible that you may be able to use a debit. card that hasn„t been used yet. You‟re asked for the 16 digit number on the back or on your signature on a charge card statement in order to charge a purchase with your card and have the money go into the credit line you have in place. However, the debit cards are usually used for ATM transactions, and it‚s much more convenient to have a credit to ATM card, so don‡t let this stop you from buying what you want, but it can be an issue. Make sure you understand your terms. For example, your bank may have an ATM fee for debit transactions that can only be paid using your checking account. Your statement may say something like: The amount in your account is below the amount of this transaction. To avoid this, don't let your cash flow drop below your minimum balance. Pay your bill on time and don'! t carry a balance with you. Don'I let it build up. Also, you could be charged a late fee if you don! 't pay for more than 30 days. If you are charged this fee and are unable to pay the minimum monthly payment on any of your charges, or you carry any amount due on late fees, it could put you in collections. Some companies can also put liens against your property (the property you live or work in) to enforce the payment. And, if your car is repossessed and sold, there could also be a loss. How Does a Lien Work with a Car? When you buy a car, most times, someone signs a note (a contract) with the car dealership or bank saying they will pay a set amount for a period of time. When that time is done, they have to return their car to the dealership and pay what they owe. But, when a lien is placed on their property and the ler's"

126,Oh No!  I Lost My Card!  Help!,Considering this utterance: Oh No!  I Lost My Card!  Help! What is the intent that best describes it?,"?
To me, it seems the phrase is not being used as an expression of urgency or as some kind of complaint.  There may even be a sense that it is an admission of guilt.
I'm curious to know how this phrase came to be and if it's grammatically correct. (And yes, I realize we should always use punctuation with compound sentences!)

A:
As an example, when you are talking to someone, you may say ""Hey, where are you going?"", ""I'll be right down."" Or ""Coming!"", ""On my way!"".
When you answer with ""Oh no!"", this does not sound that you really don't care, but you say that this is something you will soon do. This is a typical sentence used."
127,"I Believe My Card Has Been Stolen, What Can I Do About This Situation? It'S Urgent.","Considering this utterance: I Believe My Card Has Been Stolen, What Can I Do About This Situation? It'S Urgent. What is the intent that best describes it?","?

Answer: A. The first thing to say is ""I think I know who's done this."" Because if you say it in this way, it seems to be very direct, you are more likely to find out the truth of who did it right away.
""My card has been stolen,"" is like a general statement in which you don' t have to specify the thief. This could be a very general situation. ""My car is stolen"", ""my house is broken into"". Here the subject is not specified. But when you specify someone like who has stolen your car, this will make it easier for you to determine the situation of your own. (If you suspect) ""It was my friend who stole it.""
When you express your feeling in a sentence such as these: ""Who's stolen my card?"", or ""How did my house been broken in to?"" etc., there comes a situation where they are both the same in that they want to know the reason of their losses. However, they have a different way of expression or a way to make a demand, or to ask for help. In these case you have two different feelings at the end of a certain situation that you want it to clear up or it' has happened. And you need to express them in their own ways to understand each other better. 
The first step is to think about it like this. Do not make your friends or family feel you' have lost your patience. Because in the long run you will lose your friend or your family by not being clear. You need first to figure out what it is that bothers you. Then it will be easier to get them to see and understand your way. Also remember that when someone has made a mistake or something has gone wrong for your benefit, the first place to start is with understanding the person you made the request. So be patient, and try to avoid any unnecessary comments. After all, if your card was stolen for something, then your first goal is probably to have it back!
You' will need a lot of patience because in some cases, your partner or friend may not say exactly what they mean to you, so it can help to try it out in your mind what you think he or she is trying to communicate. If this doesn' help"
128,Help! Someone Stole My Card!,Considering this utterance: Help! Someone Stole My Card! What is the intent that best describes it?,"?
It is clear that the speaker intends to communicate this information with a sentence fragment as an answer to the ""help"" question of someone.
Help!Someone stole my card!

In this case the question is not the same, but it is a different meaning to ask ""Are you the person who stole the card?"". It's a ""What did you do?"".
However the answer is Yes! The person stole your card!.
The other possible answer of ""Yes"" means ""I know I did and I am going to tell you."". I know and am telling you that I stole it and that you should contact the local police. You are not going anywhere near me at this moment in time or I will call the police and have you arrested! I do not have time to be wasting on your petty concerns."
129,Help.  I Have A Stolen Card!,Considering this utterance: Help.  I Have A Stolen Card! What is the intent that best describes it?,"?
I've been struggling to come up with a single word for this but haven't succeeded.

A:
There is no such single English word that I know of and I doubt one exists. ""Help"" might cover your intent if you're trying to help someone recover a stolen card; or it might refer to an external entity trying help; etc., depending on context. So you might say ""Let me help you"", but if we wanted to be precise about intent, we'd say, ""I want to give you some help.""  
As for ""stolen"", the verb ""lose"" could convey the general sense of ""taken"", or the preposition could be dropped altogether and replaced by ""take away from someone"". If we want the latter, then ""Have you lost your...?"" would be appropriate."

131,How Do I Report My Card Stolen?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Report My Card Stolen? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Is it a declarative utterence? How about a question?

To me, this sentence can be read as two separate statements: ""How do I report my card stolen?"" and ""What is my first priority in this situation?"".
So I would read it as an imperative.
I am a native-English speaker and I believe that the most grammatical interpretation would have:
""how do you report your card is stolen""
This is because the sentence is asking for how something is done. It is not asking a specific question. The sentence ""how to report a card""? sounds weird to me. Maybe we can use ""what"": ""a) How I can report this?""
Now ""Which is more appropriate?"" is probably the wrong way to phrase that question, because I think it is actually a statement: it describes a condition. If that's the way you want to go, then the best sentence would probably be:


How can I determine if my credit card has been stolen?"
132,My Card Is Gone I Think It Was Stolen,Considering this utterance: My Card Is Gone I Think It Was Stolen What is the intent that best describes it?,"? (Note: if you need a more specific description of any type of intent, ask your friend to explain it to you) 
a) to tell my card has been lost/stolen?
b) I'm sorry. Someone stole my credit card?   (No I did not lose it, it was stolen )
Which sentence does best express that intent? a) or b)?  Please include a brief reason why.

A:
The answer of your question:  ""Which one of the following two sentences best expresses that ""My card is gone, I think it  was  stolen""? :  I would go with the 1st one.  It is much easier and I find it more natural to understand it from the context of ""It was lost, and then was found stolen"".  That sentence  is very easy to parse and to grasp. It also does not have a very difficult verb ""steal"" that will cause much difficulty in understanding, unlike ""was stolen"", where the word has multiple meanings and thus is easily misinterpreted."
133,Is A Copy Of The Police Report Necessary For Completing The Report Process?,Considering this utterance: Is A Copy Of The Police Report Necessary For Completing The Report Process? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A. to provide for a complete accounting of an accident incident
B. a means of documenting the event
C. necessary for completion of the report
D. required by the police
Answers:
The answer is: D
This is correct. The word: necessary
is used to describe the act of doing a thing. In this case, it is used in the same sense that the word ""required"" is in your English grammar course, which is not to use the actual word necessary or not, but the way in which the language is being used. It is also a synonym for: to be necessary; be required
In this context: The purpose of this report is to give a thorough account of what happened. A complete account is necessary to do that.
Now, if it were the case that you were asked by a judge to complete a court report, for example, the court clerk would use more of a: be useful to the judge, etc. type of language and not ""the report process"" language."

135,How Do I Deal With A Stolen Card?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Deal With A Stolen Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? The following examples can help you identify this intent:
* ""How Do You Deal?""

This is a direct request for a description or answer to a question.
It can also be used to describe something. If the word ""deal"" is used as ""What is that?"" it means ""how do you describe (it)?"" The phrase can be in a conversational tone. ""Deal"" has several uses: a noun for cards, as in poker: ""what do I play?"", as an adjective: ""...is it a good deal?"" ""As for you, deal.""
Example: My husband and I are buying a table saw. We have been looking at the various models. I have heard you guys talk about this table a lot. How did you choose it?
Answer: I know you have seen our table, but what do YOU think, ""Is it good?"" (i.e. do these models compare favorably to the others you saw?)
(Note: the ""you guys"" in this conversation refer to us and to other customers as you discuss the table).
The answer could be a brief and neutral ""That table is very nice"" or ""It is in the same price range as your others."" Or they can say, with a bit of humor, ""... It's nice that you liked it."" The answer depends on how much they care about our opinion. (We do get some of the details wrong from time to time.)
""The other day, it was in that sale, and we were looking for...""
If they start their sentence with ""The"", it usually means they are giving background information, such as what they had been doing in preparation for the purchase, or what happened during the last sale. They are describing something that happened earlier and they want to explain to you the connection of things. The ""the"" can mean they were talking to someone else, they saw what was going and wanted to tell you what it meant. But it might be that they heard about something, something you said or that some event or something happened. This way they explain what is going on. Sometimes there is humor in it, for example ""We were on our way home from a business meeting, when we saw..."", a light hearted way of saying they arrived home late because they took their time after the meeting. Or"
136,Can You Freeze My Card It Was Stolen,Considering this utterance: Can You Freeze My Card It Was Stolen What is the intent that best describes it?,"? If you think about this question, and I suspect you will, if you are not already familiar with this phrase, the answer is: The phrase as one of two-word phrases can be considered: a statement – It was stolen, I think this can best describe the meaning of the phrase: an inquiry – Can you freeze my card?, an expression – What a bummer, this is terrible!, or as part of a sentence, – This card has been stolen!

The last question I will consider is this example: How can I freeze or cancel my credit card? Here we can consider a number of different answers, for example, as the speaker of this statement: as an affirmation: the card is frozen, or I can have it canceled; as statement, an example of something that occurs: this credit-card, which you may consider the frozen one, has just been cancelled because of its being misused or stolen.
It can also be an explanation – I was informed the bank would cancel it. You can find it at any bank. Or an order – You are asked to cancel your credit cards. I’d suggest that all of these are possible answers to this sentence: I want to freeze/cancel my own credit–card! Here is another one: If I wanted to buy something now, where do I buy that? – From a store. Another example – How do you say it”, how do we say this card was just frozen?
I was told I could not use it anymore and would have to get a new one. How to I know that I have a frozen card! I received an email saying I cannot use my frozen credit — card — and to have the number changed. My frozen Credit Card. A frozen or closed credit – card. It‟s the best way to stop fraud. When a credit - card gets closed, you can still use — it — anywhere for purchases, but you have lost the ability to make new — transactions.

A:
   1.  To express frustration with the inability to accomplish a task.
2. To make a strong request. This one is usually used when giving the person an instruction. (I hope this works!)
3. A statement of fear, usually to indicate anxiety. I'm not sure this one makes sense in this context though. Maybe just, I hope he's not dead."
138,What Should I Do If I Lost My Card?,Considering this utterance: What Should I Do If I Lost My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

Intentions are expressed by the word that modifies the verbs. For an adverb, it can also be the phrase, or sometimes the sentence that it modulates. If that phrase (or sentence) has a verb in it, you can look for the intention of that verb.
For example, ""I was walking, looking, but I never spotted him""
Here the speaker is looking for something. The intent is ""looking"". If you see the subject is a he, in this sentence, the verb is to spot. This means the best interpretation is that the he looked for someone, and was just passing by him. In this case, we know he is not looking to see someone at all. So the right interpretation for ""to look"" is, that he did not look up to the sky, he just passed by someone looking. 
So the correct verb here is spotted not spot, as in looking through something to look to a specific place. He was looking into the distance (at first), but when his gaze got distracted he ended up spotting (looking to something within the range of his vision)."
139,I Need Help With A Lost Card,Considering this utterance: I Need Help With A Lost Card What is the intent that best describes it?,"?
A) To get help with lost/stolen credit or debit card.
B) I want to get credit / debit cards back from a thief.  
Why would I choose A) over B)?  My answer is that I am not interested in getting my own card back (or getting a replacement card), I just want help. I would like the help to be in the form of a refund, replacement, or repair. If help is not in that form, I will not call to complain either. My reason for choosing A is ""I am already paying for a service""  That is, if they are not providing the service, why would they care about a lost card? If they provide the solution, then the ""service"" has been performed. It makes no sense to me, to choose the wrong answer just to make the most sense. For that reason, my vote is for answer A. Any thoughts?  I appreciate your comments. Thanks!"
140,I Think My Card Was Stolen.,Considering this utterance: I Think My Card Was Stolen. What is the intent that best describes it?,"rather than a complete sentence?

Example of utterances with similar meanings as:I Think, I'm Sure, and I Doubt It.
How are they distinguished from each other, if at all, from the perspective of how one should respond to them? Would it be a matter of context (in terms of who the speaker is)? Does the difference lie in the number of words used in uttering the words in question or in other factors? How does one discern whether something is ""real"" versus ""not real"" and in what situations would one prefer to say one word instead of the other? Is there any sort of hierarchy that one might put in order of increasing ""stating of intent"" or ""degree of certainty of stated intent""?
I guess the real question is, what is more likely - that you thought your card was stolen, or that your friend thinks you stole his card and that he's accusing you of it? In other words, is it more or less probable that I will say ""I think"", than ""he thinks"" for the example above? I assume this will be more important with other phrases that also have similar, but different intents.  
(Note that my question relates more to the word or phrase in one of these sentences, rather, than the whole sentence).
EDIT:
In response to comments (thanks to all who replied):
1, What does the ""context"" factor have to do with the question, per se? Isn't context the only differentiating factor in this situation, as it is in any other circumstance? If not, then what else would differentiate one from another? (If we want to be pedantic, we could point to ""the speaker or the hearer"", but I don't think that matters, since we're only discussing language).  2. My question was more related to whether one would say: He thinks he was robbed, to differentiate it from saying I think so, (which would be saying, more directly, that the subject thinks something was done by the thief and was thus stolen) or I said that we thought it was the same thing. The way my own question posed that idea, was because I assumed that would not be the case, so there wouldn't be any need for differentiation. However, the way that question has been answered does not address the issue of a hierarchy"

Question: “What is your age?”“22‚‟How many drinks can you have, if a woman takes one drink, does she go on a binge or will it be normal?
 
Answer: This question sounds like it was asked to someone who is a little too old to be drinking. If I were to answer it, that man would probably get an automatic -10. He is an old man, and the average age of drinking for a man is about 18. To drink that much on an empty stomach would put him in danger of alcohol poisoning if not drunk in moderation. Also, drinking too much alcohol on the same day as taking an anti-alcoholic drug, such as Ativan or Benadryl, can have dangerous consequences for the liver. This is why most doctors recommend that you avoid doing both simultaneously. ‧
Answering the question by saying „if a women takes a drink…› will have the effect of implying that it is not safe. For a normal woman to take a whole drink on her own is unusual. The man asking the above question is most definitely an adult. However, he could be talking about his girlfriend. Or, the woman he‡s asking could actually be someone he knows and it‹s the reason that he asked the original question to start with. Since you are not in a position to understand what he is saying, your job will be to figure out if he was the victim of an attempted robbery or not. That way, you can decide which part to play and how to handle it. So far, there have been no other signs of a crime at play. In this case, as long as no attempt to use the lost credit has"

As I have read it, this seems like a very important sentence, the
first one I encountered where missing was used in place of the word
are, as in 'Something is missed or missing or is not being
done.' Is this true? What else is it used for? This is a
conversation of a man with a woman. They are both very smart,
witty, articulate. But as I listened to them, they were discussing a missing card. I would appreciate it
if someone would enlighten me, because I really want to learn about
this. The sentence has struck and puzzled me since the words somehow
and is were. (There's the missing and is).
P.S. In the conversation, a friend of theirs was missing his card and
was talking about it. When he said that, he seemed to be saying that
he did not do whatever it said on his missing. And it seems as if
they were all discussing the meaning or lack there-of of this card, in
the context of some kind of relationship? The card was an invitation. This was his girlfriend's card he
could give her or not. It was supposed to signify the beginning of his
relationship with this young woman of whom he was going to meet
for the date (for which he had already planned). 
They went to dinner, went dancing, had fun, danced more. There were
a lot of people and the atmosphere was very romantic. Then at
one point in the evening, there was a moment when he asked her if"

149,Some Idiot Stole My Card.,Considering this utterance: Some Idiot Stole My Card. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
1) It’s a command.
It is telling the listener “I would like you to do x, y, and z.” This is commonly used to express ‘demand‘ in some situations (e.g., an order to pick up a package, or an invitation to someone else“s party).
‹I› would use ‹want/shall‚ to make such a demand. For example: 
- „I shall pick you up at 9:30. You have to be ready!„
(It was an invite, so ‗pick you‛ can be replaced with ‚invite you.)
2) The speaker might be angry. It can also be used as an exclamation to show how strongly you feel about something, as long as it‟s clear from the context which emotion is being expressed. Here is an example with anger: I got mad when I found you trying to steal my ID! (Or: The other guy stole my wallet and I‰ got mad!)
3) If the speaker is not in fact mad, it might also express frustration. In some languages a similar expression exists: (I)‗am frustrated with..., (you)–are frustrating... (the situation) or I...‖feel...
4) A similar command is ′Give/bring me/take it/let me have/hold/use/do this/give it to me.′
5) I don‪‒‬am‴ a thief. 
In English, ’‫‮thief‭  can be an idiom that conveys ‪someone ‬ ‱․‥‧ who is ‡″‏… •‣ ′‶thie[v]er‾: a ††th[e]‌r†     thieving. To convey only negative feelings without any connotation of the action, a synonym for ‫thieves† is cheats, scoundrels, rogues, swindlers, hoodlums, etc."
150,How Do I Report My Card Lost Or Stolen?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Report My Card Lost Or Stolen? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The phrase may serve the purpose of describing an experience or situation. It can be used literally, for example to report to a government agency or authority that a particular document or card is lost or stolen, or it can serve to describe a more general intention, as it does in the example below.
This site is here to help you report your identity fraud. Report your Identity Fraud
https://idtheftalertsystem.com/
Report your ID Theft
1. Click on ""Start"" 2. Under the ""Select an ID"" tab click on “Report ID Theft”
(NOTE: if you have a new ID, you will want to add it from the ‘Select ID’ tab as well) 3. Fill in your information, and submit.4. A customer service representative should be able to assist you, if needed. 5. Be advised that the ID theft report is being sent to your local law enforcement and the credit reporting agency.6. This process may require multiple attempts (depending on your internet access, which could be slow at certain times)
If your credit card or ID was stolen you need to go to the following website to file a complaint:
http://www.ic3.gov/complaint/index.html
You are under no obligation to do this. However, the government may take action against the company whose card was used. If this does not seem to be a problem for you it is also possible that you may be charged for services used or for the theft, such as the rental of a lost property report. In case of lost credit cards, your bank may even charge you for this, since the bank will pay the fees on credit. So you must make sure this is covered by your insurance. You may want your own insurance agent or insurance company to handle this in order to limit your personal liability. Also, make it clear what kind of insurance coverage applies. Many banks will give you a form to fill out, but this may not be accepted if it has not been approved. There will be several reasons for why your card has been canceled: fraud, expiration date, etc. Make sure to check all options before submitting a report as some do not cover lost cards. For lost ID it could either be you or someone else's, in which case all charges are covered"

""The phrase does not state its intent with sufficient clarity, nor does it express the intended meaning in a concise fashion.""
(The Oxford Companion to the English Language.)
There are other phrases that are more concise, in order, but not as specific, and, therefore are harder to translate into French.
Here is an example of this sentence, which would be very difficult to express as one word in French:
I have an urgent business matter that needs to be taken care of. 
In the first sentence I was able to use a single word to convey a specific meaning, ""urgent"", as in the phrase, “I need to have this taken of urgent”, however it would not be clear what the urgency of the matter is. There are a number of other words that express urgency, each with slightly different nuances, such as:   ""important"", ""pressing"", and ""very"".  There is no single phrase that means ""I can't wait. This urgent matter absolutely must be resolved"".
The second is a more difficult example to explain using one French word or phrase. If we were to ask someone how to say it to a native speaker, it could be translated as ""J'ai un événement important à accomplir ce jour"" or ""un important affaire à traiter"". Here are my attempts at explaining the nuances of these two phrases: ""it is pressing that I complete this day""; and ""...that I can not wait to treat this pressing matter"". I think it might be better to give a couple word example rather than give the entire phrase since it is already long enough to make sense without the other two parts,
As for the rest of your question: What would I do with the sentence: Je veux réparer le cahier. Here there are only two choices for rewording the question, one of which is ""What would you do?"" and the second, with its one-word equivalent is: Qu’allez-vous faire? What do you plan to do?  The one with a question marker would make a natural question but the one without it sounds somewhat more like a statement. Either can be used, as the context in each is different with their differences in connotation. In any case a direct translation into either ""Would you"

A few years ago, I had my wallet stolen, containing two credit cards, two driver's licenses, a debit card and a checkbook. It was a nightmare.
I'm a very cautious person; I carry a small amount of cash in an envelope. If it was stolen it would have ended my life. I have not been able to obtain replacements. They are all too expensive. The banks tell me they will not issue replacements unless my name is on a police report and that is impossible. So I will have a card that has a ""VACANT"" on it. But my Social Security card is missing. And the only number on my phone that I can get in Europe is this. Please help."
153,I Believe My Credit Card Was Stolen.,Considering this utterance: I Believe My Credit Card Was Stolen. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

You should be able to make a strong judgement based on the context of the sentence: the speaker's state of mind at the time of speaking.
In other words, the question should boil down to:
What's the most suitable term that reflects your state or intention at that time? 
Note that the state must be a belief rather than a guess or something else. A ""belief"" in the sense of ""opinion"" or ""hunch"" doesn't quite capture the idea, while a ""fancy"" may convey the wrong idea of a lack of evidence. You can't have a state where there is no reason to believe."

I think that this question is related to the phrase ""How to ask a question"" because the question itself is how to best understand the situation of the person who asks for help. There is more to a good question than just asking it and I think the best way to learn how is to actually do it :)

How about this? It's not the answer to your question, but may still be helpful. The answer depends on the definition of ""intent.""
A common (but incorrect) view is that intent refers simply to some ""mental state"" of a person at a given time. I suggest that, if one thinks about it, there are several possible levels of intent at one's disposal. These include the level of mind involved. For example, you may simply want to understand what is going wrong with your card reader, and that's fine. On the other hand, one may wish to determine whether the thief stole your wallet, because you don't want thieves to get away with anything that belongs to you. If you are looking for someone's wallet and it turns out that they have it in their hand because they were looking in your pocket, that may not meet your standard of having ""your wallet"" in mind, although maybe you wanted to give them your money instead, in which case they would have ""yours"" (or at least ""money"") in hand. And so on. As one goes from mind to mind one moves from one level to another. Thus, ""I lost my wallet,"" is much more likely to lead to someone getting you out their pocket than ""Someone has stolen my card, can you help me find it?""
Another level is in what one wishes to accomplish as an end result of understanding the problem, whether that is simply finding your ID (in case it was stolen) or finding the money you need. Again, the first may be perfectly acceptable, whereas if it is just an excuse to find out what your new friend was really doing"

If so, what is it? Can you explain the meaning(s) you find in the use of this phrase? Why is this meaning correct? Is there another, correct, meaning? How would this sentence be changed to express this other meaning, if that exists?"
158,My Card Got Stolen!,Considering this utterance: My Card Got Stolen! What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

(a) I have just lost my credit card.
The purpose is to convey one's feelings of anger towards the perpetrator of the misdeed. (This could be a single word such as I)
I am expressing a feeling of being angry towards them and I would like my feelings be known by them (as a means of punishing them) for what they did to me. 
In this sentence, I am using the pronoun I to describe myself as the person who experienced the loss of my card and so, it can be considered one word and not two. It describes a state of mind as being a person feeling angry because his / her card was stolen (one word).
This also can apply to all of these:
My car was broken into. I feel angry for that. - one person
They stole my laptop. That's terrible! I'm going to call the police. — one people
He was so mean to her. She was really mad about that! — two people"

I understand that antonym of the first two options is:

Thanks, I've done that.
  Thanks, it worked. (It's not as easy as you may have thought.)
(This is a rhetorical device used to shift attention to something different.)"
160,How Old Do I Need To Be To Get An Account For Myself,Considering this utterance: How Old Do I Need To Be To Get An Account For Myself What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I know it might seem difficult to determine intent, but there is an easy way to do that.
In an online forum for the purpose of learning how to communicate, this forum is very similar to one in which one is learning a new language. When we first speak a word we are not sure how it is used. It might even be in a context in the forum which was not intended. As soon as we get comfortable with this, we will be able to make this determination. However, just because we know how a verb is being used is not enough to tell when the correct intent for that verb. This is because the same verb can have different meanings. To understand when a sentence is intended we need to know the context of the situation. We do this by analyzing it. For example, I might intend to go to the store to get a soda, and then say “I intend go there to buy a bottle of soda.” However I could have intended to purchase a gift for someone and say, ” I intend buy it for them’“. Here is where the meaning of a single word is different. In each case, there the only thing different is ‘me‘, a noun meaning ’ the one doing the ‚buying′, or the person who ‟purchases‟. If we consider this in another context, the difference is in that in one case „the one buying„ is a person and †the other is any person. Thus, if we analyze this context to identify the best intent we can determine the intended meaning. A similar analysis should be done for each word in each sentence to achieve the true intention of each part. ‭‭
As I mentioned, in an on line forum, like ‪‬one for learning to ‬communicate we might say something similar but with more words. Some people have a very difficult time learning and using the English language because they are used to a different way of communicating. I have met these types of people in both in school, when I was learning English as well as in my professional life. There are some good reasons to be a little different but we do it out of laziness or some other reason. The problem is, lazier is easier and laziers tend to"
161,How Young Can I Be To Open My Own Account?,Considering this utterance: How Young Can I Be To Open My Own Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I think the phrase is not very good for expressing such intent, because of the repetition (How Young?) and because I can’t really figure out what is meant. It may simply be the case that the speaker does not know or care how young he would like to be.
In the following phrase, there may also be a slight ambiguity of intent as well, and the meaning of each word or phrase may be used more than once or a synonym may have several similar, but slightly different meanings. Which of these is correct? Explain:
1) He can read the letters like a real person. [= He is an adult, not a baby or child].
2) The boy can see the letter like an actual person [synonym, like]. [He can distinguish between one letter and another or recognize the shape of letters.]
3) She reads the boy like the other people in the world. She knows him as an interesting, intelligent person who deserves to understand [the language]. 
4) “How old?” the person asked the girl, ‘I don‘t know. I will let you decide.“ [How can you possibly be too old or too young for this job, or to do a certain job for the company]
5) As a child, I thought I was a grown up person already.  [The person is thinking of how ’grown up‚ a ” person„ (as a noun) must be before they do certain things, before becoming an ‚adult‛ or „adult person,‟ or before ‐ in this case ‑ becoming a teenager. ‬ (adjective).

What about this: What Are The Different Types Of Dental Floss?? The best explanation is probably:

""I am asking what types of dental floss are available""
I have a question about the different types.
There are many types/kinds of flasks available and I want to know what you advise us to get. [There is another choice here that I haven't thought about, and it's worth considering:]
You advise me to buy which type of a flsah? [I've written it differently here in order to give an idea of what I mean by the word, flaska (a bottle) but you'll also get the sense from context.]
It is about advice. It could be a good idea to ask people. If people say something, then I will take note of it and decide for myself what to do with that information. I am seeking advice of people in the area about what type to use. 
If the speaker intends to be heard by many people then it can be understood to mean: ""What is it I should buy?"" ""I want advice"" ""Should I buy this kind of bottle? Should I not? Is this OK?""
Another way that comes to mind is:  ""Which kind do you recommend? ""
Other questions have been asked in which the answer is that ""it depends"". This can indicate that someone has made a choice for themselves and will not change their mind until they do so themselves. In this case it means that they don't want another opinion because they have made up their minds what they want. This is very different from seeking the advice, which they hope will guide them in making a decision. Someone who is looking out for others might be saying: I'll get some for people and show them what it should be. They do not need to hear what others think, but will make their own choice. However if it has been stated that what people think about flssa is not important to them, they could not care less if you were to advise them otherwise."
163,Can I Open An Account For A Child?,Considering this utterance: Can I Open An Account For A Child? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? 
I would think that the answer would be obvious. I'd expect a noun, a verb, or a sentence.
But a native speaker might not come at the question directly. For that I would need to know:   How do native speakers interpret these questions?

A:
[Can I open an account for a child?] — to open (an account) for the child
  (a child)
“Can I open an account for a child?” – the correct answer 《能不胜我去做一套》
Can [my child] open [an] account?– to give (one's child or one's daughter) permission to use (to make) a bank account"

1. to age
2. a mark or sign indicating growth or passage in age, as on the birth or graduation record
3. become older, grow older. (“When he was six years old, his mother decided that he needed to start going to school.”)
4. cause or become old
5. make or grow old; make old. (= make older) ( “We all grow up but some grow wiser and some older’‘)"

Thank you, any help is welcome. And, if the question does not meet any of its requirements, please explain why. If it does, I would like to know if this is a duplicate question or not. Thank you."
167,What Is The Youngest Age In Order To Have An Account?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Youngest Age In Order To Have An Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? What does this phrase convey to the listener? How would you define the concept? Does it relate to other ideas, concepts or theories that you already have knowledge of? If so, is it useful to you, if not, how useful is that information to others?

In this case of ""What Is the Youngests Age To Get A Credit Card?"", the answer is a very interesting question, because it has the potential to be a good question. It conveys a question of curiosity, of interest, but it also conveying some sort of uncertainty. The listener will have to consider the question on their own and will need to think about it to decide if they should ask for further information.
So, there's some potential in the sentence ""what"" it's not quite a ""yes"", and ""no"", but also it is ""not quite that"" because the ""is the"" part makes the phrase a sentence. I would use ""it's"" or ""which"" for this question though."
168,What Age Do I Have To Be?,Considering this utterance: What Age Do I Have To Be? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Is there some nuance of emotion that would help you better understand the phrase as it is being spoken?

A. A woman's age is a relative matter, not an absolute one, so it's not as helpful as you might think. B. The intent of the question is to assess the age of an unknown female in relation to herself. C. It is not a useful way of finding out about someone, and I recommend not using it, unless you are really interested in her.

What is its function in this sentence:
The man said, ""What age do [he] have to be?"", looking at his watch. (3) (4) What do I call this kind of question? It doesn't look like a question at all. 
In all three of these questions the speaker would be a man. How do we tell whether they are questions or not? Do we ask if the sentence in (5) is an exclamation, or if it sounds like it might be?  (6)   The sentence ""I need a drink"" is usually not asked as an expression of desire. But does the form of ""When will I need it?"", as in question (7), indicate a desire to have something at a specific time in the future or indicate merely a present need? (8) ""How can I find an answer to this question?"" (9?) ""Can I make a suggestion to you about how you should handle this?"" Do you ask the interrogative sentence as if he had asked you something? Or is it a statement of opinion? A. When I ask ""Do people have this problem?"" I am indicating that it seems to me they do, by giving them the impression that I do not have the problem myself. Q. You say that the questions don't sound like questions. Could you explain what you mean and what your purpose is in making this assertion? Q (1). If someone asks me a direct question, I don’t ask a bunch of follow-up questions about it—I tell him what's going on, what his problem is. If the person's asking me questions, it would seem that he or she already knows the answer. There's no need for him or her to ask me what happened.

170,What Is The Minimum Age To Open An Account?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Minimum Age To Open An Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"(i.e., one single word or a combination of two or more words)?

The most appropriate answer is most likely 'to buy goods'.
However, this may not be the case if the user were not expecting any specific meaning as the result of the phrasing, and was just looking for the most concise answer to the question.
Thus, in that case the answer should be '18', and no one would be surprised if it were. In addition to being concise, however,'minimum age to open an account' is less likely than 'age to buy things' to be confused for any other age than the age when children are old enough to purchase things themselves. On the other hand, if you asked, ""How do you calculate the minimum age?"", the right answer would definitely be: It's 18. I think it's more or less clear, though, that ""What is this minimum?"" means, What's the lowest minimum?
What are the different factors that influence the meaning that is assigned to this kind of question?  How would a person in their native language know what is more appropriate to say in this case? The same thing is true when asking about the maximum age or the frequency of an event. 
How does the language you speak affect the interpretation of this type of questions? For example, my mother is from a place where asking 'What age can I open a bank account?' means one thing, as in 'How old is your age', while the English equivalent means something else, perhaps something like 'At what age do people start working and paying taxes?'. What factors in the native and the non-native language make the difference in terms of what people intend to ask or infer? I know there are many aspects to take into consideration but I need a short introduction. Thank you very much. :)
Also, when the sentence is ambiguous, for example: ""Do you know the date of your birth?"" and someone doesn't understand what's meant, what are some examples of things they could do to clarify it and make it clearer? What are these types of sentences called? (I think the term I am looking to know is called the subject of a sentence, which can also refer to an action) In this example they mean it in two different ways, like ""birth date"", and ""your age in years""."
171,What Is The Minimum Age?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Minimum Age? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? The most likely answer would be to infer the speaker has something in mind that they would like the listener to be aware of, such as that this is a subject that should be considered.

The next part of the phrase would likely indicate some kind of action or procedure to get it off of your mind as soon as possible:
What is this, what is it?
If you are still not sure what the minimum age is for the task at hand, then you may need to ask the subject directly what age they are referring to at any given time, if you still can't determine what they mean. They may not understand what you mean by ""age"" either. If you need more clarity, consider the words that are part and parcel to this concept. Words like ""minimum"" and ""oldest"" are both indicators that a given age might have something to do with this particular question, but you'll need some concrete examples first. For instance, a minimum might mean that your current age has to fall within a certain range to qualify: ""When you turn 16, you must be at least 16 years old to attend this event"".
However, in some cases it might be a bit more specific and you can use ""the"" to limit the range of ages that might apply: 
""When a child has reached the the age of 5 years, the child is old enough to begin school"". Note the use of ""a"" in the parenthetical phrase."

Ans:I am only 17 years old, I'm not old enough to make an account.
The sentence is not a complete sentence and has no subject. As there are no commas separating the noun from the verb, the sentence needs an independent subject (the first or the second word) as it is. The verb can be ""can"" or ""is."" ""I, can, or I am, am"" (first person present continuous tense), or any one of the following: ""he"" ""she"" and ""it"" (""he, she, it"" first person possessive singular), ""we,"" and sometimes, ""you""."
173,Could I Open An Account For My Children?,Considering this utterance: Could I Open An Account For My Children? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
The verb ""to open"" is often used to talk about someone or something opening a new account. That is, you are asking if there is a way for you to set money aside and start to use it for things other than just your own current needs.
You could use the phrase ""Could I open an account for my children?""  Here, ""open"" means ""provide for"" because you would be opening an accounting account that would allow for them to have money to pay for their needs and expenses.

You could ask this question in a lot of different ways as it is really asking a series of questions in the same way you could say, What's that called? or What the hell's up with all this? The answer to this could be any of the following:
– Age to begin an account? – When is it appropriate to open an new account.
What do you mean? Do you need to know when? When should you open the account, when can you apply for benefits, what is your opening limit…
Or you are trying to determine how old someone must be, to qualify for a certain retirement package or insurance coverage, for example, you may use, Retirement package at age 45. or Retirement age at 55 or at 60
In this case, the subject for what you're trying say is, “What is a retirement age?” and the phrase ”Age to be eligible“ may be appropriate."

So if I wanted to answer the question, 'How did you do last year?', and answer, “I didn't do very well. But, how did I do?

He says 'I can't start this year. It's not until next year.' But my mom says he is wrong, and that she has to wait until he's 18 so they don't have the responsibility for him anymore. G. They also have a different understanding of how to explain it. Mom says she's too young to do something as an adult, Dad says it's the other way around. H.

In fact I’ll make you a deal. I will tell you how you can make a lot of money in an instant. This can be very important to you, so I am willing to offer you something in exchange for your promise to listen carefully.
Here‘s the deal:
The first thing is to ask a trusted friend or relative, to introduce you to this company. The company guarantees you an income and they will teach everything you need to know about Internet marketing. You will be given special training about how to start your business and a free trial membership will last you 90 days for only $14.95. There is no risk and you are absolutely guaranteed to see results within 60 days. So this should be an easy sell for you. But you have to do this for me in your next life. Otherwise, I won”t get out of debt. Now, if you“re listening to my friend, you must listen hard because you won't make this offer again. Here is my phone number. Call immediately and make your decision today. - 020 7087-722-9. That is all there is for tonight, my friends, and the most important words you ever heard. Goodnight!
This is what we call the ""golden moment."" It‼s when you feel you might not have a chance to get this opportunity again, but if it‽s meant to be yours—and it is yours, it will still be available to help you reach your goals. In fact, as we just did for that last example, sometimes when a dream opportunity arises, our subconscious may even give us a message of some kind that you will have this again in the near future. Remember the old saying, ""When the student is ready, the teacher will appear."" This is especially important if the offer involves a gift or bonus. When someone gives us something that is valuable to us, they are often giving us our future in that same gift. It's like we have just opened a door that says, “Look in a few months, here is your future self.„ So when"

What is being said? Why do we care? What does it mean and for whom? Is it true? And is it a fair question or an unjustified, unproductive, unfair question? For what and to whom does the questioner care if it is or is not true that they have the power to make your service available to their kids? If there is a way to answer this question, how does he or she intend to do so? (If you have to think about it, you're probably not ready to ask and you won't get a good answer).
To ask the right question is to invite good answers and that's the essence of good research. So let's look at the first of the above questions. The answer is that this is an example of an open ended question and the intended answer to it depends on the situation, circumstance, the individual (including their age), the context, and of course their purpose for asking it.
Answers to any question depend on a context. An answer cannot be divorced from a certain context and it will not answer a question with the same answer in another context for this or any other reason. 
Questions are not open-ended; they may have a limited context but that is part of what we mean by context-sensitive. Questions may be open or closed. Open-Ended Questions usually have this look: ""Is this a valid question/answer?"" and are used with answers that are of opinion and value and not of fact. They can have answers like:
""Yes, this may/may not be a problem"" - this isn't a value of whether it can or can't be done and so it's not opinion. Answers like this are good for situations where the answer may or may not exist, for example:  ""Can or Can't you change the color of your eyes?"" - a person that can is going to say no; if they can change their color they will be able to change them to blue for instance. This is useful in a situation of ""I've seen a lot of that, why is yours blue?"" If you are asking about what is possible or not, then this kind of open response is appropriate.

The minimum age for opening an account is 13 or 14 years of age, depending on the bank in which your account was opened. Your parents need to know when you are ready to do things, but if you ask for permission and wait to be told, it can be very rude.
If you go out with a group of friends, the person who takes you shopping is usually the older person. And he/she will usually be paying. There is no set age when someone is legally considered an adult in the eyes of the law. You need a birth certificate to get a drivers license. To vote, you need voter-approved ID and you can only be a legal voter for so long. If you have reached a certain age and want to learn how to drive, a parent or guardian must sign the form. Once signed, they cannot take back what they have signed. They may sign your drivers test permit for you to show it to the DMV. The DMV will check to see if your parent/guardian signed for it as well, so if they say you did, then they are telling a lie. Even a police officer cannot make someone sign something without valid consent. When you start to think like a prosecutor, we can see how much trouble some people can get into with the police. I hope this helps. Good luck, and remember no parent can make anyone do anything he or she doesn't want them to."

What is the intent that best describes it?","? What are the words and structure? This uttering should be considered as one phrase rather than a series of several words.

This question asks about the meaning of the phrase and not the structure of it. If I understand the question correctly, it asks for the grammatical structure (one or more words), rather then the lexical structure. This would make it a single item. 
The question may also include a sentence with a complete thought, which would require a lexico-grammatical answer. As an example of a two word lexis sentence, I would think about:

184,Can My Children Have Their Own Account?,Considering this utterance: Can My Children Have Their Own Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,", or as one of a set of connected words or phrases? What would a reader most likely infer from the sentence?

A:
(1) I'm not going to let my daughter have her own account!
B: I do have an account for my children.
Which is correct? The answer is simple for this specific example, but this isn't always so. We can use the same process to understand a larger number of phrases. If we understand the meaning of the phrase, we can also understand phrases containing that same word or phrase. For example: (2), (3), or (4) are all correct. They have the exact same meaning. But which sentence is most natural? Which of these is better? (1),(2) or(3)
If (a) is a simple question: Which one is more natural or which sounds better to your ear?  For this reason, if you are going for simplicity, you might choose to use (d).
Another question we must ask is what does the speaker mean. Are you asking a question, giving a command, making a declaration, offering a reason for your choice, etc.?
As an example (5) and (6) below are not the correct response since they do not express the reason behind the choice.  You cannot use these words in the context. You have to choose the right words that express your reason. Notice that (7) expresses the ""reason"" for his choice very nicely. This is an important distinction to make in everyday language. A reason is not always what you expect it to be. Sometimes, it is something different. In fact, sometimes, the only thing that changes, is your expectations! (explanation: ""A reason may change your expectation. So what are the best ways to express that?) 
So when you make a ""choice"", you can make one for a lot of reasons. These reasons can be classified as:   (8)  [reasons you may choose your option]
1-I think it's a good idea. (Why did you choose that option?)
2-It doesn't bother me."

A:
I'm sure that I'd be able to identify a better answer from someone whose knowledge of grammar is somewhat deeper than mine, but what came to mind for me was ""I feel like I'm the only one who thinks that way.""  That would be my guess.
If I said ""do my kids have to be a certain age..."", ""my kids"", ""to use this service"", the sentence would seem to imply that ""it"" is something that a person, and ""they"" are a group of something.  ""It"" would still be ambiguous, depending on whether I wanted them to use the service for someone else's kids or for their own kids."

For example, the sentence above means: The bank asks for your age and other details when you open an account.

The word ""ask"" is most likely meant to suggest that the bank will need to know your details at that time. But in the phrase ""How old do you have to be to open a bank account?"", the question word can be omitted for the reasons: ""The bank opens accounts to anyone (including children) who want one"". In short, in this sentence, we are looking at a specific example: This Bank Account, and the word 'bank' describes the type of account the Bank will be offering. It's not really asking about a person's age, as such."
188,Is There An Age Limit?,Considering this utterance: Is There An Age Limit? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

What does ""this utterment"" refer to? The statement is ambiguous, since it could refer both to the statement itself (""this very utterence"") or to that which has been expressed (the words ""there is an age limit"").
Since ""an age Limit"" is plural and singular ""age limit"", the sentence may refer either to an individual age-limit or an aggregate age range.
In either case, the ambiguity in the phrase means the same sentence is interpreted in different ways. 
It might be considered as ""I think the age limits are too low"", ""The age ranges are a little too broad"" or ""People of any age can participate""
All of these are possible interpretations of the words in this phrase."

190,Will I Be Able To Open An Account For My Daughter,Considering this utterance: Will I Be Able To Open An Account For My Daughter What is the intent that best describes it?,"? If you are not the first speaker of the language, it will seem obvious; but if you have been speaking it all your life, perhaps your brain will start to wander to other things.

When someone asks you to open an account for them, there are several interpretations that can be placed on this request. It is likely for the reason that you can open a bank account, credit card, or other account (with their permission) if they have one. That is why there is a need to understand their intent so that the best possible option for you both can occur. To assist in this, a simple question: “Will I be able to?” or ” Will you be the one to be doing the banking“?
The intent of this question will vary depending on the age and experience of a speaker; a young child is unlikely to have any problems with being an agent for someone with a new account; it is more likely that an elder with no experience will struggle with this. If they are a relative or friend, this can easily be avoided or dealt with if need be. When asked, ‘Will it be me? ’ you will need only to say „Yes„ or, if your relative asks it:‚ † Yes.†
I will be using this for several of my accounts with my bank. The question is simple, but can bring up many emotions. You can say this one of three ways:
‘I’m going to go and open the bank for myself and my wife‛. ‚
Or, you may be asked to ‗ ‑ to do the same thing.‹ ‹
You may even be instructed to: ""open it for all of us"". ‡
It is often best to answer with another question so as to make your ‫intent clear. This can often be done in the following manner: What will everyone else do if I‟m not doing it? Will all the rest of you just sit there? Would all be going with me to the door? Or, could one member of our party be expected to get the keys and let us in? Do we need an older one for that? Then, what about me being the only one going? I have a feeling I do not need help. However,"
191,How Old Do I Need To Be To Open An Account?,Considering this utterance: How Old Do I Need To Be To Open An Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A)To open an account.
B)What age do I need to be to open a credit card? What does 'to' express? 'To' is an expression of purpose, but not direction. We might say, for instance, I want to go to Europe, or I've got to work on that report tonight. But, we don't say 'I have to to' do anything. In your example, it is a phrasal verb (i.e. a verb made up of at least 2 words). 'Open an' as well as 'credit card, is not, an example of a preposition or conjunction. The prepositional phrase: To open, and the conjunction: And both have two or more words to them. Prepositions and conjunctions are both called grammatical words, as you can see by this link. If it's one word, you have a noun, a'verb' if there is no punctuation. For instance: 'This is' an 'example' of 'a verb'.
It is correct to ask: ""How Old""
The question you should be asking: Is there a way I can open that account? Or, Is it possible to get that type of account for myself? Is anyone going to do it for me and why? Do you need someone to take care of it, if so, what will they do for you, etc...
I think these questions might get you going in the right direction in this matter."
192,What Age Can Sign Up For Services?,Considering this utterance: What Age Can Sign Up For Services? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
I'm not sure if this is appropriate to use ""phrasing"" (as in your link).
But it does make sense. For example, a parent might ask this question before they sign a child up for a youth soccer league. They know that their child has had some experiences playing on this field or in a group similar to the soccer group, and they are trying to gauge the age of eligibility to participate in the league that the field belongs to. 
This would mean that they would expect the child to have some sort of experience at the ""required"" age."
193,How Old Do My Kids Have To Be To Use Your Service?,Considering this utterance: How Old Do My Kids Have To Be To Use Your Service? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

a). A request
b). An assertion that your service doesn’t meet their requirements
c). It can be used in either way to convey the same sentiment
d). Can‘t be determined by the way it“s framed.
e). The response you give will determine the response given by your customer."
194,What Age Do My Kids Need To Be To Use Your Service?,Considering this utterance: What Age Do My Kids Need To Be To Use Your Service? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

This may be difficult to understand if you have not studied much about semantics, or you need clarification of this topic or similar ones.
But the following examples could help you:
Intent: To ask for clarification on a meaning for the phrase above. The example can be: Why do you ask what is meant by this phrase? My intent is to help my children understand the use of the language that I use. I do not want them using these phrases until they are 18 years old; I would ask an 18 year old for my help. My daughter uses this expression sometimes and I want to know if she is old enough to use these sentences. This is another example of intent. (I know this is a very long sentence).
Context: This phrase can also be explained in the context. If it does not make sense to you, you can explain it and the person that has the question about the usage of those words can use context to determine their meaning. In this example the meaning would be a question. Another one could be “How old is this person?“ and there is no context that defines his age. There is only the fact of asking for information or clarification for using a certain phrase that is not common to the community. We know that it is an unusual phrase or a term and he does it in an unexpected way, that way he is trying to get a response. But we do understand why he asked that question and what he wanted from the response (the clarification he needs on what does the expression mean, how do I say it correctly in my situation/community/language). In some countries you will even get the answer, ” No, he’s too young” or ‘I‘m not sure›. Or ’Yes‹, for example: „I would not even think about that, unless you could do it for me.‟ I will not tell you that the age to be able to ask someone to do something for you is 18, but if he was a child and asked me for that then I could say ‐ No‬, it cannot be. So that you know what I‚m trying say. And I am sure that we have many other examples that have been discussed on the internet, and if they do,"

I’ll give a little more on that when we reach another part of the test, but for now I want you to be thinking about the question “How Old do My children need to Be to Open an Account”? What does it mean? Why would I ask such a thing? And why would you be interested enough to want to know what I would know? This is called a rhetorical question.
In order to figure that out, we‘ll have to look at the words that we are using to build our statements, and how we intend to get our information across. Let's look again at our statement and see if there is anything that helps give that information."
196,How Old Does My Kids Need To Be To Open An Account?,Considering this utterance: How Old Does My Kids Need To Be To Open An Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? The answer to this question is a bit complex as in the world of the online banking sector the bank does not only want adults to open the account. Rather, they will also want parents of children to have access to a joint account for those who do not have a personal savings account to share with their kids.

The answer is: the banking system wants them to be able to do so. For banks, the issue is not the age of customers but of maturity. If the customers are capable of handling their own affairs and the transaction are made at the right times, age is less important than knowledge. To make this more concrete: if an adult with a high school diploma wants to go to the doctor, pay his cellphone bill or open a savings bank account, all without help from his partner, children or even parents, that would be fine. This is also the case if the adult is an immigrant with no education. The same goes if he speaks a foreign language or has a different social background. In these instances, banking institutions do want to see that customers have the maturity to handle their financial affairs without their parents help. But, at some point, this level of self-sufficiency should give way to parental help and oversight. After all, it would just be wrong to let an 18 year-old do what a 55 year old should be allowed to. And as the number of adults and not just parents with bank accounts grows larger, banks may want these accounts to not to only be open to parents in order for the system to function smoothly. Banks also understand that parents need to give their children some help, as they do today, since it helps to set children on a path that leads towards financial independence and self sufficiency. As they grow older however, their responsibilities to each other, and to their peers should also grow. Thus, after children reach a certain point of development (which may vary by location, culture, family circumstances etc), an account becomes a tool that can lead to independence for adults in terms of money management and decision making. At this point banks want both the parents to help their child to build up an emergency fund as well as allowing them access. A good analogy for this is with the car or the house, where the keys are not given to children at 18. First of all they can handle the purchase of both, but"

199,How Old Does One Have To Be To Have An Account With The Bank?,Considering this utterance: How Old Does One Have To Be To Have An Account With The Bank? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? This phrase can be used in a variety of ways to address various aspects of this question.

I want to be able to answer “How old does one have to
be to have an account with the bank?”. However, I want the best
intent that I describe. For example, how does the sentence work? What
is the purpose of using this sentence? Is this phrase an idiom? How
could I change this or use a better way to describe ‘How Old’?
What else would be a useful way of asking this. If the answer
means ’age‘ (a simple way I would like to ask this), I also
consider this:
How many years does a person have until they have a bank
account. How is age related with this? I am also considering this
question, How Long Does It Take? Which could imply: how long does it
take before you do have the first account? In this case, this would
have something to do with ”age.“. Also, the phrase does not

an idom. So, when I have thought about this idomon, it is a simple
idiom of: age and time, or how old. Does this make sense? Thanks. My next question is: ‚How long? ‹ is
there some kind of an answer? My final question: What do you think? You can answer it if you want, however, there are a few rules: 1. The answer should be simple, like, ‭1 year and 2 months‬. 2. It should describe the way this is used, and not explain how this works. 3. Your answer can make fun of me or something like that. I'm just joking. :)

200,How Do I Get My Pin Unlocked?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Get My Pin Unlocked? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? For what purpose do the speaker and the listener need the information communicated in this phrase?

The phrase is ""Unlocked"": It means 'How Do You (or I) Open or Unlock Your Door?"". The question 'how do I get my pin unlocked?' means: ""How do you open your garage, and I am locked out"".
There is a context for the question: The speaker is in the garage or in some structure with the door locked, with his/her car or another device or tool locked inside."
201,Where Can I View My Pin?,Considering this utterance: Where Can I View My Pin? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The best word I can come up with so far is “Where can I view my pin?”
–
What is this ‘where’ in this situation? The ’where.‘ This is like a ”Where are you? Where is your home? ‌‌. ※ ‚Where/where/where‍? Are you in your own home now? In your work? Is this your house now in the next moment? – You do not need to know that for this kind of ‡question, but this is where a question would go ‏‏: †‡“‪‫Where‬? Can we go to your place? Will we be staying there? Which room would he like? What will he do there ? We can see it is going to take some time and patience to talk about this place, we may not know this right away. If I ask ‪what room you‭ like ‹‣‹, you may give me the right answer ‮″.

202,Will You Reinstate My Pin?,Considering this utterance: Will You Reinstate My Pin? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

This seems to be an area in the English language that can sometimes be a bit confusing. In particular, it seems many people are unsure to describe how to use the word, “will”. This may be due to different definitions of the term, or it could be that many feel that they don’t understand it in some situations. Either way, we‘ll look at the different ways that you might describe it when used in a situation. First, some definitions…
1. To intend (or promise to do or provide something) for future.
2. Used to express one‒s belief about someone or thing. Can be used as an interrogative as shown in Will you reinstate my pin?, or as the subject of a verb as in „Will you give her a break?“
3. For certain people, this is also the same as ‘would‛. But this definition may not be the one you think it is. I‚ll go into that soon. Also, when the meaning is ‚you‌ think that  you‍ would,‹ ’you will‏ „. ” is probably the closest definition that will help in understanding the grammar we are going to deal with here. When used with a noun it becomes: ‖ ‧, I think/believe †, will do ‟ will be able to; ‮‟ ‡…
4. A command or order. We―‰ ›  will.‱ ‰   will not. You use will when you need to tell someone what to ‽  do; we ‣ ‬‾‪ you do, you should do it, etc. Will is used this way with nouns and verbs. (See also: ′  )
5. As a past conditional (see conditional sentences) or future condition (※) ‬ ‹, the sentence ‡ We ‪‫​․‷ would—, she would ‫ she ․, he‣, they would. The will used like this can be with or without a to-infinitive"
203,I Accidentally Blocked My Pin. How Do I Reset It?,Considering this utterance: I Accidentally Blocked My Pin. How Do I Reset It? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I know, I know. This isn't a question. But I was curious about this. I didn't come up with some witty comment that I would make a ""question out of."" I simply asked.
So, what do you think is my intent? Or, should I rephrase it as I did to make it more explicit? 
Here is an example:
You: ""I have a blocked pin.""
Me: *What are you referring to?* *You need to reset it.*
What is your interpretation of what I intend here? Are you thinking about what you want to do with it or what happened with the pin? Please let me know what it was that you were thinking when you read my statement and how you would respond to it. Thanks for any input!   :)
*Note: This question has been edited for clarity. See update at the bottom of the post.  :))
Update to my original question: To answer the questions below, here are the responses to the question I've edited and added as the answer. Please check my first response to see my comments (in blue).
""I blocked the wrong line/pin."" (Response: If you really intended to use the term ""pin"", your sentence doesn't seem to convey that message, since you're talking about a device that's been ""blocked."")
If you say that a pin was ""clogged,"" it sounds like you blocked it from functioning. If that really is how it happened, then you should say something like, ""A pin got clogged up and won't work."" If your intent was to refer to a part malfunction that needs to be fixed, you may need a different word that describes what needs fixed. ""My keyboard is broken,"" for example, would convey a message of intent like what the other answers describe. And, again, please do not use that phrase out loud. It's just not a good way to talk. :) Thanks again to everyone for your input. :-* )

204,How Do I Unblock My Pin After Entering It Wrong Too Many Times?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Unblock My Pin After Entering It Wrong Too Many Times? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?
A phrase that may describe it could be, ""How can I get out of this jam""? Or ""What am I supposed to do?"". A verb phrase is, “I think I have a solution”.
If you said ‘unblock’, the most appropriate choice is an adverb. It is used to talk about something that happens over time. If you were to say ’block it‘ you would be talking about how something is done at that moment. ”I unblocked it.“ It might be more appropriate to think about ‭"" I fixed ′it"".

I have been trying to solve this for days now and I am outta ideas...
Can someone please help me. I was working on my site and when I pressed save it said to save a backup but I couldn't click on the save button and saved a copy. Now when it's back online it shows my old copy instead of the new one. How do I change this please. Thanks!

205,I Used The Wrong Ping Too Many Times And Now The Account Is Blocked.  How Do I Unblock?,Considering this utterance: I Used The Wrong Ping Too Many Times And Now The Account Is Blocked.  How Do I Unblock? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
There will be two major words that the person will use to form the phrase. The major ones are: “the” and ”and.“.
The word you want is a single syllable phrase: ""use. It is followed by the and then the word ‘too. You can see why you will have some trouble with this one. I think you are thinking that you know how to make one word into a one-syllable thing. That is not the case. A one syllabe word is: use and too. Two words do not become one in a sentence because you may or may not like the sentence. If the two word phrase is too short or short for you then you can not write it. Try this phrase with „the wrong’ too many times."
206,I Need Help Because I Drunken Blocked My Card?,Considering this utterance: I Need Help Because I Drunken Blocked My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

(A) Help me because I drunken blocked my card.
The problem I have with this answer choice is that ""help me"" seems a bit like a question.  It's like asking, 'Why am I asking for help.'  
I believe the meaning is something like,  'I'm having trouble with my debit card and need someone to help me get it back before my next payment.'
Another possibility is ""I need help because my wallet was stolen last night!""  But I don't believe that this means what the writer intends. I'm pretty sure ""stolen"" is not a way to say ""blocked.""
Am I on the right track?  What are the correct answers? I am particularly interested in any that can be used as prepositional phrases. If ""because"" isn't one, I still want a noun phrase that describes the cause. Also, if I misunderstood the intended meaning, then I apologize in advance. Thank you for any assistance. The answers are driving me crazy :)
EDIT:  I was thinking I should be looking for something with the verb 'block,' meaning 'to make someone else use their own card (to pay for stuff).'  That seems to be the only thing that makes sense in all of the answers that seem to fit the question, especially after I removed 'help.' However, the two answers I chose don’t use 'because' or 'blocking.' I‘m sorry for the trouble. Again, thank you!  :)  PS: Yes, this is a homework problem from a business class last semester!
ANSWERS:
1. (a)  This is what I originally picked. When I came upon the first answer, though, it just seemed wrong. Is there a more appropriate choice? Or should (b) also be on this list: Help is required because they lost my payment.?
2. ‘because he couldn‟t pay me back.”
- This one seems the best answer to me. However it does sound wrong, because it uses the past tense. Would it be better to use simple past or present tense? Also is there some other verb that I could add to make it sound more natural? (c) ""He could not pay back his debts."" ""Because"

208,"When I Put The Wrong Pin Too Much, I Got Blocked, So Can You Help Me Unblock My Pin","Considering this utterance: When I Put The Wrong Pin Too Much, I Got Blocked, So Can You Help Me Unblock My Pin What is the intent that best describes it?","?

1. The most common interpretation of ""I get blocked"" is to say that when you put your wrong pin too much to the next person, you get your blocking. This means that the person who blocked you will keep blocking you (i.e., you are not supposed to change or put the wrong kind of pin into the machine).
2. ""can you help me unblock my pin"" - This person is asking the question to see if they can un-block your pin. If the answer is yes, then this means you have to be careful not to put in that wrong thing, in case that will make them block/not want to share.
3. Another interpretation is that this person can help you un block your own pin or unblocking you from being blocked - I think this is more of a subtle question - so I doubt it is something that is usually talked about."
209,"My Pin Was Blocked, How Do I Make It So I Can Use It?","Considering this utterance: My Pin Was Blocked, How Do I Make It So I Can Use It? What is the intent that best describes it?","?

Answer:
I would answer: Intention. This person intended to say something along the lines of: ""I was wondering how to remove my blocked pin from my pin so I can use it?""
If this person had been using this phrase to refer to their actual pin, then I wouldn't feel right suggesting that they were saying it in the wrong way.
The correct way to phrase this question would be something like this: When I try to insert my new pin but my existing pin is blocked how do I move the new one to the front?"
210,How Many Tries Do I Have To Enter My Pin Before I'M Blocked?,Considering this utterance: How Many Tries Do I Have To Enter My Pin Before I'M Blocked? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

This question is one that I am very often questioned about and the answer to it is not simple. It seems that in many cases when people first hear the question it seems to confuse a lot of people. They think that there is only one possible solution for the problem. If that were the truth then there would be a single correct answer, but this question can have any number of very different answers depending on which one best represents the intended meaning of the utterances in the context. In this post I would like to attempt to describe the nature and scope of what is involved and to provide the reader with a method of understanding the range of potential answers to this very simple question.
There are two basic approaches to describing the scope and nature of this sort of question or statement. One is what I have called the 'word-level' approach and in this approach the sentence is parsed as if it were a paragraph of text that consists of words that make up phrases, and within those phrases words are grouped together to form larger chunks. Then the larger phrases are examined to see how they are used to construct larger units. This method is very much like sentence analysis, as described by Fowler in his classic work, The King's English. Here is an example of an analysis that he describes:
'The man is tall, he is short, his height is 5 feet 6 inches, the distance is 1 yard.' So we have a series of phrases that are being used in a specific order to build a larger statement or a thought. There are some other elements of sentence structure and grammar that come into play as well. The second is a more 'phrase level' analysis. With this method the focus is on individual units of speech like individual phrases. Phrases are then examined individually and then the analysis proceeds as is done by looking at phrases individually. So, using Fowler's example: 'The tall man and short man both stand 1 yd' from each other, where the subject of each clause is 'tall' and'short'.
A third, more recent and comprehensive model of how to approach such a question was described in 'How Many? The Phrase Level Approach' by the great linguist Stephen Halliday, which I highly recommend you read and consider. As you do so you should see that the first of these models"
211,What Should I Do If I'Ve Tried To Enter My Pin Too Often?,Considering this utterance: What Should I Do If I'Ve Tried To Enter My Pin Too Often? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?
I think the answer is that the speaker is looking for advice on what to do with an activity that is not working, that they are not interested in continuing, and that will end sooner or later, either because of an increase in frequency or because there just comes a point when they will not be able to continue due to lack of interest.
If it is just something you do to pass the time, the phrase is about the activity itself. 
This is in contrast to if a person said:

The question is: Do you think I should do this?  or
Do you have this kind of problem? or,
Is there something I can do about it? Or any of those other examples where there is a specific need. In these examples, intent is to seek advice and the question can be answered as either ""yes"" or ""no""."
212,I Have Exceeded The Number Of Times I Can Try My Pin,Considering this utterance: I Have Exceeded The Number Of Times I Can Try My Pin What is the intent that best describes it?,"(e.g., I’ve tried it, I tried this, etc.)?”

If you answered that your intent is “I‘ve exceeded the number of times I can try my pin,“ then you would be right. (The phrase has been used this way in written form to a number, but not necessarily to one!)
This would mean that what you tried was indeed this particular pin you were wearing. And that you did it more than once.
Note that this phrase is not only commonly used in writing, (and not just in the United States) but even in spoken speech in many languages. 
(In my opinion the phrase means more, or better, than the more common ‘I have used my last try.‛)"

214,What Do I Do If The Bank Machine Won'T Accept My Pin Attempts Anymore?,Considering this utterance: What Do I Do If The Bank Machine Won'T Accept My Pin Attempts Anymore? What is the intent that best describes it?,": the most common is ""I'd better."" It's the same thing in most every language. There's a reason: When we use the words ""would"" and ""better"" to describe how we feel, we are expressing a choice in the future.

How about ""Do I dare ask this of the Bank or do I give in and do the math myself?""
When we have a situation in life and we choose to act or not act, this is expressing what we believe we can or can't do. It is an opinion we hold about what is possible or possible. The words we put in our mouth are a reflection of what are really our true feelings, but we try to be polite to get around our feelings and tell the truth when we think someone would be able to help us."

A:

216,How Do I Deal With A Blocked Pin?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Deal With A Blocked Pin? What is the intent that best describes it?,", or a statement?

How do I deal with a blocked pin? is about how and what to do when you get a flat tire. I think the answer is pretty clear. If it’s a simple question then it could be a query, and maybe a short question, too.
But this one feels like a full-fledged sentence; so a main-sentence question. That might give us a clue. It says: I want to understand the structure of this sentence, so I can figure out what it says, about what is going on. This is a complex utterances, not a question-answer, nor is it really a definition, since it doesn”t give the definition of “deal with.“ Instead it is just part of the context of something. To me at least it implies that this person has no experience of dealing with blocked tires. She wants to know more about that, how that person deals with it. Perhaps the question may actually be: ”What do you do if you have a tire that just isn‘t spinning, no matter what?‚Äù
A ‚¦What‛ question would then be something like: You want me to explain how to deal if a tyre isn't rotating? That would be much easier to answer. A full sentence answer would probably not make sense. 
So how can we classify this question: What do i do to fix a pin. The only thing I get is that it isn;t a „What,„‹ because ’t isn'› a word. But this doesn't mean we are done. Let's take a look at the part ‛‍ do i, what i‖ . Is it a yes, question? Not really. †It does express a state of knowing, of being ready and able to respond. As such the state is one of understanding. We can say a sentence like ‘I want a cookie‌‗ is asking someone for something in the present tense. When a person understands you are asking them for a food they know how you could have made them happy. In the same way a good question is something that lets you understand that you want some information. You know that the person is able"

This data includes all the cards that have a name, the date they were blocked, and the amount of the payment that was blocked. This will give you an approximation of how much you might be able to unblock your card, but remember that you cannot access your bank balances until your account is unlocked. To unlock your credit card we need access to your financial records. For example, if you have your last statement or check in your possession you can use that to unlock or un-lock your payment. The card may need to be physically present with you when we unlock it and verify your identity.
If you've had problems accessing your cards, we're happy to help. We can unlock payment, credit, or debit card accounts in a few steps:

You cannot try a pin that you already have in hand so #4 is a possibility. But it would be a bit unusual to give your reason in this manner. You might just reply I have already tried this pin on this type of clothing but if you have no specific reason to mention, just give it as #1, #2 or #3.

Consider this other utterances as well:

What does your response tell you of its intent? Does it sound different than if we were asked, ‘What do you think of the weather?”
“Why are you not married? Do you have a boyfriend? Have you been divorced? Divorce is so easy. ‘
Are these questions asking the same thing, or does each question imply something different? How do the questions imply or imply that we are interested in the answers, if the word, questions implies questions? (Note that I use implication rather than ask to show a change of intent)
In the following examples, the phrase implies that the answer is important, while the question implies, that it is not. (If you disagree that there are questions that imply a lack of importance to the information, please explain. Otherwise, I will be sure that you are wrong.)
You Should Go. You Should Come.You Can Come or You Can Stay. Why Aren‛t You at Your Work?  Why Do We Go to Work Today? You Look Good In that Dress. 
The last two utterings in this set ask if someone is going somewhere, and why, respectively.

A:
The intent of ""unblock my pin"" is that the person wants to be allowed to get into a certain area of the school (or any other place).  They want to enter but the administrator or security guard won't let them in because they need to have a specific PIN code to gain access.

As I said at the outset, this is simply a way of thinking about the way people express thoughts. I’m not trying to give you the formula that will guarantee you can do so. But if you think of your writing as the attempt to understand the thoughts that are coming into your head, then you may find the insights that follow to have some use in helping you express the ideas that matter to your readers best. This is only my theory, so feel free to experiment to see what works for you. If some ideas seem to work well, you could even use this to help you write new blog topics. That‗and the fact that writing well makes one a better reader—is the real reason to write. You are trying your best in all you do, and that‘s what counts. So what do I think is going on when you read a sentence like this? Here it goes. Let‛s begin with how the language was originally written. It appears to me that the intention is to communicate that you‚ve tried and it has not worked; that is, the problem is you, not the pin, when it comes to inserting that thing. However, by writing the first two (or three) words together, instead of separate, we have to change our interpretation of what the author is trying tell us. Since we are used to reading a word as one, that changes the meaning of this sentence. Now if we read it this way, does that mean it”s not a complete thought? No, no it doesn“t. And it would have been a more effective statement if it had been written this… The original thought seems more complete to us, even if there are no more actual words than in the two examples above: This thought is a bit more"

It’s very interesting that we have a ‘can‘ in that sentence. A simple can to a large can that needs to be opened to remove the obstruction. The can is ‚opened‛; and what happens to the contents is that a person, or something else, is then able to enter. In this case this is a metaphor. It is like a pin blocking the entrance to my brain. I want this pin to get rid of the block. And I know that you CAN (the can) remove it, but are you going to?
This is what the English dictionary has to say about a can: „The can has been used as food storage, for drink, etc.; it is also found at the bottom of a barrel or keg. Used also in the sense that any object of this kind is to have its obstructing substance removed,“ – Cambridge Dictionaries Online.
‚Open the can you„ is an idiom; it means to open something up. When we use it this means that something has the power to release, i.e. remove, the obstructions. †
We use a word to convey the idea that the ’can will be removed‟. We could just say: I can‰t seem to move the pin that is blocking my entrance or ” I cannot seem-to›, and then say that it should be unblocked. This is because when we want to indicate a desire to un-block something is when it uses two parts of speech, such as:
I‪ ‫can ‬ ‪‫‬, ‏(I can),
can - (can), ″‹something ‹that does the
blocking of your brain - that should do the blocking. If I had the word for this, that was ‌※the ‭that-that‭, then I would say in this sentence:  The block-can-should -the-pin-unblock!

What is the intent that best describes it?,"and what is its function in the discourse? (If you haven't gotten your pin, try your phone number and see if you get a phone call)

This post is a response to a question on Quora about whether or not you can try pin too long, or too frequently.
The Quoted Question and My Answer:
Question: Is it possible to have your password ""try too many times"" blocked for you?
Answer: Yes. In a way. There is actually a method that a certain set of computers can use. These are computers that are running on the internet and therefore have a public IP address. If you have been doing the same thing, trying to login with a same combination of username and password on a site with an account that has too few attempts per hour, and if the IP you are associated with is on this block list, you will simply not be allowed to enter the site. You will see the login screen with your username, but instead of a field to put in your info you'll be presented with the following message: “Your PIN is blocked.”
You can also set up a rule on your iPhone and other Apple devices. Once you put your iCloud account information in, the device can be used to set how often, if ever, your account can have too much attempts made against it. This has the side effect of not letting you reset it to your usual settings once it reaches the limit. However you set it, be prepared for the frustration that can come with having one's account locked out of the normal use it normally gets. (I have done this myself.)
So, this is not so far off of what some other Quorasites are saying: it is possible but it's not a ""standard"" block. It would be nice to see a standard set-up for ""block too often"" (or ""too few times in an hour"") but so much of it relies on IPs and DNS records that I guess that's just not practical. As to the method, I have used it myself. I tried to access the Apple Store for an iPad a couple of years ago but I was on someone else's IP (and it was at a time when there were very little ""tries"" allowed on my account). It didn't ask me for a new pin or"

If this sentence, and any of the others below is unclear to you, go back and re-read the questions. This is not an exercise in grammar.
This list is made up of a selection of sentences I've found on internet that are good for getting you to reread, think about, or consider the question. I have included a few that I think are unclear, because I believe that some of their meanings can be improved upon using a different phrase, sentence or word. So read each one carefully; reword them if one is needed; see if you can come up with your own answers for them. Try a sentence on different people: ""What does this phrase suggest?""

  My sister is pregnant. How is this possible?  
  The world is round. You're going to fall off if I let go.  What can I do?

 This phrase suggests the idea that if a person can do something, then it is possible. We usually use that kind of statement when we're trying to get someone to do a little something they haven't done before. The phrase ""what can we do?"" has the meaning ""How can it be possible?"" It's used to imply that it's not possible or even likely. ""Can we try to accomplish [x]?"" or ""We're not likely to [try to] accomplish this.""

 My friend and I are very different. She is outgoing, but I'm more reserved. Which one am I? I am.

 If one person is much more social, outgoing and fun, than the other, we can say she has 'high self esteem'. If the outgoing person thinks of herself as'more reserved', that is, more self-conscious, shy, etc., we could call it 'low self awareness'.

Perhaps you can find someone else who shares a common interest and start a new conversation. Maybe you could invite your friend over for lunch. Or you are welcome to call your best friend. In my book I would suggest you call the other person and share what you have observed with them. If they feel it is important, they can decide what to do about it; or they too may decide to not engage with you about this situation. At the least they could offer their support to help you with your own decision making process about what will happen next. There could be other outcomes, but I don‚t think your Pin needs to be blocked."

I want the answer to be expressed in a single word, a word that means the same to all speakers, or a group of words that mean this same thing.  I have seen the words:  unblocked, unblock and blocked.

A:
There is no one right way to do this. If you're asking about what ""unblock"" means, you have to determine that based on context. In my opinion, the phrase ""Can I un-block my pin"" most strongly means that the person is not going to allow the PIN they gave you to block them. I also find this more likely in the US than in some other countries."
234,How Do I Unblock My Pin?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Unblock My Pin? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? I can imagine that you'd think the speaker is asking the computer to find and remove an entry that the listener might use to block the pin. The speaker probably meant to ask what he or she should do to unblock the card. You can use the verb ""unblock"" to express the same meaning.

What do you make of this word? This one sounds pretty straightforward. I think you know what it's going to mean. If the phrase means, How do I find this out?, then you can replace the word ""find"" with ""learn,"" and the meaning still holds good. But you could say the first half of the clause is a statement of fact, and you're probably not interested in learning it. So what's it doing there? Here's my guess: Maybe the author was trying to communicate a fact in a way that sounded a little more formal. In other words, Maybe he wanted to imply that there's a hidden secret in the system that's worth the trouble of learning."

237,"Since My Pin Is Blocked, Would You Help Me Unblock It?","Considering this utterance: Since My Pin Is Blocked, Would You Help Me Unblock It? What is the intent that best describes it?","? If you guessed ""I can't get my pin blocked!"", then you're on the right track. You can say anything you wish about that state, but the real reason it's blocked is irrelevant, so the fact that you can find something to say about it is no guarantee it will change.

You're using your imagination to fill in the blanks, which shows you've already realized that there's no good reason for the pin to be blocked. I'm not saying the reason is not there, I am saying you cannot find it. If something has a reason to exist, then it can be used to determine whether something truly exists. The only thing left to do, is use your reason. Once you do that, your pin is going to unfreeze. Or rather, it won't be frozen anymore. It'll be un-pinned. Whatever the case, you'll have to think up a new reason yourself. In other words, think what you really want to get out of all this and try to find words to express that. Don't try it before that though. Your reason can only be what the words are about. So what's yours?
It's about the frustration and embarrassment. When I get home after a few hours at my PC, the only way I can do something is if I use that specific pin that I made, and I have been blocked since a very long time ago. And to add the icing on top of the cake, when I try this on another network at the same location, this doesn't happen. This makes me feel frustrated and embarrassed. 
This is also a way of making the other person feel bad, that if he/she doesn’t help me un block the connection to that pin, he will suffer and feel embarrassed for himself. Which, of course, would be false, since he is at no fault, being it the network administrator who is supposed to look into this case. Yet, for me, as well as for those who want or need to have free access to my internet service, my experience is that this is a good way to make the person do what I want them to and in order to not feel humiliated and bad."

242,What Is Required Documents For New Card Process ?,Considering this utterance: What Is Required Documents For New Card Process ? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Considering this utterance: What Is Required Documents For New Card Process?. What is the intent that best describes it expressed as a phrase of one or two words? What are some synonyms and antonyms for this word? The first thing comes to our mind when we hear this term is that ""it is required"". So it could be possible that the term should come from the Latin word: Requiritas meaning required to do something. But why is this so?

What is Required in English? :
To get the complete meaning, the root word'required' could mean something to be done, something that is necessary for something and something, that should be given, a requirement.
Now we understand this more in detail: When a student wants to enter a university, he/she has to submit a list of documents like the passport and the degree certificate or the marks/score card of the exam. There might be some other forms of required document that we don't know. These forms are needed for a particular course/degree or a specific application process for admission/admission to the university. All these processes require something from us and if the document required is in a wrong place or in bad conditions or if we have given false information regarding the required documents then there would be a problem, and this could lead to a failure or rejection from that particular process. This might happen because the requirement of that document has become a document, not because of anything else. Now the question is how does this happen? I think it happens when there is a discrepancy between something or someone and what's required or required by someone else and when this happens it changes the status of this thing from something which is not required into something required. The root of it is 'Requirement'.
So, we could say that 'the document is being required'. Or'something is requiring that'. So, in both these sentences, it means the same thing. We could also say something is needed and it becomes required, for example, you are required that you submit the report by a due date. You may say 'you need' instead. It's all about the 'need' or 'want' that someone has. Sometimes it's a 'thing' which someone wants and in such cases the word for describing this 'object' as required comes from Latin:'requiritās'. This Latin term has been adopted by the English language in the sense given earlier in this post too."
243,"I Don'T Know What'S Wrong, My Contactless Stopped Working.

Tried It In A Few Different Places Today And It Didn'T Work In Any Of Them. What is the intent that best describes it?","?

What is it that we're doing? What are we trying to express with this sentence (of just one word or fewer, that is, no modifiers)? That statement contains no negations, nor is there an implied question, so, in a way, it is a ""sentence fragment"" (one of the very common forms of sentences that may be used in place of full sentences).
For the example sentence, I'm thinking ""to get it working,"" since the word to indicates it, along with not working. The speaker's contactless card, therefore, isn't working because there's an issue with either the device or the card - but it's not clear which.
To get a clearer picture of what the speaker means, the phrase I don't know what's wrong could also translate as ""I can't tell you what it could be,"" which suggests that there could well be a technical problem with the hardware or software of a contact card reader. Alternatively, there might be problems with a network connection that connects to the reader and the contactor's card. There also might not be an error in the software that reads cards (a contact reader) or in that which processes information (the contact writer, etc). There are many things that could go wrong. In any case, a question mark could indicate the possibility that the issue is not in either contact readers or writers."

The intent of this question appears to be: Why can't I use these new ""contactless"" cards with contact cards? It does not appear to include the other subtypes: ""I am curious"", ""Why did you say ____?"", or the ""What is _____?"" subtype.

245,I Tried To Pay Contactless At The Bus Today And It Didn'T Work. Any Ideas Why?,Considering this utterance: I Tried To Pay Contactless At The Bus Today And It Didn'T Work. Any Ideas Why? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I would say the most likely candidate is ""attempted"". As in, I attempted to..., which is to say, there was an attempt; it did not succeed, but there is a record of the attempt.
It's a very odd word to use for a single action, however. I would not use the verb ""try"" to describe an action that does not happen at least several times (i.e., ""did not go"" or ""faulty"") or a singular result that is not necessarily an ""error"" (e.g., did it actually work? - I guess not).
If you really wanted to get into the nuances of it, you could be looking at the following words:
1.) try, tried, and attempts. There are three different meanings. Try is used as an infinitive to mean that you are attempting to do something, or the result of such an effort. ""He tried to jump the wall and fell backwards.""
Tried means that the thing has been attempted several different ways, all of which failed (as in a trial). It is generally used to discuss what happens when attempting an activity, rather than what happened during the activity. This can be useful if the ""activity"" is actually a series of actions rather one action. E.G. He tried (attemted) to play golf, he tried again, then he succeeded. Tries are usually followed by a list of things that happened after the initial attempt (the wall did indeed appear to break his fall). ""She tried running, she tried swimming, her attempt failed."" THe list can include actions that did occur, such as the swimming action (she tried). If the list is incomplete (or the action occurred before the try-attemp) and the person says ""I tried [verb] this morning, what did you do?"" you can use tried as part of a verb-list construction that implies the failure. It could also imply the successful attempt, of course. (I think you would be a bit confused by the phrase ""to try"" as it implies that there would actually be an ongoing effort, even if it is ultimately unsuccessful.) THey could mean ""Didn't I try that last week? What did I do this week"

What is the intent that best describes it?,"? What would be an example of such a description of that particular thought or concept?

A:
There are two verbs: to pay and to be. The first one describes an action or event, the second word describes a quality. So the whole sentence is about an activity or being. There isn't really a better way to express that, it's not possible to make a list of all possible phrases.
The most common ways of doing this are: (I can't use links because I don't have enough reputation, they will open in new tabs anyway)
to pay, to use: 
I cannot use my Visa card or Mastercard or American Express as they are not accepted at the place where I bought the goods. If I try to buy anything they won't accept them."

""I'm not doing this.""   ""Why won't it work?""

The phrase is intended to express incredulity and indignation.  Why? What's the cause of it? Am I mistaken to consider it an expression of incredulous disbelief?
What is a good way to communicate to an acquaintance who is in a situation where one should contact someone by card? (initiate the conversation with the other party, get their attention, give the question)
If a user were in this situation, and the card would be accepted, but then suddenly wouldn't work, would 'it won' work for you?' work? Is 'won't' a word used in place of the word 'would/could' when one does not know if 'you' would/would not be able to accept/complete the action? If so, is this a more accurate representation of a real word? I'm using the words that come to mind.
Are these two phrases:  1) ""It won 't work"" and 2)  'It's not working"" interchangeable? That is, can an English speaker use  2 as 2a), replacing the 'not workin' (a verb) with a noun or an adjective: ""it's work 'in'"" - a.k.a. ""work 'n'""?  I don't know the difference between the two; and what it is that a person should do in the situation in question to ensure that it works/work in. The situation may be: it doesn't accept my card, or,  it didn' accept it, when it should have. But how can I confirm if a card is accepted or not. (What can someone say for example, to a salesperson, 'I'll pay with card; can you check if it's accepted?'. How can the sales person do that?)  In other words, it could be (1): ""Can you look for it in my hand/wallet, as if you are looking for a coin?"" or (2):  Is there any other expression that could do the equivalent for either 1 and/or 2?

What can I do?""
Here, I would put ""For Some reason"" as the first phrase. Then I put the second phrase as ""I don' t know"", which I see as one thought. And then I end up with
For Something reason My contact...
In a sense, this can be seen as two phrases connected by a conjunction. So what I want is to have this phrase connected to the next phrase by another conjunction (I think it has to be the conjunction ""and"", but I haven't checked). But in order for this to happen, the two parts of it have to start with the same word (and also the words that are the subject and the object of the verb, and any other prepositions if there are any). So the best is I think, is, ""some reason why"".
Is this something like what you are suggesting in the title, that ""a reason phrase has two things to it"". But then you would see that in a sentence like the above, there is no subject, no verb and no complement. Or is it something more like ""Some Reason Why My...
The reason being (if this is what it means), then this would make sense. You just put, for some or for whatever reason, followed by the rest of your sentence and then close it with a semicolon. Here is how I like to think about the sentence that you have written, with my comments and suggestions: 
I am thinking a reason and some why. Why is not the focus here. In fact, when you think or write ""for some reasons,"" you don’t actually mean for certain reasons. There is some ambiguity. For is just a word that is used because it can mean ""in order to"" (as in, you go"
251,"I Couldn'T Use My Contactless This Morning, It Wasn'T Accepted.","Considering this utterance: I Couldn'T Use My Contactless This Morning, It Wasn'T Accepted. What is the intent that best describes it?","? Is it:

I could not use my contactless (card) this morning, it was not accepted...
  
OR
... I was unable to use contactlessly this mornign (not a good phrase) because it could only be used in specific environments.
This is a common situation where one is asked to pay with cash/debit. The card/contactless is then not valid.  This has happened to me before, in a different country and the only way I found around that was to ask for my PIN number. (I have since become used to having to remember it) Is this normal?  I have never seen this before. Was it that I did not understand the question?
Thanks
Clarification:  If I asked ""Can I use this today"", what could be implied is that my card was accepted. That is what this question is about. I understand that it's not an easy topic to understand as many card companies require that merchants have this capability or not. This is not about that. It is simply about me being unable/unable to. Please do not assume the above. Thanks
Update: After the comments, I guess I should give more information about my question. My point is in this situation, where I am not using my Contact Less Card, the card company wants to see the PIN for confirmation. So the problem is me or the environment. If the company can see what is going on with the transaction, they can do whatever they want. In this case, to get my point across, there should be a better way of asking the merchants to allow my credit card to be ""unaccepted"".
My country, Australia, uses contact less payments. However, when a cashier cannot accept my Card (because the cash register only has a touch screen and not touch less) I must provide my Pin or wait to buy something else, which could have been a nice way to spend my money. A merchant may see that there is something wrong with this transaction and call the bank to find out. Then the merchant is forced to provide the pin. There are some cards that have a card reader on the back for cashiers and a PIN on a label so the customer is able to confirm the correct PIN. They usually cost about a hundred dollars"

253,Why Wouldn'T The Contactless Payment Work When I Tried To Pay At The Bus Today?,Considering this utterance: Why Wouldn'T The Contactless Payment Work When I Tried To Pay At The Bus Today? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

If it is a statement that expresses one intent with two clauses, then it needs something that connects the clauses in order for them to make sense
For example: (I will not tell you that because I am keeping a secret from you)
This sentence is ambiguous because its intended meaning is two things that are contradictory. If you were to ask me something then the statement may be interpreted as ""I have said that and now I will tell something else""
or "" I'm saying I won't tell and at the same time telling you"".
A better version would probably be "" ""
Another example of a double-dichotomy:
""You have to know when to hold'em   "" = a choice with no choice
So, I have an idea to write a program to solve double dilemmas, however I need to figure out the grammar first. Any ideas on how to approach it? Thanks.
(Also the program is written in python, if thats useful for your answer) 
Update:  This question is being asked to find out what type of double dichotomy I was talking about. It is not actually asking what is grammatically correct to use. I know there are more than two ways to express things, but that is all I asked. In fact the question was asked out of curiosity to see if there was any double dilemma or not. The reason why I thought it was a question that needs answer is because it came out as such in the comments and was not addressed.  I should have been clearer. This is what the original question said: What grammatical form is this? This example I provided is merely a way of illustrating the two parts of the sentence that I think I can connect with a grammatic choice. As an illustration of what I want the final answer to look like. (Thanks @daniel-lindgren for the answer that solved my initial problem) I now have a better understanding of it and my problem was solved. And I still need help with the ""How do I find the correct grammatical way to phrase this question?"" part of this post, though. Thanks for any help. Cheers."
254,How Do I Check My Security Settings To Allow Contactless Pay?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Check My Security Settings To Allow Contactless Pay? What is the intent that best describes it?,"with at least an average of 50 tokens in each of its lexical fields?

There are two ways in order to achieve this in OpenIE. You can either use an existing tagger or you can build it from scratch.
For the first approach, we have three possible options:
• a single tag,
– a two tags, one for each word in ""How Do i Check my Security settings""
or
­­– an NLP-sentence. This tag will be the most likely choice because the sentence will have been tagged as one. However in that case, the ""Do"" tag could be a tag of the following structure: do-det-noun-nn-mod. So we could also tag the word as: (do (det (n (nn (mod (NOMINATIVE)))))))
The second approach would be to build this tag from the original sentence. Let us take the example of ""What does the man have in his hand?"" The following code would tag all the words in the question with the given tag: What_does the_man_have_in_his_hand_(det_N_NN_P_V_3f)?
What_Does_The_Man_Have_In_His_Hand_(n_Det_PN _v_4f) ::= What (Does) { [What] [Noun] (the [Man] {[Has] the [Hand] in [His]})}
It is important to notice that the taggers are quite powerful in tagging and that they don't always provide the right context to understand the meaning of a particular element. For that we need domain expertise. The tag above is an example: the noun is ""Man"" and the verb is of course ""Have"". For the Noun, ""Does"" are used and for the Verb, there is a ""v"" at the end. ""Det"" is also used to indicate that there are three adjectives that describe the object in question. Finally, it can be noted that it has been assigned the modality. It is likely that for this particular question ""modality"" could have a value of 3f and ""Polarity"" might have an opposite meaning.

256,Fix My Contactless,Considering this utterance: Fix My Contactless What is the intent that best describes it?,"and what is it not saying?

The intent is: To fix contactless credit/debit cards and other electronic devices to make them functional.
What is not being said is that it is for a card-based payment system. That is being taken for granted. Also, the ""fix"" would normally refer to the problem that caused it to be non-functional, not to an actual hardware fix or the solution itself
Fix My iPhone, for example. This is saying ""Fix my iPhone to use this service so I can fix the device, which is a problem I've had and will be having again"".
Another example is Fix my car. You have a car that does not work correctly. The intent would generally be something like ""I have to fix it so it does so as expected"". The device itself is already working. It is assumed that you want things as they were before. There is nothing about what a ""hardware fix"" is."

As a quick recap, a Contact-less payment card is a card that is not linked directly to a specific merchant account. That is to say, the merchant doesn’t actually know who has purchased the card. Instead, he just knows the number on the back of it. Contact free payment cards were created, with the intention of providing a better alternative for the “card not present” transaction methods. These contact-free cards are often used for retail purchases. For example, you might go to the grocery store and swipe your card for your grocery purchase. The payment company doesn't actually verify the purchase, rather, it just gives you cash back in your bank account (via your payment processor) in return for using your credit card to process the transaction. This is also commonly used as the method for online purchases (e.g., a credit-card is used to purchase a product but the payment isn‘t handled by the original merchant, but rather by an online merchant like Amazon, eBay, or Apple. In fact, some companies, specifically Visa for instance, have an ”online store“, which is simply a website and a contact free (aka ‘contactless‌‍ ‬‏  card ‰ ‖     ‐free   ‥—‹‡‫‚„›‼‛'‧‾‽‵‸‒‗†‱‭)‪•‣․…※‶‮‷ ″‿‴―‟​′–‑‎’� 蛇),‶�,‫�) payment option in addition to their traditional „card-present‚非 card-purchase option. ‣ ‹ ‰ › ‽ ’ ‚ ‛ ‵ ‸ ‒ ‗ † ‑ ‐ ′ – ‖ ‮ ″ ‴ ― ‍ ‏ ‬ ‿ ․"

The term contact is used as it relates to a technology, and contactable is something that can be contacted in the literal sense, or used to refer to being in contact with someone or some place, etc. This is a specific meaning that has nothing to do with the meaning of contact in ""I want someone to call me, if I do not answer please call again tomorrow"" context.

263,The Nfc Payment Wouldn'T Work On The Bus Today. Help?,Considering this utterance: The Nfc Payment Wouldn'T Work On The Bus Today. Help? What is the intent that best describes it?,", and why?
I'll take your word, ""Nfc"" for granted. But what's the phrase's purpose? To help me understand it better? Or to be a test for this lesson? I'm sorry - I was unclear in my question.

A:
The phrase means, literally, that the NFC payment system wouldn't work on the bus. You have to remember that it is a shortened version of ""non-federated payment"".  
This is because non-Federations is an important word in the world of finance.  The ""federation"" is like ""the union of the states that make up the United States of America"". This union is important for a number of reasons. The first is that, when one of these states decides to do things different from other states, it can cause trouble, such as the Civil War. (The ""States"" refers to the US, but I guess they could mean the EU here)  This is one example:  the federal government of Australia has different financial arrangements from the other 50 states of which it (partly) comprises, in part because the state with the most people has the highest per capita income, giving it more power and making it possible for it to have different laws than the others. That means that Australians who move to any of those 50 different states must do so on a case by case basis, looking at what laws there are in their new state. This can mean that one state has its own currency (ie the Australian Dollar is different to what the people in other parts of The Union use) or that a state might allow gambling or might not, the laws governing financial institutions might be different, etc. So, even though it would be easy to say that ""Australia doesn't really have a single currency any more"" that is not the case. There are two kinds of currency. And, as part of its union, Australia does have some laws about what currencies people can use, what people need to convert into that currency, how much those currencies can be traded for, or not - and all that. It is easy, then, for the Aussie to ""go overseas"" to buy something with an Australian currency but there is no easy way for an expat to get Australian money to pay in for something in say - Germany"

A:

265,How Do I Make Contactless Work,Considering this utterance: How Do I Make Contactless Work What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Is this phrase about a specific product, or a product that does a certain task? It's about Contact Lenses?

If we analyze this sentence, how does the verb ""Work"" change the meaning of the statement? Does it mean contact lenses? The sentence ""Contact lenses work fine on my eyes"" says that contact lens don't work at all. The subject of contact lense ""work"" is ""eyes"", and ""my"" describes the speaker.
I know that the noun ""contact lens"" cannot be the subject. But in the sentence that I have mentioned, the ""make contacts work"" could be about the contact of contacts or it could mean to ""connect"" contacts to the lens. How does it work? What's the best way to make a sentence about contact to lenses more clear? 
Please help to correct my mistakes.   Please help me in making the sentences more understandable, for example, ""My eyes feel better with contacts than without.""
Thank you in advance.!
PS: I'm not a native speaker, I would greatly appreciate if you help with my mistake. Sorry!  (Sorry for my bad English too)
EDIT: If the question is not clear (I have written the original question too fast), please let me know. I will re-write the post. Thank you very much! :-)
Sorry! The question was wrong and confusing. ""How to use the phrase'make contact work' more effectively""?
The phrase is how do I make my contacts (in other words, lenses) work. If I want to talk about contacts, then I should not talk the word ""lenses"" at first. It is about my contact, my ""contacts work""!
""My contacts"" can be either contact and then ""do work""? or contact ""works"" and can ""have work"". If we make the first choice, we should say, contacts ""are working"". But if we choose the second option, as ""the contact works"" (which is right), I don´t know the correct expression. In fact, these two options are almost synonymous. Please tell me. Is it okay to choose either one? Thanks! :)

267,The Contactless I Have Won'T Work.,Considering this utterance: The Contactless I Have Won'T Work. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The answer is, as with any other utterances, to be discerned from the context in which it is spoken or written:
1. The intent is to express a statement of fact
2. It is used with a question mark
3. There is a suggestion of an implication that this statement is false or misleading
4. This utterace is being used for rhetorical rather than informational purposes
5. No other reasonable interpretation is available
6. You could not reasonably infer that there exist any additional, less extreme, alternatives that would be more likely to accurately express the speaker’s intent.
7. If any alternative interpretation can more accurately and clearly express his meaning, why was he not using that alternative?  
8.  If no other interpretation, reasonably apparent in context, could be construed to more clearly reflect his intended meaning more obviously he should have said or spelled that interpretation  rather that say what he did."
268,Why Isn'T My Contactless Not Working?,Considering this utterance: Why Isn'T My Contactless Not Working? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? I suggest that it is ""I have been waiting for you to come here, and you haven't, so I am disappointed."" I'm a bit hesitant, however, to use the term ""hurt"" to describe what the person is saying. It might be better to see it as the result of a ""wonder"" - or a sense of bewilderment. I also think that we have a very limited way in which to express what is essentially an inner experience; so it's more of an attempt than a fully-formed statement.

So, the phrase ""Why Isn't My (contactlessly) Not Workin', Man?"" is more apt than ""why does this always happen to me/my family/the people I know?"" as an opening phrase. (I've been using ""contactless"" instead of ""RFID"", because I find that word more understandable and less intimidating than the long form of the word: RF-ID.)
""Why don't you just use a card?"" This is a valid response. If you want contactless, it must be a contact-free device, right? Why not just give the user a credit card?
If you have an iPhone, you can use ""Wallet"" on that. You can sync it with ""Citibank"" (your financial institution; or whatever one you chose). You will have the same benefits of no-tethering, no contact and no card (except the one used to sync the device with the wallet service provider).
However, if you are not an American, or are one of those people who are very uncomfortable with paying for things by credit or debit card; in that case, there are apps that will do the job. There is no shortage in the market for such apps. Some require that you carry your own phone with an appropriate card reader. Others require nothing more than your existing contact/debit cards. Still others just need a phone number that can be used for ""authorization"" of your credit/bank card. All of these require a SIM card, which is not necessarily required to have contact free functionality. But they are also quite useful for other reasons. For instance, I have two credit cards, one with American Express, another with Union Bank of Switzerland. Each of them has an app to which we can send an SMS-based"

270,It Didnt Work When I Tried To Pay Contactless At The Bus Today. Why?,Considering this utterance: It Didnt Work When I Tried To Pay Contactless At The Bus Today. Why? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

It's a very difficult question.
The problem is that the term 'intent' can mean very different things. One could talk about a person's state of mind, and if they think about doing something, then they might actually do it even if their state is completely different right after. That can cause people to get really confused, because their'state of intent' is not the same thing as the 'intention' as it can be seen from another person. It is much easier to understand this if you think of someone who is 'thinking about something' and then'suddenly decides' to do this, even though they haven't intended to. They might just 'forget' about what they were thinking about when they suddenly decided to act on it. (The fact that it might be very, very confusing for the other party is probably the main reason why it didn't work at the time. But it still makes it more difficult.)
So in your case:
If you were actually in a bad state at when you tried to buy something from a bus, you might not even think that you'll buy anything, that's probably why you didn;t buy. The only thing you can do then is to ask yourself if there were some external factors which made you forget about your intent. Maybe you got into a discussion with friends or something like that, or you just found something very funny. And the only way you know what caused it is if someone tells you. 'The thing is, it was because I had just started to think something when I decided not to'. (In this example, the person was talking about himself, but it's the exact same idea.) Now if this doesn't help to clarify, maybe you ask someone if he has been on the bus. Then you check if it could be the reason that he hasn't bought anything. You ask: ""Did it work for you when buying something at a different time?"". And if the answer is yes, this could help you to see that maybe something similar happened for your friend."
271,I Am Not Able To Do Contactless.,Considering this utterance: I Am Not Able To Do Contactless. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

If you have watched a lot of TV and listened to a good amount of rap, you would recognize the phrase: “I’m not able to do contactless”. It is uttered by rappers who are trying to sound tough in a way that is believable, as it is often in music videos. There are a few different ways that the same phrase could be said:
– I‘m able do something.
I ‘am able“- to-do something or to have something done to me/by me. (This would be more likely to be used in the context of physical contact, rather than contactlessly.)
-I am ”
to-be-able-to‟
do„ somethingor tohave somethingdone tome or byme.‹(This sounds very much like being able.) I am able „to ‹do ″something. This would often sound more like ‚do-contact‚. However, this is somewhat awkward, and would probably not work in this context. Perhaps more so, because it implies there is something to contact. That something is what the ’do part is.

272,How Do I Use Contactless Payments?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Use Contactless Payments? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The correct answer is: ""I want to see it in action.""
What is an example of a more complex phrase that would express this same intent? (You could think of complex phrases, but the question does not explicitly ask for these. This is why it's up to you to choose the phrases from your mind that are the only options for your answer:)
A couple of ideas:
""Do you sell anything else with contactless card?"" or ""Do your employees use contact with cards?""
If the answer to the first question is ""Yes, we do sell other services with it,"" the next questions may be:  
1/ ""Which of these services do you offer?""  or  // ""Does the rest of the business use a contact-free payment?"" //  I would recommend the last one.
2/ What do I do when I am there?  OR  What should I expect to be asked?"" (this is a good opportunity to mention the card itself: e.g. ""How does the contactcard look like? Are the cards different for my needs?"")"
273,Help Me With My Contactless Which Isn'T Working.,Considering this utterance: Help Me With My Contactless Which Isn'T Working. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

Help
me, I need help
with my contactless?...
contactless
working..
what?.. my
contacless working? I
don' t believe it..!
It
sounds too good to be true!...
The answer: I don't know
for sure, however, if you have
asked a more general question about
it, the answer will depend on the
kind and number of the phrases
that best describe it:
If it is a question of a general
question, a simple phrase that
expresses the question may be
used: “What is happening to
my contact?” or ”What's the best
way to contact my contacts? ’, ‘How
can I contact them?', ′When is
the best time to call?′, or others.
In case a very specific question
about the contact of specific
things is required, more detailed
phrases are appropriate, such
as ‚I have problem with my X,’
‚What can I do to solve the problem?,'„“‘Who can
help me?'„'What should I ask
to get this problem solved?. ‮,
'Where do I find my problem?' ‏, 'What
is the easiest solution to my concern?.
Answers to this question depends
on the type of phrases used. I have to give you a
general idea about this, and this is very
much a matter of style, depending
upon the culture in which you
want to convey your message. For
you, as for all other people, there is an
appropriate way to communicate
your idea and the context in
which it can be understood. In English a good
manner to ask for help is to say
something like:  ‭‭'Can I trouble you for
some help?' or
'someone, would you help me out?'
A very common phrase, in any
languages, is ‫Can you? or 
Can we? If you are not familiar
enough with the language in question the use of
a more polite form is preferable, even
if it might be more time"

I.e. I want the problem to be resolved.
This may be a short phrase. 
II.i. In my opinion the following would be more accurate because the speaker means that they are going to do their best. And I think this may not be an example of 'Fix', so we may need to find an alternative. (Or maybe not.)   Or, perhaps there is a better phrase to use which I am not aware of."
275,How Do I Use Contactless Pay?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Use Contactless Pay? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? 
This can be one of two things. Either   (a) it is a command for an employee  or a  request from an agent for something that the customer can do. Or  it can  be a request of  an  agent to an operator that they can provide a service.

A:
The first one, for instance, is what you do with the ""contactless credit/debit cards"" in the stores. They are the machines to put the credit card. There are many contactless cards but some require the use of the card reader attached. So, if the user has a card with a contact reader and is near one and wishes to ""pay"", she can just ""tap"" near her card and it will charge. (There's no physical transaction involved as there's a ""chip"" that is placed on the back of a credit, debit or prepaid card.)  The user just needs to have a reader, a phone/pDA with contact/contactlessness support, and she may have to tap her contactlessly enabled card on some machines.  However, it's all done remotely and the actual transaction can occur at other times. The machines themselves are usually in a secure area and not open to everyone. If the machine detects a problem it won't complete the transaction, so it may be used to ensure that a customer has the correct card, etc and also to help stop fraud. It's not like an actual point of sale machine. You don't ""check out"" with these machines - they are a way to make a transaction without needing to go to one physical location and wait."
276,How Do I Enable Contactless Pay?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Enable Contactless Pay? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

In this post I am going to answer that question using the Natural Language Processing tool for AI-enabled mobile wallets – Natural Chatbot.
I will start from the first intent mentioned in my previous post How To Use the Smart Contract to Store a Payment Address to a Wallet. I will use this intent as reference. The second intent will be discussed in this article.


Intent 1: ""How Do 
   I enable contactless  [pay]?"".
""How  would you like to pay, ma'am?""
This example describes an interaction when the customer enters his or her payment card into the wallet to transfer money. As you can see, both parties are communicating via the same platform, thus, the interaction is simple and the chatbot is performing the task that the user was expecting. In this example, I would not need to use natural language processing to enable the payment because it is a simple task.  If on the other hand, we have a customer that wants to buy something, but they would like the cashier to be able to verify that they are the rightful owner, then we would need natural chat processing. Natural language would be used to describe how the store owner would want to perform the verification process. If the transaction goes OK the natural response would come, ‘Great, your money is on its way.’ If there was a problem, such as the card is stolen, or someone else has tried to do the buy, natural natural processing would allow me to find out what was wrong with the purchase. Here is another example:  “How are you doing today, Mr. Smith?”
“I‘ve got the wrong _____. How would I get it changed? I„d like a refund please. Thank you. Please let me know when a technician has been dispatched as soon as possible, it‟s urgent. Thanks‚
[I don‭‬‌‪#‍ › ‡‫#].



 The problem with this interaction could be that if Mr Smith is not satisfied with his current state, he could ask to speak with a representative to complain about the service provided. This would lead me into having an internal conversation with my natural bot. My natural process would respond by asking him,"
277,Do I Need To Make A Regular Payment Before A Contactless One?,Considering this utterance: Do I Need To Make A Regular Payment Before A Contactless One? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?
What is it? Is it: Is the customer paying to be able to use contactless before making a payment? Or the best way to make a purchase is to have the purchase available in your wallet.

A:
I would think the second interpretation is better as contact-less payment is still an ""in your hands"" method, as payment will not have left the merchant until confirmation is provided.  A wallet would be similar, but in this case both parties could be confident payment was in the wallet before it's released."
278,How Can I Find Out Where My Contactless Works?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Find Out Where My Contactless Works? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
As a native speaker (from the UK) I would go for ""I am trying to find out how many times I can use a contactless card without it being deactivated"".  This is something that is a) happening NOW at this moment, and b) something I am doing, not a general question about what it is or can do.
If we change the question, ""What does it do"" becomes ""How can I check what my card does?"" which is not an interesting question for most readers unless your question is very specific in that context."
279,Should I Reinstall The Payment App?,Considering this utterance: Should I Reinstall The Payment App? What is the intent that best describes it?,".

In my humble opinion I think the phrase is, Should, I, Re install the Payment app? Which is to say, do I have a plan B. My first response is I don't have to, but in reality, that was the plan all along. And that's fine. I can live with that because I'm really not that into the App. It's just another way to pay for my Starbucks. But, what if the app is really good. So, the next question is what's the most appropriate response to a question. A simple yes or no, or maybe just a simple response. ""Sure, no problem."" ""Yeah, not a problem,"" might just about work, unless the questioner really does have some kind of emotional problem, then I go into a real world view. In that case, this is a very bad time to answer. The best response that I ever had to any question or problem from any other Human being was. You're gonna have have me? I didn't say that. Do I understand. Which means, Yes, because if I understood I wouldn't ask. Because I knew what that response meant. Now it's time for the, ""What the hell were you thinking?"", ""Why didn you say..."", and the whole thing. Not the best approach at all. At least it worked in my case. Well, at least in the cases, when it was just one thing that wasn't working for me. Like it works for you. Or not. If I had a choice, it'd be a lot nicer to just say something that worked. No matter what the problem is. Instead of all the stuff that goes with it. Why can't it be like a car. When you have any problem with your car, you take it in; you get an oil change, a new tire, something wrong? The dealer takes care of it, for one, two, three thousand bucks. Simple. That's what it should be. Just like we should always take our cars to the dealer to fix it when we have problems with them. As long as it is fixable."

281,I Would Like To Make A Transfer. How Much Does It Cost?,Considering this utterance: I Would Like To Make A Transfer. How Much Does It Cost? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? For example, to transfer, transfer money, buy and sale, change and exchange, purchase and pay for, or a different meaning?

1. The question is, “How much does transfer mean?” The following are the meanings of transfer as found in the Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia: transfer:
[1] a : to carry from one place to another b : a change of place by a natural process c : an act of carrying from a place or situation to a new place, situation, position, person, etc.
This dictionary definition of ‘transfer’ is what we might use as our ‌guideline or model to help us decide what ”to transfer“ means: to change position in a way that changes the original, from its original position (i.e., place of origin) to its new ‏position (or new position), or from the position it is currently in (its current place/situation) ‐to a position that has never been occupied. Transfer can also be used as the „moving‟ part, which is ‍‌a movement of an object from where it originally was to where another object is. For instance, if you transfer a chair from your desk to the floor, the chair has changed place ‒it has moved ‚„from here to there‘. In ’transferring‚ the object remains the same in both its current ‑place (on the table) and its ‛‍new place (the floor). Another example is changing the oil in your vehicle ‧‖you ‹change› the engine oil, so you have changed the place( /position‹ or ‭its new‬ position) of the current original substance(oil that you are changing) by replacing it ′from the old place /‭to‏ the new (new place)‛
Transfer can be defined as ″the act or process of changing‴ a condition of a substance, state, object, process, movement, condition, quality, place etc ‬‪(as by changing its place) from what it was ‮before (previous ‫position)to what/where it‡s"
282,"I Need To Make A Transfer, What Will The Fee Be?","Considering this utterance: I Need To Make A Transfer, What Will The Fee Be? What is the intent that best describes it?","?

(A) What will the fee be?; How much will this transfer to the bank cost? This may not be very specific; the person needs to know the cost.
The person who is transferring the money is not very interested in the details of the transaction. The fee is too expensive. It's an expensive transaction, and you're going to pay me back? That's a lot of money. I need to make this payment on time or you can charge an extra payment. You're paying me for my work? Yes, that's correct. That would be an example of an ambiguous intent. 
In the first example, the transfer is taking place. In the second example the payment has already occurred and is asking the recipient what he will receive for the service."
283,If I Make A Top-Up Are There Charges Applied?,Considering this utterance: If I Make A Top-Up Are There Charges Applied? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? 
I'm thinking it's ""I can't pay but I'd like to make a refund and you can keep any money that has been added to my account to pay for any fees that are incurred"" but that feels like a strange phrase.   The other thought I came up with was ""You should be happy that I can pay, but you should also be aware that some people don't have this ability.""
Is there a better way to word this?

A:
The way you have it currently is correct, as in ""refund"" the ""fee"" is added, ""with the fee"" being added at the end.
It is common for financial institutions to charge a fee when you make an account balance transfer, or when someone makes a top-up, and in your case it seems that they have waived the fees."

If you want to know about what the phrase means in the sentence you need to get a bit more specific with your question.  
You asked:  I'd like to... What does ""I'd Like.."" mean in:
I would like..
My guess?  You meant: ""Would"" not ""Like"".  There are a ton of ""would like"" sentences around.
The one I would use that you posted in your post was: Would You Like A Snack? - that would not be too far out of the ""main current"" of your sentence, it would be one that is close enough to be considered as ""one of several"" that mean the same thing and are more likely to fit."
287,Do I Have To Pay For Topping Up By Transfer?,Considering this utterance: Do I Have To Pay For Topping Up By Transfer? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?  

A:
The sentence: ""Do I have to pay to top up my phone?""  is perfectly understandable, and not necessarily ambiguous. It is asking the question - do I 'have to' pay (i.e. is it compulsory that I do so) or 'do I' actually have 'to' (in other words, can I or won't I).  It does not require any further explanation.  ""Topping up"" a mobile phone can be done using one of three ways: 'top-up', 'pre-paid' or through an 'over-the-air-update'.  In the first case, you would use the phone network and pay a specific amount of money, in the second case you have an amount pre-set by your phone company and the third case is when your telephone network provides a'service' and can update the content in your mobile handset without you paying any money."

It's just a way to get somebody to introduce him/herself - and you can't expect the stranger to ask you that right in the first few minutes of conversation.
That's what the ""any sort of fees"" part is saying.  That's it's not a formal way of saying this to you."
289,Is It Possible To Get A Transfer From Swift?,Considering this utterance: Is It Possible To Get A Transfer From Swift? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? The speaker is attempting to say ""Is it possible to get a transfer from swift?"" by uttering ""Swift"". The following example shows how utterances are written.

Swifter than the swindlers' deceit; swifter to the truth, the Word of Truth. It tramples on all who oppose. Is it not like a sharp sword, this Word? It penetrates right through, dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; and in its path not even death can exist, or aught of destruction. For destruction, death, and misery have no place in it. - John 1:1, 2, 3
The intent of John's utterable, expressed in English, would have been as follows: ""The Word is more sharp than a sword; it trample over all opposition. If the Bible is not true, it is like death and destruction; in other words, there are no survivors, only death."" In Greek, John wrote it as 'Logos' which can be translated as Word. The meaning, intent, context, etc. remains the same but this is a change of word to help students who need to understand the meaning of the sentence. This can help the student when reading the verse. Asking the question ""Can I get the translation of this into my language."" will help to determine if the text is helpful to a particular student group."
290,Do I Have To Pay Any Fees In Order To Receive Money?,Considering this utterance: Do I Have To Pay Any Fees In Order To Receive Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
The best fit would be to say, ""I need your help"".  This would mean that you need their assistance in some way.
It is very hard to define intent.  In this case, you are asking a very specific question. Asking ""do I have to pay any fees in order to receive money"" is too broad, and you get no information. It would not be reasonable for a bank teller to ask: ""Do I need some ID before I can receive $100 or $1000?"", or ""What exactly are you willing to give me as collateral?""
For instance, if you wanted to know what a check for $1500 would take as an endorsement, your question is not ""what do I do to be able to endorse a $15,000 check"", but rather ""which bank will take the $3000 as sufficient collateral for the check?""  If you asked the first question, the bank has no way of determining the answer."
291,How Much Am I Charged To Receive Money?,Considering this utterance: How Much Am I Charged To Receive Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The best answer for this question can be found in a famous story of the Bible, in which a man named Lazarus, who was sick, asked a rich man to help his relatives from the poor people of this world (Luke 16:18-19). But before the rich can help them, he was asked to show that he is able to pay back. In exchange for the gift he would receive, his rich neighbor demanded his money. The poor man, unable to produce any money, was rejected. And when it comes to the phrase What are they charging me to receive money in this life? the most logical and best interpretation is that of a challenge: Can I prove that I can give my money or that, at least, it is very easy for me? This is not only because of how much money can you have in the world today! But that's not the point. Lazarus's rich and powerful neighbors were demanding that the sick poor would prove his worthiness to have the help they were willing to give. They were challenging Lazarus to demonstrate the fact of who he really is in terms of money (wealthy or poor).
I would love to see other interpretations. Please, I beg you!
By the way, the whole passage of Luke 16 (in the New American Bible) is interesting and very helpful for us because it helps us to understand the meaning of life.
Thanks. (I think that this is just a matter that you might need to discuss with your pastor.)

Juan
P.S. I would like to say that we are all sinners. Some of us are richer and some of poorer. That's what makes us different. As a Christian, when you do not like people, you are actually rejecting them. This does not mean that it's the worst thing to be rich. It just means that when people judge you you will judge them in return. We all deserve God's mercy."
292,Will You Deal With Swift Transfers?,Considering this utterance: Will You Deal With Swift Transfers? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Is there a meaning conveyed by the use of a definite or an indefinite article: “Will You..” or ”Will someone.?""?
  
The following may all be true:

""Will you do this for me? ""
 ""Will she?""
 'Will he?'
 ‘I'll try to do that’
‘What will you say about that?“
'I will deal with that for you'
If you are asking a question, the correct answer to the question in the above examples is ’yes'.  The first example is a direct request for your assistance.  In the second two instances the verb „will‟ is used in conjunction with the subject (she, he) to indicate the speaker's intention. This is not the case in ""I„ will"".  If you were to add an auxiliary verb, ‹will you›, then you would have indicated a condition.
It is important to be aware that ‚will. ‟ and ›will have. "" and will be‹ are two different words. The main difference lies between the two verb forms ‴will do. (involving present participle)‴  and  ″will hav e. ""(in the past tense). The meaning of the former differs from the latter. A will have is one who will do, and is an indication of future. However, a will is always indicative of condition (condition being what has to have taken place before the action is considered complete) or result (result being the end result or final conclusion of action).  One cannot do without the other. It is very difficult to distinguish between what will hae and what wil.
In the third example, it is possible that the sentence may have a slightly different meaning, but it depends on context. †The third sentence is slightly unusual, in that it does not have an ‬object‬‚ it may be understood as: 'You can be honest with your friends'. It might also be: ""Do not worry about this. I'll deal w it for y ou.""
Note: The word ′deal‡  has a different use and meaning to ‭deal with‭ and to deal†.†  It"
293,Will There Be Any Charges For Money Received?,Considering this utterance: Will There Be Any Charges For Money Received? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
Bold face: In a sentence with an initial verb, the initial word usually gives the impression that what follows is a complete sentence, usually a question. 
In this sentence the bold face verb is ""Will there be any charges (for)"" with no question mark.
The initial bold word could be a noun or verb. Here it could either be ""there will be no charges"" or ""will be there any charge"". In the first case it is clear that you are expecting a simple declarative statement with the answer being either no or yes. In both cases ""no"" is assumed. (As opposed to the second example where the verb in the final sentence makes no sense without specifying there will definitely be charges.) You can also say ""would there have been no charge"" if you're not sure whether it was paid or not. Note that it makes absolutely no difference to this construction whether the word following it starts with a letter or a word. You don't even have to use an article when making a statement."
294,Will A Transfer Incur A Fee?,Considering this utterance: Will A Transfer Incur A Fee? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

To answer, we could use the dictionary, but that wouldn’t be very fun, would it? Let‘s have a go at figuring it out with a little more of a brain-stretching approach. First, let“s look up the first word and the second word; “to transfer” and ”fee.„ If we take the meanings of the two individual words and look at what they have in common, it will give us a good starting point. Let us start by looking up „to‟ in our dictionary.
The first thing we can say for sure is that it describes a process. ‟Transfer‌ refers to a change of place or action and not a person or object or anything that is already in a definite place. It also describes an action that has a goal to achieve. We might say ‚to take‚ a transfer is usually a way of getting where we are going from here to elsewhere, for example ‘to go from Point A to Point B‛. Now we must look back to the definition of †›fee‏ and take note of an important word, ″incur″. The definition is a synonym for ’cause‮ and we might use it to talk about what happens when we buy something, as in‬‹ ‗‡I will incur a ‹price‭ ‖ when I pay for the item. When you buy a new car or furniture, you often must pay a fee or charge for it. This is because of insurance and other considerations such as registration, maintenance and so on. In this case, however, there is no insurance involved. You have paid your money already and it is your decision to incur the fee. There is‰nothing  that has to be done. Once you have made your mind up to go ahead, the‫transfer of․ money between your‪‍bank • account‥and the bank‧‒ ‪s of… the foreign―country‣ begins. So, when you transfer your ‫money,‱‐​you incur ‬"

The speaker is trying to indicate that the subject's feelings or emotions towards his former wife are so strong that if he were given the chance he could do nothing other than make love to her.
Is this correct?  
I would expect that in order to answer these questions, we need to go through the meaning of each word as well as each phrase.  And in addition to this, the context needs to be considered. I've been told this is a ""basic question"" in ""grammar"" or ""English Language Usage"" that has been used ""for years"" but there is nothing in my books or the Internet that I can find. Can you please point me to these materials? I am an avid reader. It would be great if you could point to the books themselves. Thank you. (I apologize for the length of this question...but I thought it may be a good illustration of where ""a sentence"" ends and where a word starts or vice-versa.)
Here is another example of an utterances that could use the same help:
A: You have to take her with you!
B: I love her, and she loves me. That makes it all OK. We can't live without each other. Take her? Sure! (In this case I don't think the ""with you"" means the two of them are going as lovers or something that they will do together. But if that makes sense as one meaning, then it could possibly fit the other meaning as mentioned by another poster above).  Can we tell which is more likely?

296,If I Transfer Money From My Bank To Top-Up My Account Will I Be Charged?,Considering this utterance: If I Transfer Money From My Bank To Top-Up My Account Will I Be Charged? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

In this phrase, the speaker is asking for his or her bank account balance be transferred from one account to another. In other words, he or she wants his/her account funds be spent on.
– The first word used by the author: transfer (a word that implies that the funds are going from a place or source to a different place, or from an account holder to one that is not his own, such as the case of the bank.)
— The second word: from (it shows that funds from bank of source (the bank) are being transferred into his account.) and balance (as in, I have money in my bank that can be used to pay the bills and other expenses that may be incurred, and it is called my “balance.” The balance is how much the holder of a banking account has in his funds.)"
297,Will I Be Charged If Someone Needs To Send Me Money?,Considering this utterance: Will I Be Charged If Someone Needs To Send Me Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I believe that the above utterances are more like to be interpreted as: I will be charged if someone needs to send me money. And as you can see, the word ‘someone’ has been implied.
This sentence:
“He is going to charge me for the cost of his trip to London.”
The word for him is implied in the sentence, “will‘,‬ ‬is‰ ”, and it is a direct object.  The question is: is that correct? I would have said that we have more than one sentence. The second question: what is this ’He/Someone› doing ?'‚'He‡ is/are going, to‭ '

298,What Are The Fees For Top-Ups?,Considering this utterance: What Are The Fees For Top-Ups? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

In a single word phrase I would say ""The Fees"". If it is a two word sentence I might say: ""Fees"".
But I'm struggling to say why these two different answers are correct.
Why do they both give the correct answer? Are they simply interchangeable to express the same thing? Why should one option be ""better"" or more commonly used than the other? If I use ""the fees"" why should I think about that I have to use 'the' before fees? In which case I need to put fees in quotes. 
I just can't understand it at all!
Can people explain why they have the right answer - and maybe why it's better to do one than other way?   Thank you!  :)
Here are some examples:
Example 1: If you are thinking about it as ""How much are the fees?"", then ""fees"" is correct;
The fees are $5 per minute. (Fee means charge a fee)
If you're thinking of it ""What are these fees?"" then 'fares' is more common because you don't need the apostrophe. ""This is how much the fare is."" (the fare refers to how a taxi is paid, not the price)  However using fees without an apostrophes is perfectly fine. This is an example of a situation were fees can be used without the 'a'.
http://www.dictionaryofsyntax.com/Fare.html  ""He said 'no' to the fee, so I had to pay a lot.""
Fares are a type of transport, and so ""transport cost"" can also be a good alternative. https://discover.translate.google.co.uk/transliteration?from=en&to=au&hl=aus&sa=N&dct=langs&tbb=1&output=plain&uilang=AUS  https;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxi_fare

300,What Are The Charges For Receiving Money?,Considering this utterance: What Are The Charges For Receiving Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I am a firm believer that this sort of question can be easily answered by going to a dictionary, and reading the answer. It is not a complicated question.
So here are the correct definitions from Merriam-Webster.com :
1 : to give or accept or ask (a bribe) 
2 : (1)to receive money or other valuable consideration (as for service) ; (2) to receive (money) by paying for something <to get the benefit of his money by a gift>. 3 :to accept money <pay my bills>"
301,What Is The Fee To Receive Money?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Fee To Receive Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
There has been a lot of confusion about this question.  I think the confusion comes about from the fact that the English language is not well equipped to communicate the concepts in question because we have to use a variety of metaphors and analogies to do so.
In other languages, such as Latin, we express these ideas very directly. In Latin there are several terms used to convey one of two concepts. (1) Obligation is a term which is very literal and which describes the concept of something owed to you. It means that something is required of you and you cannot escape from it without paying a penalty (or penalty).
(2) Debtor is more figurative and has two meanings. One is that of a servant who is indebted to his master and is obligated to provide service or labor to satisfy the duty to one's master. The other is of someone who owes a debt and who does not satisfy that debt without being penalized (i.e., ""a debtor cannot pay without penalty"").
To answer your question, when it comes to something that is paid to someone else by a bank to obtain currency it is an act of obligation on that bank; therefore, there is no ""debt"" involved. When you make a deposit with a person or entity, you are in the position of the debtor, and when you receive currency that was paid for from another entity the one who paid it you was obligated (and therefore obliged, indebted) because you failed to fulfill that obligation of payment which means you must return what is yours or you will pay a price. I am not suggesting that you or your money is someone's possession. But it was your obligation and thus you were required to return it when they asked you for it."
302,How Much Am I Charged For A Sepa Transfer?,Considering this utterance: How Much Am I Charged For A Sepa Transfer? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

1.
Inform about the amount of money one gets as an amount for transferring their money or the number of times one is charged for the same. (for example the bank transfer fees).
The other one would be
2. Inform that one has to pay money for a Sepah transfer. 
3.Informat the cost of a single transfer
4.I think it is more than what you will be charged
5.What is my Sepaj
6.My bank charges too much
7.It can be very costly to use a bank for such a service
8.Sepa transfer means to move money from one account to another. it can also mean sending money. for example a person would give you the money and you send them the rest. in that process of transferring money, one could charge you a fee. which is a transfer that is made to send money to someone."
303,How Much Is The Fee For A Sepa Transfer?,Considering this utterance: How Much Is The Fee For A Sepa Transfer? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

Fee is an adverb in this case, not an adjective. You can't use the comparative phrase ""How much is more than the fee..."".
If the answer was ""a fee"", it means something like ""The charge is a fee"".
That is, the word ""fee"" is not the subject of the sentence, it is only a way of expressing what the price is and there are different words to express that. 
In some other languages, ""transfere"" means ""to transfer"" and in French we use ""donner"" to mean that too. In those languages they use a verb in the accusative and ""the transferer"" can be understood as an object of that verb. So that would be the way to make ""Is the charge more? I want to transfer my money""."
304,What'Ll It Charge Me For A Sepa Transfer?,Considering this utterance: What'Ll It Charge Me For A Sepa Transfer? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I'm thinking here that the phrase is ""What's it gonna cost me for a Separation Transfer?"" but as the title of this question states, I may be wrong.
Edit
This isn't a duplicate. The two questions are subtly different. My question refers specifically to the meaning of the expression as part of a sentence, while the other question is general and asks for all of them. I also didn't know this was even a partioned question, because I don't really read the FAQ before asking questions, unless I have a specific answer that I need to ask for. And I definitely didn'T have that answer. 
The other one has a couple answers already, but none of those answers really address my question. (I know it's a very vague question)
Here's the answer I got after my first answer was accepted:
https://dictionary.cambridge.org/questions/british-grammar/what-s-it-going-to-cost-me-for-a-separation-transfer?q=separate#answer-262696
But this answer doesn't address the sentence I wrote in the question title and it doesn' address whether this is just as valid as using ""is"" and what would be more natural. That answer also says that you should use ""Is"" with ""Separation"", but it does not specifically discuss what I asked in my title or what is natural in that sentence. In fact, that particular question has an accepted answer, so I'd have expected the one I posted to be accepted had it been asked before that question and not this one. Or at least there would have been an explanation of what the difference between ""it'll be a separate charge"" vs. ""It's going to cost him $100, you know"" is. It doesn'.
So if anyone wants to clarify the answers to my own question with further explanation, feel free to answer it, since I'm not sure that my explanation was clear enough. But I did get a comment telling me to check that this wasn't considered a dupe, and that's where I am now. So I think I just need more explicit directions as to what my issue is here. Thanks. :)

It's a word you might use when you're trying to express a certain meaning and you don’t want to use the verb of the sentence and instead you use a noun which means ‘charge‘, like you are charging the speaker/writer/speaker writer of writing this paragraph a charge to write one.
In my opinion if you really are trying a different meaning than charging or being charged it could be a lot better to go with a phrasal verb that is better for that meaning. A lot of times this can be expressed by adding the “to/for doing something/to do something” to a verb. The phrase ” is there a fee to top up by transfer?“ might be an example. This is not the only example but it is a common one:
„ I am doing some work and I need you to give me a list of all the people you want me to call to get work done by me‟
vs
If you‪ 'to top-up by‬ transfer'‚is this a correct use of words?
1. topup - top
2. up - up

I have been doing this all week and it seems slow to me.
My best friend just said, “You’re doing a transfer. I did a quick transfer in my program today.“
Does ""doing a swift transfer"" work? Or is it better to say, ""You're doing transfers""? I know there are many other variations. So I need to be careful with my wording. Thanks!
Thanks for any help. This is so easy for me to do. The other day I was using my credit card, my brother asked me, if I wanted to get an eCheck. He said he was going to go down to the bank and do a echeck on mine. It was easy when he did it. We both did one. Mine was free. And I just got paid today too.

307,Should I Expect To Be Charged For Topping Up By Transfer?,Considering this utterance: Should I Expect To Be Charged For Topping Up By Transfer? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Is it intended to be humorous or sarcastic? If it is satirical, is there any hidden meaning?

This is a quote from the following passage:
""A recent article in the New York Observer by the well known columnist, Maureen Dowd, (who wrote in her column on June 9, 2007), quoted a senior Obama administration official as saying, ""We will charge you for the top-up.""
I suspect that there is some hidden sarcasm here and it's intended as humorous because ""a lot of us"" are in a position to ""charge you (in my case) for that top up"" because we've received it for free over the years.
The first part of this question is: ""The answer is yes, in fact we are charging you"", while the second part is, for most students, it would be: No because they've actually received the service free of charge.  
To me, the answer to the first question has to do with ""charging you"" meaning ""requiring you to make payments"".  To me it seems like this is an obvious answer, so it might be difficult to find out if ""yes, you will pay"" fits that definition (as long as there are no further clarifying details given).

309,Is There A Fee For A Transfer? If So How Much Will It Be?,Considering this utterance: Is There A Fee For A Transfer? If So How Much Will It Be? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? In order to answer the above questions, we shall take a look at some examples using the word fee. The following are several ways to express the concept of a fee using a single word as we move from examples of fee, fee in the present day, the term fee for a transfer to using fee to mean payment.

In general, you get what you pay for, a simple statement that holds true no matter what type of service you may need or want, and this is also true when using services offered by financial services institutions like banks. However, there are exceptions to this rule especially when referring to the fees and commissions that certain financial product or services providers charge. So, if you want to find the best rates and the most competitive services, be sure you find and know the fee structure that you are subjecting yourself to because what looks like a bargain in your favor may turn out to be expensive if the hidden fees are taken into consideration. Here are some general tips that can help guide you so that the cost of your transaction is minimized and you can get the results that are important to you. For a full breakdown on fees that appear throughout a financial transaction be referred to your financial institution’s statement which can also be found online or when you receive your monthly statements. A great way to make sure that your fees do not add up to a hefty amount is to shop around. Most financial institutions offer similar services but there might be a small fee or discount which should at least cover the service that they provide to assist you in making the correct decision. If you feel that an offer is too good to pass on, don‟t be afraid to ask questions. It is always better to know what is being charged before you commit to something that makes you nervous or that doesn‘t feel like it is right for you financially or in some other way. One of the biggest mistakes that most people make when purchasing financial products and services is by not fully understanding their cost and how they will be charged. This mistake is often the one that causes more trouble. Financial advisers can be helpful in this regard. They are usually able to explain how the product, service or transaction will work so you have a good understanding and can determine if it makes sense for your situation or not."

Intent
The first thing you need to consider as an eLearning designer is intent.
What is
the intent
of the message in the statement? How is that being achieved through the use of language in this particular text? There are several possibilities to look at. The first of which is to simply look
at the text. Does it express what the writer wants to say? This is usually the easiest method. It can, however, be difficult to determine what they really mean. When that
occurs, there is a different method to follow, and that is: what is most important to the content creator? What does
they
need to get across to their target audience? They will most likely have already developed a hypothesis before
beginning to work
on a particular piece of e-learning to confirm the theory. They are probably using a combination of a number of research tools and methods to
reach their
conclusion in order to support their hypothesis. Whatever the case may be, this should be considered when looking at any text that needs to be developed for use in eTraining. A second question to ask in conjunction with intent, is whether it is necessary to develop that particular message or whether a message that can be delivered through a non-specific language can have a similar effect to a well delivered, specific message. In some cases, it may not be necessary. There may, for instance, a specific target population that a training needs but it should only target and not alienate. If that’s the
case you should consider the impact that the wording will have. You have to know the audience. This can only be done through some degree of
research, which will enable the design team to make informed decisions. However, the final decision to go with a
specific or a more
broad message, should not
be taken without the support of the end users. As mentioned below, an important part of creating
a quality piece
is to involve users in
development. User Involvement
As a designer, you may have read about how important user involvement is in training development, but this is true. More specifically, user
involvements
can take on
one of three aspects, depending on the stage of development. One of these is ‘end
user
testing”. End user testing"

313,Is A Swift Transfer Okay?,Considering this utterance: Is A Swift Transfer Okay? What is the intent that best describes it?,". For example, we could take “What should a man do after his wife leaves him for another man?”

If there are two or more words, use a comma when the two verbs are in the same clause. If there is one verb, then use the following rule.
1. Use a preposition when it serves to indicate place or direction: I live in a village, I am going to school, My father is in prison, We shall be happy when summer comes. But do this not for emphasis. You could not use ‘We’ in this way. Instead, ”We shall“. The word ’shall‘ makes the statement more formal and more serious. 2. In a series or a group, do not put a conjunction after the noun, but after each verb in that group or after a verb at the end of the group. Do not write two of these. I love cats, and dogs. 3. When two sentences are joined by a coordinating conjunctio, the conjunctive adverbial ‛the‛ is generally omitted. This is especially true when these sentences appear in different syntactic positions in close proximity to one another. These are: ※› I went to the store and bought some groceries. (The verb ‹„ to buy‹ is followed by the infinitive ′‚ to go′, which is not the case with the verb of motion. ‡ I go to my sister‟s home to visit her. 4. There are no exceptions to this rule where the second clause begins with a noun that is modified by ″the.‶ This sentence is therefore incorrect: We are going home, to our home. 5.

314,Will I Be Charged A Fee If I Receive A Sepa Transfer,Considering this utterance: Will I Be Charged A Fee If I Receive A Sepa Transfer What is the intent that best describes it?,"? The verb will is usually not used in this way.

A:
[...] a verb such as [will] can be an adverbial modifier, for which a comma is appropriate. 
In contrast, will (as a standalone word) generally means “future tense” or ” future action“: 

 – I’m going to do it; 
  – Will you give me the job interview ? [=‘If I … , I will give it you‽]
 –  This will hurt a lot; (=„I expect that it will [do]‚ [hurt] a
a lot‹)
–  It won‟t [be] easy to persuade him; [… =› I expect it (that) to be
difficult to get him to agree (= to change his mind)]
-  I won't be able to come [to] see him next week; (= I
believe that I cannot be there (on the day of the appointment))
The difference between [future] and [past] will in English is
often unclear: it depends on the context. For example, the present
participle can have a past meaning in   ‚-ing constructions,
e.g. He - /s/‛/t is a great man.‮ (‒He
is/was a good/great man)‰
I don‧t think you can say that will  = „future‌‪-is‬‡‭. Rather
you would probably have to say: ‹‫I think that he‷s‏/he is going
to‥/ ‫he will come. ‬(But if I say ’I
think he will/ he is going [ … = … ]‿, you are  talking about
how I judge his state of mind, not his future actions. [I might
also use ′I  believe he ‡will/ will come (if I think he

315,"When Topping Up By Transfer, Will I Be Charged?","Considering this utterance: When Topping Up By Transfer, Will I Be Charged? What is the intent that best describes it?","? And which of the three words would be used and when it would best be placed to convey that intent?

In this chapter we will look at phrasal verbs and how and whether we use them in speech and what effect they have on the listener. It turns out there are many types of phrased verbs, some of which are more commonly used than others; some have more than one meaning; and some are used to a great extent.
**Types of Phrasal Verbs**
Phrasals are verbs used as units. They are a type of compound verb, a class of verb that includes nouns and noun phrases. When a verb is used in this way, it becomes a phrasion. We will find that we have different types, or categories of, phrasing. These are:
• simple phrash
– phrases with one verb
Examples: I'm gonna be late, I am so busy, There are people in there. (The verb ""to be"" is a simple one, with an object, ""late"", meaning ""time"")
When a word is phraded, the form of it changes; usually it loses its ending and takes on extra meanings: it may not even be present at all, if that makes sense? There will be more about this in a later chapter. For now, this type are simple, one sentence or one idea, phrases, used with no specific verbs in them. There is no other verb than the one you use, like in the following example: A) I saw an elephant in Africa, B) It was a big old thing I did not want to meet. In the two examples above, there might be other words in between but not much. The main verb in each example is I-saw. You could say something similar in real life like: He saw a black cat in his garden, he has been having some problems with the cat. Again, in both examples, only the verb saw is being used even if we could see more. A phrasy doesn't change a noun into the phradee, but it does give the noun extra meaning by attaching extra words to it. Example: If you say ""I'll be there"", you mean you are going to do it, you're committed to doing it or you will do, even though, technically"
316,What Us The Fee To Transfer Money From My Bank?,Considering this utterance: What Us The Fee To Transfer Money From My Bank? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? If your intent is to ask, where can I get some money, then you’re asking for a transfer. If you want to get a sense of what money can do, you can say, what can money do for me (or me do with money). If we change the subject of the conversation a little we can also say what you get for money.

What does this mean exactly?
It means that all these things can be bought with the currency of money or a thing known as cash. When you use cash, money transfers to you directly. On the other hand, when you receive cash from someone, they transfer money to them. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to say: A person gives me cash to buy a car, it would make more sense if you said a person transfers a sum of cash into my hand. This is why you say ‚É€the fee to transfer the money from my account to my bank?‛ or you could say I have no money in my current account right now (meaning you do not have money for yourself at the moment) or in the bank account. (This means you have a balance with your bank. Money that someone else has deposited into your account and you cannot access it).
There is one more way in which you might refer to money: If it is important that you know that money has been or is available in an account, and if someone doesn't want you to know, say they've withdrawn the funds, meaning they took the cash away from the account or it has vanished. They might not want other people to find out about it for any number of reasons. You can ask if they withdrew the fees. Or if the person has withdrawn it, why he has done that. In this sentence we are using the word withdrawn to mean, I took it out of your hand/bank account/my hand etc. We are not using it in its meaning of being taken to another place/in transit/or to be delivered, or taken away to somewhere else in particular, but rather to take out. That is, to put it away, for personal use. For instance, we might say a friend has given you some cash; that would mean he had money left in his current accounts. He might have decided to use his personal money (cash) to"

What is it about the phrase that makes you feel that it is not a typical sentence with any semantic content? Can you provide an example of how the content changes as you add a different word to this sentence? What if the next word changed to ""however"" instead, could you then explain the difference in meaning? Or does the grammatical difference between ""what"" and ""that"" create a sentence that seems to carry different meanings depending upon context? Try it out for the sentence What Is The Cost.

319,Please Help Me!  I Need To Cancel A Transaction.,Considering this utterance: Please Help Me!  I Need To Cancel A Transaction. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?  

A:
The sentence is not ambiguous. In general, please help (help me) means ""Do you help me?"". Please help is more often used in an imperative sense as in please make sure you do your homework or I will kill you. But in this sentence, it seems that the speaker does not want to get help from the recipient to cancel the transaction.
I would suggest using ""Can you"" or the equivalent in the target language."
320,Can You Limit My Top Up?,Considering this utterance: Can You Limit My Top Up? What is the intent that best describes it?,"only?

A:
The phrase 'can you limit my top up' has two meanings.
First sense: 'Can you help me with top ups?'  
Second sense, if context supports it:  'Will you charge me for the top-ups as part of my mobile contract?'
If you were to use either of these without the others, people might interpret that as 'help top me up', 'charge me to top off' or similar.  These might not sound quite the same."
321,Am I Free To Top-Up As Much As I Want?,Considering this utterance: Am I Free To Top-Up As Much As I Want? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? 

A:
It is an utterances of the following form:  ""Am I free to X (the thing that is not stated)?""
This kind of uttering is usually used when it is something that the listener may do and you don't want him to know what it actually is.  An example would be  when you ask your friend if he is free and he will say ""yes"", but you actually want to ask him if you can borrow his lighter.
There are many different ways to express this: a common one, though, will be
""Can I have permission to [do X]?"""
322,Is There A Top Up Limit For My Account?,Considering this utterance: Is There A Top Up Limit For My Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

In this case, an expression that indicates:
A person has received an amount of money from his account, and is wondering if it is enough to pay for his needs. In other words, he is concerned about the balance in his bank account
Another interpretation would be: ""Is there enough money in my account to cover the expenses I have scheduled for this week?""
Still another interpretation of the expression would mean, ""Has there been an excess balance remaining in this account for the past month?"" 
My question is, is there more than one interpretation? If so, how is it determined what is intended here? Is there any way one can distinguish between the different interpretations? Or is this a trick question designed only to throw the student off?"
323,What Is The Limit To Top Up?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Limit To Top Up? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? I think the following are the most common interpretations; however, I’m curious to hear the different interpretations from those who think of them this way.

If you don‘t have this particular phrase in your vocabulary then it might help to understand the context. For example, if the speaker is saying he only has $100 to spend then how does the phrase work? This isn”t the case with everyone. You can have money in more than one account. Therefore I believe this phrase should not be used in this sense. If you use top-up for the first phrase listed above, then you can say that someone is giving more funds to me than I have, or is using more of my money than is in my account, etc. The phrase has a much different meaning here. So, the next time you get this question, you know the answer. Or you“ll have to wait for a future question or answer that might answer this one. I hope that helps!
Best,

If, for some reason, I cannot figure out the best-fit intent, but am unsure of the intended use of this sentence, is there a good alternative phrase I can use in place of ""How Much"", such as ""In what amount"", ""With that much"", etc.?

A:
""How much money can I top up?"" is a question and ""in that amount"" or ""with that"" might be the answers.

325,What Are The Restrictions To Top-Offs?,Considering this utterance: What Are The Restrictions To Top-Offs? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

Intention:
In this example, intent is to emphasize that a restriction is being used by someone that is of greater privilege than another, so the speaker has less right to do something than they normally would (in this particular context, to drink a beer at a party), and the restriction can be used to prevent something they would otherwise do.
I do not really understand what the last line is asking or implying, and what words would you use to rephrase it? The words I used here are: 
""The restrictions that apply to top-offs""   -- what is this trying to ask or imply?  It's not asking if you can go from a ""full"" to a half-beer to an ""extra"" one, because we already established that was the original intent.  I guess, if I were asking what restriction applies to ""top-ups"", that would make sense, but what are the actual restrictions on top ups? (the ""what"" is implied in the context of the example.)
The way I am viewing the sentence, it seems like it is trying, as best I can tell, for me to explain what a top up is -- I'm going to assume that the reader has no context that they need to understand in order to figure the answer out. But if that's the case, would it be better to say something along these lines? ""What are all (or the main) restrictions to the use of top offs?""  The answer, I believe, is, there are no restrictions and there's nothing that says you cannot or must not use a Top Off, even at some point that someone else would not ordinarily be able to use, e.g., at the end of a night out after the bars have closed etc. The intent was simply to illustrate what it means to be a restricted drinker, in general -- not in any specific context. (In that particular example it was to give the impression of privilege.)  Is this a good usage of Restriction? What are restrictions in English? I have no idea. I found one that seemed somewhat similar on ELL, which was: When a man buys a woman a drink it’s called a “top off.” What this sentence really means is: when a person buys one‘s spouse a present"

Note:  I have not checked to ensure the use of any of the following: 'top-up' or 'up-top.'

What does it mean when you say, ""I need to know"" for top ups of the same?

A:
[The phrase ""top ups"" can have many meanings and the phrase, and context, may not make it clear that it is a specific meaning.]
I'm not sure this is helpful, but you said you are from Africa and in that culture there may be a way to communicate what you mean without saying it. This is one such way: You can say ""How is your health/life/work?"" and people will immediately know what to do without being asked. There are a variety of ways that this works: They may ask ""how is you?"", they may give information, they just answer. (Some cultures don't actually ask at all.) 
As a native English speaker, it can be hard to see how to ask for help on something we have trouble with (or something that is not in our culture). However you seem to be getting by, perhaps you can do what I did, that was the best way I could think of: Read, watch, ask questions, talk to people. I would suggest that you do not get too hung up on ""what does this mean"" and just be patient and find your way."

330,What Is Maximum Top Up?,Considering this utterance: What Is Maximum Top Up? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

In other words, is it a single word, a sentence, an idiom, or an expression? In addition, it is in the present tense, so you are using the verb ‘to be’ in this phrase to imply that the top-up is always the maximum and never less than the full amount.
It is a good question and I will attempt to explore these issues as clearly as possible. The following words may be of help in helping you with a better understanding of this question:
Definition: to be; to exist or occur
Examples: I am tall, You are smart, We are happy, He is happy. We can add an adjective here like “tall”, ”smart“,‘happy„.We are always happy but are „happy as we can be.‟
Adjective: ’can be ‚
Noun:› ‑be ›
Dictionary definition: the state of being able
Conjugation: verb; ′to BE‒
Synonyms: Existing, Occurring, Exist, There to Be‰ (‹ to occur ‹)
Antonyms : ‰can not be, there isn t ‟, not (the) can (not) to †, can not ‡.etc. (The words in bold font is what we are talking about.)
This expression of max is also related to the adverbial, adjectival and nominal phrases ‛to say‛, that is, to express, state or to declare. So what it means is that we need to say that this thing must always be the most. This also means that max top up always has the ″maximum ‶, which would mean, in my opinion, the word maximum. And I think so because of: The word ‪maximum, according to wiktionary ‫is the highest or most extreme example of a category or a value. I hope you get the idea. Also, max means ‭to reach a maximum ‬. In the dictionary, I found: maximum = ‱most extreme case. It doesn‚t matter if you use ‏the word in a sense of  ‪‣ ‵‱or‬, like in:"

This is also about the meaning of:
I want to know the price of this
What is that price?  
My friend asked: How do you want that? What do I mean about what she meant was the question: If you are talking about a particular quantity that you can buy, is there a price you set or if you mean there can be no limit how much you may buy is 'there a no maximum i can top up?'
Can someone give me an example of how someone might ask 'what is it like to do this', or 'can i have more or less?' to help me think about this? Thank you.  This also pertains to the use of the word'more'. It is used both as 'it is like you have the more' for a positive sense, and 'you can have it more than this' as negative. I'm not trying to be funny here. Thank You.
The reason why I ask questions about it is because the words'max' and more are used in the same sentence. They are the opposites of each other, but if they are in one sentence they mean different things to me. It seems like there should be a word that describes a limit of a quantity, that is not the opposite of 'having more', because 'less' is just that, I think. This might be like how we say you should have a more 'positive' or positive feeling towards something, which is having a 'negative' feeling. Does this make sense? Any advice to think out of my head to come up with a real world example that shows how words are connected in this way to one another? I can't find examples in my own thoughts. Perhaps you might. If so could a native English speaker please help? And could you explain the grammar so I don't feel so stupid that day when I meet the person who will explain what I need to read. Thanks again. Again I am so happy to learn. :)

335,What Is The Limit To A Top-Up?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Limit To A Top-Up? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I think the correct meaning of the phrase ""what is limit to top-up"" is ""How much of an amount will be accepted when you use your money"". For example, there are various limits to how much money you may withdraw from a bank account, or how long you must wait before you make a withdrawal with a credit card etc. I think this is a fairly simple meaning to grasp for almost any english speaker.
But I have come up with two explanations on why people seem to have a hard time understanding the meaning. The first explanation is that this phrase can have more than one meaning, in which case the question is how to decide which definition should be used. But the second explanation of why is not understood as there is no meaning in it at all. This may be explained because this type of phrase is too subtle for an ordinary person and he cannot understand it as something of which there's no limit. For instance, when using the word limit, you can understand how someone may limit a limit and so on, but you cannot limit this kind of limitation. It just doesn't exist.  
So my question has two parts:
Why do many people say, ""I am unable to understand what is this sentence trying to say""?. Or, perhaps: Is there any explanation for the ambiguity in this expression? What if the expression is used in a sentence and does it mean this? For the sake of example: ""What is he unable not to find in the room?"". I am not interested in whether the usage is correct or not. My question concerns the explanation as why a person may say ""this sentence is ambiguous"" or ""there's nothing in there that can be limited"" etc
And a final question to which I believe has an answer to why this ""limit to the end-of-line"" phrase doesn not have any meaning as it should have: How do I know when it does not exist because ""the other limit is infinite"" in some cases, and why does this not make sense since this may also exist in other expressions? How does one know which limit of a group of limits applies?  Or perhaps, it makes no sense because the other group is also infinite? And why doesn’t this matter that I can use limit as an adjective to show the limit-ness of something? I don”"
336,Tell Me If There Are Any Top-Up Limits?,Considering this utterance: Tell Me If There Are Any Top-Up Limits? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

There is no clear winner in this case, as the question could be reworded so the sentence would be easier to understand. However, the original one has more context and is more difficult to paraphrase or rephrase, so it is also a better answer to the ""What do you mean"" question.
The correct answer would also be better in the context of the answer, but you could not ask for a context to help answer a question of what a single sentence means."
337,How Can I Top-Up My Limit?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Top-Up My Limit? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

To add to my account
For example, what if the person is talking about paying for an existing account? How could that be expressed in one- or a couple-word phrases? What other ways can one express the idea of ""add to"" that could be useful? (I'm not looking for ways to say ""I want to increase my limit."" I'm looking only for the ways of saying ""Increase my existing limit"".) (See also: Can you help me with my sentence?)
What is this called, exactly? Is there an entire genre of expression that's used for this sort of thing, or is it specific to banking? If there's an established idiom that means ""top up"" in this context, but I didn't know the technical term for that, how do I find its usage? I'd also like to know about other terms related to top-ups.
Is the above phrase idiomatic? Does it convey a certain nuance that others might find odd? 
Note: This is for English-language use. I don't want idioms from other languages (or non-English languages).
I know that this phrase has a meaning in banking, so that limits the scope of the question as I've expressed it above. If I could phrase this question differently, I would have. But I wanted to make sure this particular idom didn’t come up in the search, because in my context it‘s only applicable to a specific use in a very specific context. The same with “top-up.”
My intent with this is to come across as being educated and professional so I can appear to be a good potential employee. So, please answer only if you think your answer provides an insightful answer for my intent. My goal with the phrasing is also intended to convey ""professional"". In this, context is very, very critical. (This is not a shopping question or about an idio, which I also ask about in another question.)
Also, the idoms I›m looking to find are ’top“ and ”up„. ‘Top‟ is used in other contexts that might not work here, such as the following example:

A:

In some circumstances, I might use the shorter form for emphasis (for instance, when I'm trying to get a point across quickly) and the longer form when the context allows me to do so. 
For example: Let's go over this again. The answer is no, there is not a limit on top-ups."

As you will see, this is not about grammar. This is about meaning, in context, and about words – that is, words in their ’real‘ context.
We can, of course, analyze this sentence with the grammar in it. We can break it down. And when you do so, you may get to the point where you ask, what is this phrase – „What is these?!„ – but does it mean anything? Or what does †it mean? This ‚phrase‛ or ‛statement‟ is a ‹part-of-speech‹. It belongs to a larger, broader concept. But if what it belongs, means, why should I, be asking ‰the question, even though a question? In and of itself it doesn‚t mean, much. If I am, I may be looking for a definition, for its meaning. In this case, it may mean: what top ups? Top of what? If so: topups. Or it has an entirely different meaning; the question itself says so. So I can ask that question: ‟What Is What? What does that mean‌.› What do those words mean if anything at all? As for my intent for asking that – and if I want to be precise, then I might ask what do I mean – by asking, that, if anyone, which way that I ask is going to have an effect upon anyone? For that matter, how does my question change the listener, their intent? That is if they are listening, to this, as they should be. Are they? Are you? (No? OK.)
Let‡s say I say ‌what is those? top up‬. I have in some degree, defined the phrase ‍. ‬Now I‰m looking to find an answer, because I know there is no clear one. There is only a partial, vague one, an interpretation."

I think the question was about top-ups. ""What is your top up?"" is what I understood it to be about. But you seem to have taken it in another direction.

In this case, the best option is probably: ""What is your most recent success.""
Or:  ""How is everything going for you?""
I think the reason that your first suggestion, ""I'm just curious"" doesn't really work is because it sounds more like your own opinion than what you actually wanted to know, and you could be forgiven that, especially if you're not sure what your friend means.
This answer also makes much of the same assumption as the one you linked to.  It seems to assume that the listener should not have a reason for asking, which is a common and legitimate way to structure most conversations."
346,Do You Have A Top-Up Limit?,Considering this utterance: Do You Have A Top-Up Limit? What is the intent that best describes it?,".

""Do you have a top-up limit?"", is more than likely, a polite question. The meaning here will not change, no matter how much you think of changing it to something else. You would probably say:
What do you mean by “do you”?
Would you like to change the meaning of the phrase, to better convey your intent. Is it a request to know how many topups you can take. In this case a better phrasing would be: ""Do You have any top up limit?"".
The question, ""do"" or ""does"", are two different words, and convey different things depending on how they are used. If you use them interchangeably and with different prepositions, the result is different meanings. For example, If someone asked you, 'Do your parents live in your country', the first word 'do' is used to ask the question and give the reply, whereas the second word (your parents) is just being used as an adjective."

348,What Is The Limit To Top-Up?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Limit To Top-Up? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?
How can I improve it? Should it be changed to the following version? What would be the best intent? 

What’s the limit to top-up?

  The most common usage of ""limit"" would seem to indicate a cap or limitation on what something can be used for.   That is a little vague to me, because it could mean the maximum value that the amount of something that it costs. For example, the price tag on the phone or the car might be $5,000. If the customer tries to charge more than $5000, it is not ""a limit""; it can't be charged anymore. But if the company has a limit of $1,500 per day, then the charge will stop at $1500 a day and the remaining balance will remain a ""balance"" that can still be accumulated. Or if a store is limited to $100 per purchase, and a shopper tries $600, there is still $400 to go. The limit would prevent it from being ""recharged"".
""Limit"" can also mean a restriction of time. I know when I take a flight, I get a certain number of free checked bags. That number is called a “limit”. This could also apply to a time limit such as how long it takes to pay a bill, to be served or to close a position.
It is also sometimes used to describe limits. In sports, you get your allotted amount a given period of training/playing time in a season, or a number you can use for substitutions or subs in the game. Sometimes you also have a practice limit, a training limit or even a recovery limit. Those are just a few of many, many usage examples of ‘limits�‘, especially in reference to time limits, but there also many more examples. Limits can include the number allowed to vote in an election, number to enter the room, age to become an apprentice or employee in certain trades etc. etc., all the way down even to ’number of children allowed in your home“, etc, just the tip of the proverbial ice berg."

If you guessed ‘top-up to a card’, and even if you have a good reason for being unsure, you may be wondering how you can use this idea in more than one sentence or idea.
To help you with that, I‘m presenting a list of synonyms, or variations in meaning, of this one-word concept. You can find it in the “List of ideas about cards – with synonym, antonythesis, antithesis” section. For those not familiar with the concept of an anaglyphe and how it applies here, a synset of a word is a group of all words which share the same root. This list is an example of the use of several synsets and so you will be able to create multiple sentences based on the top-off to the card idea, without needing to re-think and come up with a new idea each time. There are so many variations possible, as these are syn-sets of only one word. So you might need to search for more information online to find the variations that are the closest to what you want. The more variations on one concept you are able, the richer your vocabulary. That is also the case with this list. In addition to being a ’top off to‬“ concept, each syn set contains several other variations for you to choose from. Some of them are:
‪‫‭top up to card, top off,
top a off
off of card
card a top
Card a Top

toc and cardOff the of top toCard the off off of

There are more possible ‪variations on this concept in this section, but you should get the idea of how I work. I will show you some more examples below. If you need more help on any point, please ask, in English or in German - either way is fine.‣
Here is another idea that might be of use to you, this time from the list below: What are"
350,How Much Can I Top Up?,Considering this utterance: How Much Can I Top Up? What is the intent that best describes it?,"(for the sake of this argument we will assume the first)? Is there a difference between the two?
I have a vague idea the phrase ""can"" implies an ability on the part of the speaker (as an indication of possibility) while ""top up"" suggests a state (or status) of being filled.

A:
The best way to explain it is to look at its context. For instance, if you are asking if someone can buy a large quantity of something (like food) then the ""how much"", is just the word ""much"". It could be: ""How much can I buy?"" or ""Can I get a whole case for the same price as the one I'm buying now?"". If you had to ""toke it to the top"" then we probably already know it's a metaphor. 
But, for example, in a sentence like ""I can do it, but I haven't top'd it"". The ""not"" makes it an action word. The phrase you quoted, ""To top up my tank"", implies you can get the fuel into your tank, by filling it up, or topping up your own tank. But you're not doing it. You're asking about it and then someone else (the other party?) is doing the actual action."
351,What Is The Most I Can Top Up?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Most I Can Top Up? What is the intent that best describes it?,".

""What Is""
(or ""Why"")
What is this phrase intended to convey to the listener?
Is it the same to you as it is to me? 
I would answer yes, because it seems to be a general purpose question.   However, I think it's a little unclear at first glance. For example, you might hear this as:
Can I top up my credit card/my phone/what? - ""If I can"" or ""What would I do if I could?""
Or it can be:  Can I pay you for a coffee / lunch / taxi ride? (depending if your client is a business or a friend. If you are in a restaurant, for example)
So if ""what"" in general is asking ""why"", as in ""Can you tell me why""  or asking for more detail as ""Did you say X?"" then that is not the correct meaning. Rather, it would be asking something like: ""Will you do X for me if/when I have the money?"" So in this case, ""How"" means ""if"" and ""Who will be X?"". This is similar to ""when"" as opposed to a more specific ""When"".
If someone says ""I'm thinking of X"". What does that mean? Does it mean ""X"" is on the horizon, or is it something else entirely? How is your best guess as to what they are actually referring to?"
352,Is There A Limit To How High I Can Top-Up?,Considering this utterance: Is There A Limit To How High I Can Top-Up? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? I would like to be able to write an essay on this topic, and I am really struggling to find an appropriate one.

A:
As you can see, the question title is a little bit ambiguous to me. You could use any of: 
Can I...
Could I...
How high can I...?
Do I have to...?"
353,Is There An Amount Limit To My Top-Up?,Considering this utterance: Is There An Amount Limit To My Top-Up? What is the intent that best describes it?,".

A:
* * *I think it's a good sign that I'm using so few characters so far.*
B: I was thinking about that, too. 
The sentence as written doesn't express any particular thought. The first sentence has ""so far"" in it. You could replace it with ""to date"" or ""thus far."" The second sentence is too vague. It doesn’t say much. I would probably think one of these. But I don't really have a preference for a single over the other."
354,Is There A Limit For Top-Ups?,Considering this utterance: Is There A Limit For Top-Ups? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? 

A:
There is a difference between the different uses of ""express"" in this question. If you're referring to the phrase ""I'm expressing..."" then you'll need a verb in the active voice, in which case an appropriate verb to use is ""speak."" If, however, you mean to refer to something that's expressed in a certain way, or by a particular person, then ""expression"" works."
355,Is There A Maximum I Can Top Up?,Considering this utterance: Is There A Maximum I Can Top Up? What is the intent that best describes it?,"(and if you need more words, how many)?

A:
This is a very interesting topic, with a somewhat complex answer.
First of all, there is no maximum amount you can ""top up"", but you are probably talking about a bank limit. 
When speaking of money, the word ""max"" usually means something like ""the maximum value or limit"". For example, in the phrase ""I spent all my money on my birthday last summer"", the ""money spent on"" is maximum (amount).
The other part of your phrase is ""can top up"". ""Can top"" means ""be able to top"", and this is not something that you usually hear in everyday conversations. It's a legal term, and means that if a company gives you a credit card, you have to use the card in certain ways and can't go over the limit, as explained on this answer about the meaning of ""maximum credit"".  In particular, if ""topping up"" = ""capping"" (as the answer points out), then it means using the credit limit on the other side, but it doesn't mean that ""spending max amount"" isn't a valid phrase."
356,How Can I Tell If There Is A Top-Up Limit?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Tell If There Is A Top-Up Limit? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

""If the amount of interest charged for a period exceeds the total amount paid by the borrower in that period for the purpose of financing the loan, the excess interest is not permitted by law, and no interest shall be charged on the principal, including interest on interest.""
(The first part of this statute prohibits charging of excess finance charges in excess of the interest and other charges paid in the period. The second part prohibits excess charges as interest, i.e. charging an APR of 1,000%.)
Which of these is best as expressed in a single word? Or, in short, would it be better to use 2 words instead of 2? I'd prefer to avoid using the verb ""to charge,"" since this word is usually associated with the concept of charging fees to the consumer.
I'm not looking to make a case for one phrase over the other. Just curious about what's the best way of conveying the idea in 1 word or 2. I know the first sentence is a bit ambiguous, but the second is unambiguous.  
If I could choose either sentence to convey the ""best"" I wanted, I would prefer the 2nd, for two reasons: ""not to"" implies it's OK to charge interest/finance charges, whereas the language for ""no"" is much clearer. If I had a chance to change the sentence, it would be the one beginning with 'if' because I think it implies more clarity about the meaning. Is that enough of an argument to choose the 1st of those two sentences, or is there a better way to phrase the thought?  I also thought if it had been ""If there is interest for finance"" or ""there is finance interest"", it might make more clear that you are talking about interest as opposed to finance, although I doubt the distinction would make much difference to most people. It also seemed strange to me to say there's finance when you clearly have a loan with finance. Maybe there just isn't any meaning to this distinction? What are some other possibilities? How might the 3rd or 4th sentence be clearer? (I know about 4 sentences isn'e allowed; I don't need a full rewording of that rule.)  How would I say this differently, if I was trying to express the same meaning? Maybe just changing """
357,Do You Have Any Restrictions To My Top-Up?,Considering this utterance: Do You Have Any Restrictions To My Top-Up? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

a)
To be able to add to the top-up
b) To be unable to top up
c) There is no top limit on adding to my topup.
d) You have to ask the dealer about any restrictions on using top ups."
358,As For Limits Are Top Ups Included?,Considering this utterance: As For Limits Are Top Ups Included? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
""Top Up"" in a sense you are talking about here means to ""buy the extra amount of a specific product to get one unit of that product"".
Now, the question asks: is this a valid usage of this phrase? And the answer to that is definitely yes.
The only issue that might arise is that it can be used to refer to a top-up account. For example, when you have the ""Top-Up"" function, your mobile phone company may charge you a monthly fee on top of the amount that you can top up in the month. This topUp account may be separate from your monthly account, or it may go into your phone bill on a different line. 
So, to summarize: in this case, ""top-ups"" are just extra, you might have a ""bottom-of-the-month"" account that does not receive any monthly charges, and ""to top the account up"" means that some amount is added to your account at the end of each month, whether that amount be money, a service or anything else."
359,Which Cards And Currencies Do You Support?,Considering this utterance: Which Cards And Currencies Do You Support? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? I'm not sure I understand your answer but I'll take a shot at it. Your answer is probably not as good as I am hoping for.

The intent in this case is to ask: What card, currency or both, do you support?
There may not be a word or phrase to express this intent but there probably is a way you can express it in a few words. It's just not the same way that you expressed the one word question of which you chose as an example: Why do we play Cards? If this post does a bad job of communicating my intent I would be happy to provide an additional example that does better. I know for sure what I intended in that case. (I was hoping to get more hits for this question than I did)
My intent is that others have their own intent when they use my post. Maybe I should have explained what is meant by Cards and Currneties. A card or coin is just one unit of currency. Cards have value in games because they give a player the opportunity to win a certain amount of money, usually a lot of it for some games of this kind. You can buy them at your local card store or you buy cards over the Internet from an online card shop. They come in many varieties. Sometimes the cards you get at a card game are not worth very much, but some cards can have a very high value. The value or a game may even be based on the value of a particular card. In most cases you don't get many cards for free, they are usually bought with game points (usually points from the previous game). Currencty is more of an abstract concept, it is something you pay to use when you use your currency (your card) to buy things. Curreicncy is used for things like phone, electric, internet, car, food, clothing, housing, etc. When you want to purchase something with currency you have to do a little more research because there are different prices for different currencies. Most people use currency and cards to play the games they play. Some people buy a deck of cards that have cards with different values on them (e. g. a dollar sign, an ace of spade) in order to help them play a specific game that has a similar set of rules. For those people a high valued card"
360,Where Can I Obtain My Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Where Can I Obtain My Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

This is a good question. There are many ways to describe it, all of them correct, but not necessarily all equally helpful.
As a native English speaker, one might say, “Where can I obtain a card to use for virtual transactions?“. This is perfectly acceptable, although it may not help the client identify the most appropriate choice, or the best choice. ‘Obtain’ might be an imprecise term, as one is either obtaining something from somewhere, which suggests that there might not be anywhere to obtain it. A virtual card might actually be obtained from a bank or some other virtual entity. If your organization has a virtual system, where you can obtain that virtual account, then that is probably what you are talking about. That is where the card you have already is located. You don‘t need a separate card. It is what it is. The virtual aspect, if used, is something different, and is covered in a later posting. Also, in the context of this posting, the term ’virtual” seems too specific, so instead, say ” card ‐‐–or, card account„. 
To make your question more clear, here is an example: ″Where is my virtual credit card? ‪I want a way to make purchases with my personal virtual bank account.‬‹Where am I purchasing and what do I purchase?″ This seems to be a fairly broad question, since I am asking you for a solution. However, it‪s important to know the purpose that will be fulfilled, before selecting a technology. So, first, determine what the answer you need to give will accomplish, that being your objective. Then answer based on the objective, not the technology you will use. For example, you might ask someone to call your virtual banking service and provide a credit number. To accomplish that, there must be such a service. In that case, asking which service it might require is not relevant. Instead, simply ask, ""Is there a number I need that does what I want?"" Then, select the appropriate solution, depending on what is best for your needs."
361,How Do You Get A Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: How Do You Get A Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

You could say: “how do you get a virtual card?” This is an example of an indirect question. The word ‘How’ indicates a statement or question about the subject of the sentence. In this case, it is a query about how to get. You can also say ”why should one use a Virtual card.“
In the indirect sentence the listener is asked a question and he or she must make a decision as to the meaning the speaker desires to convey. Indirect questions are used for emphasis.
There are two parts to every question, the what and the where. This can be expressed in a sentence as such:
‘ What is it that you want?/What do they want you to do? (where you can put the question ’that ‡‖ you)‬).
If you asked the above question directly, this is how it would sound: I want to know what you would like. (what is what, you could replace the pronoun with a noun, and vice versa.)
I want this because I think it‚‰œll be useful. =›‹… (why you do this, where you put it)
The indirect form of a direct question allows you‛„Œ‟‪to express a request which is made by using ‚that. It can then be asked ‛how, ‹when,‷‫where etc. and „what‸. When you ask ‗how? you are giving an explanation about what the other person should do. Why this or that? You are asking what reason or motives the person has and why they would act or respond to it in such and such way. ‑when allows you ‬to specify a certain time-period when the action will occur , for example: when ‏I‭ get it. Here, when is ‪the time that the request will take place . And where is where the answer will be accepted (the person to whom you give it). In the case of †where‏, I could ask where do I go to. For example, if I ask you, ""where do we go"" you will need to specify what I need"
362,Where Can I Find A Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Where Can I Find A Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

You have to have the card before you can open a new account.You can find the virtual card by using a web browser at the following link (the page will ask for your bank account details): https://pay.visa.com/?s_account=... This will open up your Virtual Visa™ Debit Card on the Visa payment network.

For questions about your MasterCard/Discover card or to get your card replaced, call the Consumer Care Centre at 1-800-DYNAMIC or visit the Master Card Worldwide Web site here. Or, if you lost your debit card with your other card company and need a replacement, contact them directly.

'I wish for this.'
or 'This is what I want.'? Or even 'I would like to do X.', or even just 'Would you like some water please?' or 'Do you want to hear a song?'.

368,What Is The Virtual Card,Considering this utterance: What Is The Virtual Card What is the intent that best describes it?,"? (Think about this for as long as you need to in order to make up your mind)

You’re probably thinking: “How can this be the same intent?”
If so, you are using the wrong method to think in a creative way! (It‘s a different method from the one you may be using when it comes to thinking rationally and scientifically. That‡s why the two are so different!)
The difference between the ”what do you think it means? ’and the“What do I mean?´ method is that the first way of thinking requires you to ask:‭‬‪‫what‚  is the›intent‮. ‏‰‥‹‌‼„‖  †
And the second way uses the method ‘ What ‚do you mean• ′?
It requires the question: what‿is the intended meaning of the utterances you made in the world as the speaker and in your own mind.
There is a difference that cannot be missed between these two different questions because the answer to the latter is always the result of a subjective choice. The first question allows us to take a step into the mind of others. To be able to understand other people we have to be sensitive to their intentions and feelings! We have no way to find out about another person‣s‱intention…until we can „see into․ their mind‟

But how do we find what a person meant or wanted to communicate with us in an uttering?

369,How Do I Get A Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Get A Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,".

What is a Virtual card as opposed to a conventional or real one? Can a card be virtual when you are not actually on a computer at present or a virtual card when actually standing on the street at a location that is not a local?
If it can, are there any other conditions that need to take place in order for such a condition to exist? I have tried to find a definition by Googling without luck. A real card is tangible (or at least in a physical sense) as well as being a type of card or currency. The phrase “virtual card” can be used for money or other items that do not have to be physical. If such items are to have the same function as actual currency, then the definition can apply to all physical items of currency including cash, coins, notes and any paper and metal or plastic material that has its value as currency or in trade or exchange.  
Note: This answer is based on what I am presently aware and is probably in error and should be accepted only until a better answer comes along. This question is for the English Language and Usage Stack Exchange. Thanks for any thoughts or comments. – Ed."

While writing, students have to be able to analyze the text to know how it functions as an essay. They should also be aware of how the various paragraphs work in conjunction with one another to create an entire story. Students have various resources available to them and there is always a way to do it the easy way. It just requires a bit of hard work, dedication and determination. Most people, especially the ones who have not tried it on their own, tend to use the internet when it comes to writing. But as they say,"
372,How Can I Order Virtual Cards?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Order Virtual Cards? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

In your view what are the pros and cons of a single word and a two word answer respectively? Which answer is better suited? Why?


A: I need a Virtual Card
B: Can you provide a virtual card?"
373,Can You Tell Me Where I Can Order A Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Can You Tell Me Where I Can Order A Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

Intent is not limited to human intent. It can also be applied to the behavior of a computer, to determine what it will or will not do. If the system has the ability to do something (can, may, will) and it does not have intent to that action and the person does something that causes the result then the machine has intent (may, would, should). Intent is used to describe the goals or intentions of people, as well as things, machines and concepts.
- Intent and its opposite are closely coupled, and are frequently confused, even by people who know the difference. A machine that behaves the same each time you give it the instructions to perform the desired tasks is said to be ""non-volitional"" because it is merely following the rules of the program it has been instructed to run. However, intent is a more human-oriented attribute that deals with goals and intentions. Thus, it describes things that have a mind of their own, such as people or computers, which are able to act and react according to their goals when the conditions are right, or that are programmed to behave according the desires of those who design them."
374,Is It Possible For Me To Get A Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Is It Possible For Me To Get A Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,", or a sentence, in a conversation?

For example, if we were talking about getting a credit card:
The intent could be stated as: Get a virtual
card.
or, Get My virtual card."
375,Is This Where I Order A Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Is This Where I Order A Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

It is a statement of intent.
Intent is often considered to be one of three things: to state what you want, to intend to do something, and to feel that you should do or do not do things
There are many other variations, but this is sufficient for now. (I have used all three in this post)
We often want (want), we sometimes intend (intend) and we often feel (feel) that we should
or should not (should) do certain things. The most common of these in relation to language is we ""want (to)"" or ""intend (on)"".
In most cases we can say that ""to want"" means we want to ""state what we are intending to""
(not in all cases - see later in my post). ""On the other hand, ""intent to is somewhat less common than ""intending to.  
So what does it mean to say ""I will/I am gonna/ I'm gonna"" (insert your choice of the verb form here)  the virtual card?  It means that, that's what I am or will be doing! or That's it? or What's the point? The point is to get the money (money is implied and often expressed to) out of my bank account into the ""virtual"" card account. If there is no ""money"", I may ""put in"" the intention to pay for it, (and put it somewhere on my person). I do intend or I want or feel I should put the $50 into that account because it will go into effect as soon as I sign the order (but in reality, until some other time when I ""take it out"").
Let's use this in a couple of examples:1. ""It's a nice day outside today (for you)!  I have been planning to leave work early today and go for a walk in the park, so I will ""go"" ahead and order a ""Card. I intend"" to use the Card for the day.2. It may be ""tomorrow"" when my next paycheck is due - so this ""is a good time"" - (it may not be - but it is now) - to make a deposit for my ""next"" paycheck and I'll go order that Card. This one is not as clear"
376,What Are The Steps To Getting A Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: What Are The Steps To Getting A Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?
To be specific, you have the following phrase:

What Are the Steps to Getting a Virtual Credit Card
(To help your business succeed.)
The answer is: The verb ""to get""
and the noun ""steps"" and ""credit card"" follow each other in the same order
as they appear in this sentence.
It's a little more complicated
than that, but in essence, the sentence is saying you want to do something,
like ""get"" or ""have.""
You can see that a virtual credit card is an
in-process ""something"" you can do. It's not a credit
card yet (you haven't done anything yet to have an actual
credit
""something""). And since it is
an in-progress action you could
say you are in a process of ""getting"" the virtual card. And finally, since virtual
cards are a product (something you ""do"" to your clients), your
business' ""success"" is a
goal or outcome you hope to accomplish. That gives you
a sense of how the phrase should be parsed: ""What are
the steps to getting a [virtual credit] card (to help
your business [goal/outcome])?""
I hope that helps. If
it did, please leave me a comment."
377,Help Me Obtain A Virtual Card,Considering this utterance: Help Me Obtain A Virtual Card What is the intent that best describes it?,", or the utterances that comprise the clause?

What do you think of:
""I am in need of assistance in obtaining a VISA credit card.""
vs.
Help Me. Obtaining a Virtual Credit Card
or
Can You Help. Me
etc.?
Or perhaps a different phrasing to reflect the different meaning? 
For example, one might choose the following:   Can You Assist. In Obaining a _____. Credit
card? Or, perhaps: My Bank Is Insufficient To ____. My Account? or Help! My account's $0
balance has reached its maximum capacity.  Which of these phrasings are correct? What might be an appropriate word or phrase to describe the subject being expressed? Why would you choose this word?"
378,Where Is The Virtual Card Located?,Considering this utterance: Where Is The Virtual Card Located? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

For example: (This is more of an example than a question)
Where is this card? / Where's that card that you had? (The first one is ambiguous. Where does the card go? Is your question asking, where is it? Or where did you put it?).
I need to know about this? What's the deal with that?/ (What? I think it's a common question used in various forms with different intent from where can I get that?). 
The second sentence might be considered a short version of the first question or an extension of it. I'm thinking it might have something to do with the ""Where do you need it?"" phrase.
Another example.  

  ""Can you tell me, what is that on TV?"" (I'd be more inclined to interpret ""what is"" as what's).
This may sound like a very simple question but I don't know the exact answer.

 ""What's up with this?""
 What does he mean?  (Or maybe a simple curiosity question that would lead to more.)  Or it could mean, how is he doing. Or what do I mean. This is one I haven't even heard before or thought too much about, but it is on the tip of my tongue. If I was a person who was not familiar with it, I'd assume it was some reference to technology. But since I am familiar I have a slightly different perception and understand it differently. Which of these 3 would be most likely to be understood from a quick casual glance?

 I wonder if this has happened to you, too? How did it happen? ""How did this happen to our friend? We need someone to fix this right away.""

 Where did that come from? A question about origin. Who or what gave rise to it or created it from whom or from whatever it would have come and where it came from. It's like an open ended question where there is no exact response possible. You just need the right words to get the person to give you the information you are looking for. For me it feels like ""Who?"" or ""From who?"".

 What are you going to tell them, the doctors? The medical staff. They're the ones who will see what the problem is and how to solve it.""
  Is there a more correct term"
379,Where Can I Order A Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Where Can I Order A Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"(and is this what makes or breaks you)? What do you want it to convey?

What's a sentence? Is a verb and one of a list of prepositions (if any) considered a single sentence - ""Where can I order a virtual card"" - or is there one verb in this? 
Is the sentence a clause? If yes it should be a noun phrase and not a preposition.
Are these the three? Or are there more? How many? Are they the same or different? What are the names of the categories? Why are they necessary and how do we know they're necessary? I'd appreciate an explanation if any more can be found!
Note that in all cases, if there are more than one category of part of speech, which one is it? Can all parts of it be the whole thing? For example: noun, adjective, adverb; noun+verb, noun+(adverb+preposition); noun-(prepositional+noun); verb-(adj. + pre.), verb-n. (-ad. etc.)."
380,Where Do I Obtain My Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Where Do I Obtain My Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I am interested in the following:
1) How do you choose words that are meaningful? That best
fit the context? What words would you use for this phrase above? Can you think of others? If you can't think or can of no other words than are used for the phrase, what would those words mean? Would they be different if you were reading a foreign language? (That is, if the sentence was written by someone who did not speak your language or read the English words you do speak.)
2) Can the meaning be changed by changing a word or words and keeping the overall sense of the rest of text that you've chosen? Or does meaning depend only on using the same words as were used in this case here? In this context, it means the way the words are arranged, not the individual words themselves.
3) Are different words in a sentence used to convey a different message? For example, is this sentence saying that someone has a virtual card: ""He's got a VirtualCard"", or, ""She has one?""
This may be more than one question, but they are inter-related. I don't want to answer them all in one post, since to do so would be tedious, long, and confusing. So my apologies. But it seems more efficient to have one thread per question.  If so, feel free to start a new thread with a link to the other thread and I can close this one. Or if anyone has any suggestions (other than to split the question into more threads) let me know. Thanks. Please feel to ask any questions that come to mind about this. The main ones above seem to be my most immediate concern. And as for my ""style"" of posting, I am a writer, so that is my natural method of expression. That being said, this may seem very wordy and perhaps verbose, though it doesn't seem so in my head when I'm writing it. If it is in your opinion, please let the readers of this thread know, by voting accordingly. For what it's worth, my post is on the last page in case anyone reads it that way. Thank you!
EDIT
To clarify a couple of aspects of my question: I understand that there is always a degree of interpretation on my part that I could be wrong about. A"
381,I Want A Virtual Card!,Considering this utterance: I Want A Virtual Card! What is the intent that best describes it?,"? The intent is not stated. Is it implied or inferred? It's stated, but not really.

The intent behind a sentence can be stated or implied, depending on the context. A statement of an intent can come from any number of sources including words, body language, tone of voice or even silence. This is called the 'inferred intent.' As long as the listener is able to identify the inferred intent and interpret it correctly, the communication has been successful. However, there is a problem in that if the meaning of a communication is too ambiguous or unclear to the recipient it could have the potential of misunderstanding or miscommunication. The ability to recognize and identify an 'unstated' intent has become one of the most valuable skills in the modern world, especially in business as well as in personal and social interaction. If we know the intended meaning behind any communication, we can better predict the consequences of its actions. We know when the other person is trying to be friendly and when they are being aggressive or intimidating. When we don't know what somebody is thinking, it's like we're blindfolded and can't predict their behavior or the outcome of any interaction we have. I'm sure it happens that you have had a situation where you've had to guess as to exactly what the person meant or didn't mean, so you were caught off guard by a reaction and had no idea why the words were the way they were, or why your body was reacting or moving in a certain way. In some of these situations you could just as easily have been able be more successful communicating your intent if you had taken some time to think about what you meant. It is this skill of inferred meaning that can really be a challenge to master and to use on a daily basis. That's where the idea of 'Invisible Intents' come in. These are the intents that are not said, only inferred when you look at the results of communication. You have to'read between the lines' and use your intuition to make these inferences. Here are some examples of some ways to do this:
A) ""I would like to talk to you about this issue.""
B) The response to A is, ""Sure, what's up?""
Intent is inferred from this because you do know that the statement was made. But, is it really? We can look into the future"
382,I Want One Of Those Virtual Cards!,Considering this utterance: I Want One Of Those Virtual Cards! What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I Want
This uttering means: 
(i) I desire to have an object, such as money, or anything tangible: ""I'd like to buy that dress you're wearing"" and “I want to go to Paris.”
But it can also convey:
 (ii) a wish for an intangible object such that it is not immediately possible to purchase an item that would satisfy the wish.
For example: ”I’d like a promotion; I want a raise“ and, ‹I don‘t want that. We„d better not discuss it. - „I really want this new promotion, but, well, you know we have other priorities‹
Or, if the context is such, that the person cannot get the thing they desire because they are in a position from which they cannot obtain it:   ″The boss isn‚t going to give me that promotion. It‛s not worth the hassle. I really don.t care; it›s just a job. ""
You also have the ‛want‰.  It is a verb meaning ‚I desire‭. As in ‬‪We want the money‬ to pay our taxes‌""I hope to meet her soon. She wants to get together next week .I can't say for sure, though—I just want her to ‖. ‌
There is also the possessive ‖‟my desire. My desire, is something that I can have. In the same way that my car, my cat, and my wife are objects that can be possessed by me, so too, I am something I wish to possess. This is my ‗‱‏ ″I. A want, as in the want‮;   A desire as to what I will have‡ ‒ ‗What I possess, what belongs to me. The possessiveness of my desire is illustrated by the phrase ‘′–I have it all.

383,Are Virtual Cards Available To Get?,Considering this utterance: Are Virtual Cards Available To Get? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? I can see that the phrase is a question, yet in my head, I thought it was an answer, in the sense the speaker wants an understanding of his intent.

A:
[This is an interesting question. To my mind, an important part of what you want to do is to make sure you understand the word ""available"".
The word is often applied to things that are ""free"". You can buy a bottle of wine, and that wine is freely available to you, even if your parents insist you drink milk in your tea. If you're buying your own computer, it's not ""made available"" to the store, because the computer isn't freely ""given"" away, just because you paid for it. (And yes, there are companies that sell hardware that is ""on sale"", but I hope the examples are clear.)
If you pay with your Visa or MasterCard, the bank has freely given away the ability to spend money. It is also able to reverse the charge if you do not pay the bill. You're the one who doesn't want the money, not the cardholder. In this case, you have the option of ""declining"" the charges, i.e. not using the Visa. So there's no charge, no card or anything else ""in hand"", and so no ""virtual card"" involved. The charges are just reversed. ]
You have to understand that ""a credit card is issued to me, so therefore I must pay you back"". It's a bit like paying off your mortgage with a check rather than paying the same amount to your bank (and then having a ""checking account"")."
384,Can You Help Me Sign Up For A Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Can You Help Me Sign Up For A Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? A) I want to be able to send my friend a virtual card with a picture of me on it. B) If she wants to do that for me, she can go to this site and send her own card to the people she knows. C) Can you help me sign up for this service?

Here’s the question: The question to ask yourself in order to know a word or phrase like Can‘t help you signup.
What do you think it means? It would be best if you could provide the answer to support your claim. For the benefit of others."
385,Can I Get A Copy Of The Card By Email?,Considering this utterance: Can I Get A Copy Of The Card By Email? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? It would make sense that the phrase would describe the same exact thing as, Can You Get An Email With The Bill? What the latter question is trying to communicate is, can you get a printed copy of the bill. The intent is not the answer for the former because there is a chance you could end up with an email that you can’t open or view. In the case of, I Can Get a Copy of The.

It‘s the second question of your two-question series. Let“s go there together now. This one is for you to answer. Write the question down. Can you go a. How did you do, so far? I”ll take the test, and I can see what I did wrong. Then we talk about what you did right. If you pass, you„ll be able to move on to the next question, “Can you find your way home from here?‟ This question may seem pretty simple until you look closer at the sentence.

386,Where Do I Find The Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Where Do I Find The Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The first one:
It describes an action that the speaker wants to perform to get something.
I think that it is an attempt to create a verb that describes the same as ""to get"". In addition, I think you can translate it into English the way it works. It would be: I must find the virtual card so that I don't have to pay the late fees. I understand it as: ""To be able to do something, you must do it"" in other words, there is no way I will go to the bank and ask the person in charge if I can pay them some money. In this case, the verb is ""Must"" or ""Need To"".
Second: There is also such a meaning in the phrase: In order to achieve that. (As an explanation)
So I would translate the sentence as:""In order, to complete that action, one must first find it"". I mean, without ""In Order"" the original sentence becomes:In this state I do not want to have that debt, in order not to find my card in my coat.""
And that is why I say that this is a phrasal verb: it combines the meaning of ""in order"" with the idea of action. And that's why it's translated as must. Because you ""need"" to take this action in this precise time. The sentence is not ambiguous and could be translated in English in a more understandable way. For instance, ""I need to finish before the deadline (or: in that state, with those facts, it doesn't make sense for me to not do that)"". If it were translated into another language, they could use other verb. 
There's also the third one:""Must, mustn't"" (as a response). That is very ambiguous. If I tell you that you have a car and you say: Can I drive it, then: Yes, no problem, because I have the license and it hasn't been reported stolen. But, if you ask: Do you want that, do you need that (without any other information about it) and I respond: No, don' want it and no, but I need it: You have two options: To answer that with:  I'm not the one that has that car, so ""no, that thing doesn’t"
387,Why Do I Not Have A Virtual Card,Considering this utterance: Why Do I Not Have A Virtual Card What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I am not a linguist, so I can’t tell for sure what the best way of expressing this thought is, but I believe the following sentence conveys the thought of it in an understandable way:
“Why don”t I have a virtual card‡? [‘Why does it seem as if I don't have any virtual cards?„]
(‖ is a typo, it‚Äôs supposed to be an ‚àƒ‰ symbol)
My question is this: if there are two versions of this sentence, both of which convey the same thought without being wrong, why do I need to use the more complicated version? It seems to me if this simpler version, “‛Why is it as though I do not have? virtual-cards""†' is incorrect, wouldn‹ƚ, the ›à› is redundant.
†‭: ’What is its meaning? Why would you express it this way? Is it grammatically correct? Would it be a different kind of word altogether? How should I use it? Are there any other instances of sentences that can express the meaning as well? If so, what are they? ‹
§‮: The following sentences do the job of the sentences at (†) and (․):

But I did not see a place for it (or them), so that I came here. (I thought it would say: the reason I couldn …). ‬
The following doesn't seem to convey an intent of any kind, though. 
Because it sounds like an expression of a wish (a request), not of an opinion. I think it could mean ""I don' t have enough time"" but not ""Because I want it that way.""†  ‘
There are so many ways of saying ""It seems as  if..."". But what is more common?†† Are the versions at the end of sentence (1) more often used than the ones at their"
388,How Do I Order A Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Order A Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

What do you mean by “intent-based understanding?” I assume that it is a different interpretation than just the grammatical interpretation. For example, ‘I would love some more coffee’ has a similar gramatical interpretation, but is very different in its intended meaning.

Re: ‌‌How Do ’I Order a Virtual ​ Card‍? [AACF, ACF-VF]
Hi. Thanks for all the information. I think I'm beginning to understand a lot better how a sentence like that would convey meaning!
I like @kentdixon answer, so I will use that! It was very helpful explaining intent, which makes sense. So, what I was looking to do is: I would like to order a virtual card
The meaning is clear to me, and I like it. But it has one thing I don't like. The ""card""-part in ""virtual card."" In the ""How-to-Order"" article, I see no need for it to use a ""verb"" instead of a noun. Why not ""I want a card?"" ""Virtual card"" could be a more neutral, non-adjective description for something, without the verb. If I order, it will automatically be an ordering of an ""inanimate"" object. It would be like me saying ""You know, we need to go to the grocery store soon."" I am ordering a grocery. Maybe, the sentence structure ""you know"" would imply that I wanted or needed a physical object? Maybe you have a better idea? This sentence is meant to be casual and casual communication is often a bit awkward and indirect. And I want it, not need it! I know my sentence sounds strange to you, because if I said ""We need a new grocery,"" it would make so much more sense to everyone... (I'm just an American.) I'll be glad to know if you agree with this idea. -Sara

It' s the end of January, and the deadline to renew the card is February 1. I haven' t received the renewal notice. Should I renew my card right away? If you think renewing the credit. The following examples describe common business scenarios. We' ve just had a baby. He'n't even a month. You may be eligible to apply for a new credit score. In each, think about how to choose the best option based only on these two considerations: What would the recipient want to happen?
1. A company is in the business of making and selling widgets. They have the following expenses and revenue: (a) cost of raw materials = $1, (b) manufacturing costs = 15. For this analysis, you will be using the cash flow statement of a fictitious business called The Widget Company. Use the statement for TheWidget Co. to. Deciding On a Financial Advisor.

391,Can I Order A Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Can I Order A Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,", in which one word can be the subject of this phrase or part of it? In some cases the answer might be ""a virtual card"" or ""an online credit card"".

For those who are interested, I just started my quest for a new card in an era of ""fraud avoidance"". I'm going to try to keep it simple for the sake of simplicity, while the reality is a whole lot of complexity. This post is my starting point for that journey, which is in its early stages.
The idea is to be proactive against fraud while minimizing inconvenience and cost. The most important thing to me right now is flexibility to change my mind if that becomes necessary. For example, if a major problem arises with the current credit report, or if the new reporting agency provides a less-than-satisfactory credit score with some combination of credit and payment history, then I would need to make a change very quickly. That's a big problem for me. I hate changing anything more than the tires on the car. My current card is tied pretty closely to my bank account (no CC or other card, but the bank has been sending electronic payments to it for about eight years).
My credit history looks great, with few errors other than a couple of negative entries. There's no reason for major concern right off. If that changes in a bad way and I have to close my accounts, it's OK, too. It's not a problem. (It's also possible that some of the errors that I don't understand are legitimate.) The big question that needs to answered is whether my current payment experience will work. To answer that question, we need something that's going the right way with my payments. With credit cards, what I use is called ""debit card transactions"". It is basically the same as paying with a debit card (the credit goes to the account the card authorizes the payment for, and the amount is debited from the authorized account and posted to mine as the result of a transaction on their account). This is what you do all the time, even when you don’t have a credit or charge card. When you make your regular payments for gas and groceries and your electricity bill, you're doing a ""purchase transaction"" on your behalf with your bank. You authorize your payments, the payments are debits to your account,"
392,Where Can I Go To Get A Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Where Can I Go To Get A Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? The best answer is ""I would like to go to a place that has a machine where you can insert an identification card and get a virtual card for a fee."" The second best is to say ""A machine that you put an ID card into gets you a free virtual ID."" If your intent is only to get the card or ID and not pay any fee, then the best response would be to use the word ""card"" and then say the location is a vending machine. The response may not be quite as accurate. For example, ""Where do you go for an open machine to insert a card?""

What are two examples of an expression of intent for which the two best solutions are ""go to place a where an individual can get free ID"" or ""place where individuals go where they insert ID for free."" For each sentence, the verb is in bold.
1. I would rather play baseball than tennis, but I am not as good at the latter as I was a few years ago. (where to ""play"")

3. This is a non-sequitor because of an error in logic. It is not possible to locate the card in virtual or real time. If it were possible, the answer would be #3 in all cases. But, it is impossible to place the cards in their real address locations because the physical cards and their slots will not accept that the real location for any of these cards. In order for that to happen, all the slots would have to be reconfigured, and that would not be possible. That would require the entire machine to reboot."

If it is your first time using this service, what are all the different options that appear below this paragraph? I would Like to add a virtual credit card for my new account for online payment. (this should be on page three of the form) What if the user would enter a payment method (credit card) already, they are not using? what does he or she enter, or what kind of a form should it be? Can the virtual payment card be purchased and loaded to the account? How? What will happen when the service is not used for an extended period of time, and the balance drops below a certain point? Should the payment go to a new, more permanent card account, with a balance of zero? Or is there a method that allows you (the merchant who wants to sell the card to consumers) to make the transaction for a short period, so that you have a zero-balance account to work with when users return to your site? You get a temporary credit that is then transferred to another account of your choosing. When it gets low, you can either pay it off with the original account balance, if that exists, otherwise it just moves to an inactive account. Or do you just lose it completely? Which is what happens now on this site. This could be a very useful service for the Internet, but it seems like a huge mess to figure out. I can’t think of anything that could improve it. If someone who knows, could share some ideas on how this could work, I‘d really appreciate it! What If a transaction fails after it has been initiated by the customer or consumer? It should take place as soon as the consumer clicks to pay by credit or charge card (or whatever type of card he is using). The merchant gets his or her money, the credit is added to his credit account (if that's what was chosen). If the money was transferred from another credit (debit?) card that he has, then it will be added. No worries, this will not effect the merchant's balance! If however, a purchase is"
395,When Should I Receive My Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: When Should I Receive My Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? I think there is no right answer to this question.

It is a question that is asked on a daily basis. I receive my card, I put it somewhere, and then I forget where I’ve put the card. It is usually forgotten on the way to the bathroom, when I have my wallet in my pocket that I had put there because I was going out of the room. And when was I going to put that wallet back into the pocket? And then the moment when the wallet was out again, the key card was gone. That‘s the last time I remember it. Or I go to my room and there it is, sitting on my desk. So, what do I do? When I want to go somewhere in the city or when there are people waiting for me on their way somewhere?
– And do you carry it in your pocket in these moments? Is it your habit to take the keys out from your wallet every time when you” leave the apartment? This may sound like a very silly question but it makes you think more. For me, my habit is to place my cards in a plastic box inside the purse. In the other side, in an envelope marked with the name of each person, they have their card in one of those cards. As for the virtual card (as far as I understand it“s a virtual wallet, that„s what they call it). It‟s not really mine, there‬ are just a bunch of cards for other people. But when it comes to an emergency, if I need it, it helps to have all the cards with me. Also, this way is much more comfortable for when one person carries the plastic envelope and the another one has the bag. This is just my two cents. Hope it helped."
396,I Need To Reorder My Virtual Card!,Considering this utterance: I Need To Reorder My Virtual Card! What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Is it a command, an instruction, a request, etc.?

A:
I was able to get the answer through a combination of Google and my own knowledge and experience. So, here's the process: 
1. Start a new project in IntelliJ IDEA.  (I used the default project, and it created a Java class file.)
2. Right click on the project and go to Run --> Edit 'Run configurations'. The default Run/Debug config is selected.
3. Add a Run 'Gradle' task to the Run configurations. Select 'Debug with dependencies' and make sure the JUnit runner is set to 'JUnit'. Also, select the 'Include' option of the Gradle tasks to be included in the run. This will ensure all the classes that have been compiled from this build system are available to you, when you're running the test. Also make the classpath set. In case you are not aware, the Classpath in BuildConfig.groovy is an array that is evaluated as the value of class variable'main'.
4. Edit the build.gradle file of your project. The following is what I ended up with:

   dependencies {
  compile 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test'
}
tasks.whenTaskAdded { task ->
if (task.name.startsWith('org_spring_framework_gradletask')) {  // This check ensures we
don't run gradle task while we are running tests. If this line is uncommented, it will
cause the task not to start. We don't need that because we already added a task.

 task gradletasks { doFirst { println('Hello Gradletast') } }
 task compileTestJava { options.compilerArgs << '-Xlint:unchecked' }

 }  }}
compileTestCompile.doFirst{  gradles.tck.execute()}"
397,Where Can I Get A Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Where Can I Get A Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? How about: What Does My Credit Card Need?

In the same way as we think about intent when we speak, we need to consider the meaning we are seeking to convey with our writing. This might be the message you want to communicate or the effect you wish to achieve.
It is very important that you consider each sentence you write as having an effect on your reader’s mind. If you can get inside your readers‘ heads and know what you would prefer them to remember, or what action you hope they should take or which idea you expect them be interested in – then you are on the right path, because by doing this, you get the most out of your writing and it will be effective. The key word being effect!
If this makes sense to you at all, try writing your next essay using only the word effect. It doesn‟t have to be a long essay. Just pick one word that will make your point. Try it. You”ll be surprised at how far you„ll get! The effect is, after all...
Effect: an intended effect, as in “the effect of his argument“; „this had the expected effect‚‰‹› (obsolete); ‘′the intended result of an action‬ …‭, ‖‫‪the result expected from an act‖
How you make them think or feel or want something. Your aim is to get your message across. In your essay, think ‚ ‭ ‬ ‪how can I do this?‛ or, even better, write down what your argument or point needs to make the point you need it to. Now think of any words you might choose to use. Do you think it is worth the risk, to say the least, if you use this word? What would it do for you? It is a question of balance, but it might pay you not to risk it!‥
You could use words that are related in an obvious or less obvious way to your chosen word, using your mind to link together the two and to create a new effect; that is your choice. For example, here is an extract from my own work: † ’ ′ ″‡ ‡․  �"
398,Is There A Way To Obtain A Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Is There A Way To Obtain A Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

Consider a simple example from an online news source (I have no interest of the news site in question) of this statement:
The article was published last week.
It was a news statement about a topic, not a personal opinion of a particular person or organization. However, one of my favorite websites of all time is Quora, where anyone is given a question to answer. In the ""question & answer"" section of that website it reads: This is an interesting question. It really depends on how you want to look at it. Do you mean by a card to mean a computer, or a debit or credit card. For what purpose would a person use a virtual card? If you ask a programmer, he would say, ""Well, if your bank or retailer allows it, and the transaction was done securely."" If your answer is about online purchases, then you are using a secure payment gateway. So, in this case, for that purpose of purchasing stuff, the user might get a ""virtual card"" that can be used for all online transactions. If that is not the case for a retailer or bank, a user could still use something like paypal or amazon. I hope this helps."
399,Can I Have One Of The Virtual Cards?,Considering this utterance: Can I Have One Of The Virtual Cards? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? For example, can I have one of the virtual cards? I can think of two possible meanings: 1. I want to acquire one the two virtual game cards. 2. Can you give me one virtual card?

I think #1 makes more sense, but I am not sure, and am curious to know if anyone else sees these two phrases as saying different things.
If #2 is intended, is there a common way to say that?  Can anyone give an example that would be used to express the phrase Can You Give Me One? as an attempt to buy a virtual (game) card, or to be given it? In particular, what sort of response might the recipient of such an inquiry give? Would it be common, in the context of a game, to have a custom item? That is, custom, as in, something with your name on it, unique to you, made only to your specifications? (This might be akin to how custom-made suits, handbags, shoes, etc., are custom to the person who purchases or receives them.)
Note that I'm not talking about an actual custom game card here -- I mean one that is made for you only. 
This question came to mind as I read the following passage from the introduction of  The Magic of Words, a book by George Lakoff. It is from p. 7 of that link. A passage I found interesting was this:
""Many of our problems are really language problems.""
The ""many"" is probably too inclusive, though I doubt it has anything to do with the question at hand. (Perhaps it is a reference to ""linguistic"" problems.) It also sounds strange, I think, so perhaps it's best to just say ""Language has a part to play in our thinking and doing.""  However, the rest of this statement seems to me to make a stronger point. Perhaps it can be rephrased:  ""Many or perhaps even most of (perhaps all) of problems of thinking, doing, feeling, knowing, learning, communicating can ultimately be traced back to their root cause in language."" I wonder if I would have seen this point were it not for Lakoffs book, which has helped me (and probably many people with whom I've worked) understand the ""language"" that we use in thought and communication."

401,Who Accepts This Card?,Considering this utterance: Who Accepts This Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,".

Intentions:
-The card being played is for one person only. That person is to make sure the intended recipient accepts the card. -The intention is that the person be the bearer of the message (the sender of this card).
If it is a two-word phrase, which of these is most likely the sender?
A - I'm sending this to (name)
B - She/he accepts this. (note: This isn't a complete sentence. It is not complete because it lacks a subject. So the question is, does this make the phrase an incomplete or a non-sentence?) - He/She accepts these. 
I would argue that it's both an imperfect and a sentence so I'd lean towards B. But that's up for discussion. :)
Thanks!
Edit: I should mention that we're using a deck of cards to communicate our ideas, so this is actually a case where a card is intended to be read and used in a single communication act, though I think it'd be pretty obvious that there is only one card per card, but I don't know. This question was meant more for the ""rules and guidelines of communication"" than for a language discussion specifically, as that could easily be a topic for another question/discussion. Just wanted to clarify. Thanks everyone!   ^_^
Answer:  B is correct. I would've said the same thing too if it were phrased as an answer. :P
(Original answer posted below)  A is incorrect, for two reasons: first, it doesn't include enough context to determine who the actual sender is. For example, if the recipient asks for clarification on who's sending it, the only thing that remains is ""I'm."" Second, a is missing the second half of a verb, making it incomplete. B also makes it clear (at least to me), but only in two separate parts, not just a little bit. Therefore it can be answered as being complete. Also, I thought that cards used to deliver messages is an uncommon enough usage, that if an example can't be found in the dictionary, we don’t use it. And I was right in that case. In any event, B would be most common, unless you were playing a game that specifically used A. If you want to"

This is a classic example of an open ended question – it invites you to fill the blanks with your own meaning. This type of phrase can be difficult to translate into another language, as the speaker may not necessarily have thought through the exact meaning you are trying to communicate.
One thing you need to know about open-ended questions is that they need the verb tense to be in the past. You can not use any verb in present perfect tense with any of the other tenses. The question is always past, even if the context does not imply that it is. In this question, the answer is no. 
For example, you would have a more correct translation of ‘Can My card be used everywhere (in the future)?'"

or maybe:  ""Are there rules on where to use your card""?
What can I learn from this phrase? What can it tell me about how my mind works? 
It seems to express curiosity about the answer to a question which makes sense to me. But what is it about this question that causes a response like that? It seems it could be something like this: If I don't get the right answer, then I'll have a hard time trusting my cards.  The rules are that my wife would be upset if I use them. The other possibility is that it's asking if the bank will give you permission to go to these places and use the money on your account to pay.
The way I read this is to ask: How do I apply these rules about where and what to do with my money? My money, is not in any one place. I keep my cash in a different place from my checking account, from other credit and debit cards, I have it in different denominations, some in cash, as cash cards from the store where it was purchased and in my name, and so on. When I ask the question as if to apply them to my current situation, that gives me an idea of how to deal with those things. It gives direction on how I will do my transactions. How I do not understand this, but my sense is you're just curious about it. My sense from your writing that this may be how you feel too. If you ask if you can have the card, or how can you have more, are you asking about your options, if that's even how it works, it is an interesting question to have some fun with. Just for fun, ask your husband and see if he will answer. :)"

The card I gave you to pay for groceries will be accepted at the cash register.
It's more likely the intended meaning is something like this: 
You should take this card with you when you go to the grocery store. I trust you will know where it's accepted.  (or even)
I'll be the one you'll ask if you need help. If the store is closed, I'll take it home or drop it off to you

A:

 A phrase used in reference to a card, where one has no idea which bank it will work at. For instance, you have a Mastercard with an American bank and a Visa with a Canadian bank. You can tell you are in trouble if the card is accepted in both places, because if both accept it then they're both bad."
412,What Places Can I Use My Card?,Considering this utterance: What Places Can I Use My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? In this sentence we have two actions and one object. The action is: use. We have a noun phrase and we need a verb that indicates use of something. In order for use to apply in this case we require use in a sentence. A sentence is usually composed of a subject and a predicate. It is used as an expression of thought so in order to complete this phrase we add a word that expresses the thought to the predicate use with the subject place. This thought can be paraphrased as: I would like to use my card where I can have the best service possible.

The Subject: The first word place is a singular noun so we know that one place will be the object of our verb use, and this is expressed in our sentence as I and I only. As the next word is card and place and card is singular so place must be singular. Because place can not take the plural card we must modify place by using the singular verb can. When we modify with can a person is not the first or the last person we use can and when we include a thing like card the word it can also be used. Now we complete our subject I use I with card can in place where we can enjoy the most excellent service to have card to give us the information and the help that we want when making purchases and to provide the highest quality service.


We now have completed our complete subject. After we write our subjects we next need to state our main verb in the form of an -ing verb. Use is an action verb so use and -s verb, to, with, at, in, upon, after, before, during, or after. So we say we will use our card in places we could enjoy service that exceeds our expectations of any other. Since we used an verb of action use is plural to make it plural and it makes sense that this verb could be use for multiple people. To use card for more than one person would be: we all use credit cards to shop, we go to many many stores and malls when shopping and there we enjoy our service and use cards. If card was used to help us decide where to go we would say: my mom uses her credit card when she shops while my sister uses hers when I shop. There are more words we often add to modify our nouns so that they become active and more"
413,Is My Card Accepted Everywhere?,Considering this utterance: Is My Card Accepted Everywhere? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? A simple answer is: ""I want to check on the location where is this card is accepted"".

But what if you had a longer intent, something you were going to use as the ""search term"" to get a list of things you could use?
Something like: I want a restaurant that accepts my card and that also serves a specific food. How can I get that? 
What if your intent were to have a ""conversational"" interaction? Like: Let's say I had two places I wanted to eat, one on Main Street, a place that serves American food, and one off Main that is a Mexican place. Let me get directions from you to each place and I pick one.
How could we phrase that in a single sentence? It seems like we have to break it into ""intent"" and ""context"". I.e. ""Let me know the directions to Main St. and to the Mexican restaurant. I'm going into town to pick out food.""
I could imagine some sort of a conversational sentence for the simple intent of:
""Give me directions for a route where I can get to a certain restaurant and also get on a freeway, using my gas credit towards the trip."""

[Disclaimer: I'm not a linguist; my knowledge of this area comes only by reading about things from people who are, and the above may contain errors.]
The way I see it, there's this two-dimensional spectrum: on one side we have facts, on the other, opinions. Factual statements are the ones that can be considered universal -- they don't vary from person to person. I could argue that this is also the side where the language-speaking community is likely to be, since we tend to communicate mainly through facts. There's a sort of natural ""I know what I know because I have seen it before"" attitude when dealing with the facts of reality, while there is no way that we can know the future with certainty, nor the past with absolute certainty (but we may have a good reason to think so). And it's the same with things that are subjective, like the value of an art work, or the beauty of nature.   It's all just a matter of subjective perception, as opposed to a statement that could be taken as universally true -- such as, ""it doesn't rain in Spain""; or, to pick a random example, the claim,  ""All men are created equal"".  In this way, we are all free to have opinions -- and, when we use the expression ""that doesn’t rain"", we don‘t claim that ""all men"" cannot be created different; we simply state that it is not our opinion. On the ""opinion"" side of things, everything else seems to fall somewhere between a universal truth and what we call ""personal beliefs"" or ""beliefs about matters of opinion"", for example: ""It”s the best thing I ever ate"". (You might be aware that a lot of religious and political people tend, at least among the believers, towards the truth side on that spectrum.)"
416,What Businesses Accept This Card?,Considering this utterance: What Businesses Accept This Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,":

Business Acceptance of this Card is a great example of the power of a short and to-the-point phrase, to describe a concept clearly and concisely.
The phrase is powerful in its own right, but it also serves as an example for the type of phrase that should be used in your marketing to make it easy for potential customers to understand your business."
417,Where Can I Use My Card?,Considering this utterance: Where Can I Use My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

(A) To request the location of a card office
A simple request. The person is asking the question because the card is lost and she needs the office location to report this fact.
Note: When a person says, ""Can I use my card?"" she wants to know if she can use, or use in, the place where she receives her monthly credit card bills. This is why it is best to include location words with the verb use. It may sound odd, yet is it really? I've used my money card to pay for many things since I received it a year ago and have never been questioned where it's been used or to whom it was used for. If I were asked, I could explain it simply to the cashier: ""May I please use (verb) my credit ____ card? It's expired, and I forgot I'd left it at Home Depot yesterday.""
Another situation where the simple card holder may ask to use is during the time before a trip (or before an extended stay in another city) when it may be inconvenient to carry cash or may require the holder to buy things before she leaves. She will be carrying a credit/debit card, but she may have forgotten to charge her usual monthly fees or, since she has no idea where, when, etc., she will use her card at the destination, she'll say, Can We Use It. Note this phrase is also used to ask permission to withdraw a certain amount of money from a bank and then deposit the money in a different account. So the person saying ""can we use it"" is more often than not, not asking for the use of that card in the first place!
The last place we want it to be used is when we don't want to. For example, we have a large family, each with a separate card. We are all members of the same credit union. My husband wants the kids to have separate cards, which he can't always control.

419,"I Am Traveling To Germany, Will I Be Able To Use My Card There?","Considering this utterance: I Am Traveling To Germany, Will I Be Able To Use My Card There? What is the intent that best describes it?","?

In this example, I’ll use the phrase “to Germany” and the word ”will“ as two candidates.
I‘ll provide a number of explanations for each of their meanings. Then we‚ll try to pick the best fit, which will be the one that you use in a sentence. The answers are not only a word„answer‭. They also contain other parts such as an explanation (what a definition is, what it is used for, how it works, or what the grammar is). All of this will make your life easier if you ever need to talk about the phrases and words, and it will help you get a deeper understanding of how they really sound. All right, it‛s time to start. Let‹s begin...
1. „To› means ’‡ to‬. With this answer, we can state that the first word (‪to ) refers to the verb ‘to go to Germany.‏‮‖It s what a ‚ verb means‌,‍ as well as the most familiar part of speech for most English speakers, so it can often be overlooked‽ As a verb, ‭to"" has 3 different meanings, depending on the circumstances:
a. As its intransitive form, meaning a simple ‪act , e.g. ""He left."" as opposed to ""he ran.""
(The first ‍ verb​ means that one person or animal does an action and another does something in order to do the action.)
b. Its preterite/future-tense form: ""I will go. He will leave the room."" It can also be ‫used‫ as both a ""simple verb"" and a prepositional-adjective. This is also a form of the transitive verb ""to be"" (which we'll talk more about later).
3. Will‥ means ""whether․ "" The first part (""whether"") indicates that there are many different possible options. We can see this by the following example: ""Do we want to go…to the park or the movies"
420,What Stores Will Take My Credit Card As Payment?,Considering this utterance: What Stores Will Take My Credit Card As Payment? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? I would be inclined to say “It is about the store and the credit card.” However, if a listener were to describe it that way, she might be referring to the entire conversation. To be clear, both descriptions are completely correct. It depends on whether the listener is considering a specific moment in time or the total conversation up to that point.

I’ve been thinking about this question lately because it was my birthday last week. My birthday falls in October, the month of Halloween, a time in which many of us are still recovering from our collective post-holiday hangover. That said, I‘m not really a big fan of the holidays in a lot of ways. So when October rolls around, even if it‟s my special month, that just sucks. I think about October for most of August because that“s when school starts. In August, it all starts over again but, by October I start wishing I were still in school again. And when September rolls round, there„ s always a few days around my birth date that are just not my favorite. They aren‛t the only days with that problem, but they are the days when that happens. There‚s an awful lot to dislike about September. October is an especially hard month for me because then I don‪t feel like I got the summertime thing out of my system. The end of summer, you know?
If you‭ read ‭My Book of Lists,‬, then you may recall that, as I was writing ‑ about ‬the ‪best‫‏things‡ you can ‏buy with a credit‖ card , my list included ‐ ” best ‫sales in ‍October‹. „‮ In other ‌places, when I use this phrase, ‮you ‌ might think that the list †is about sales in‍ September or ′May ‹‰ or› ″December. ․  ‰I don't know what to tell you about that.

421,Is There Any Place I Cannot Use My Card?,Considering this utterance: Is There Any Place I Cannot Use My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? I think its ""I am going to use my card""

A:
This is another case of a ""what am I saying here?"" (or as in your case, ""What the heck am i saying!?"")
It comes from a time in our history/culture when people did not use/have access to a credit card. It was the sole method of purchasing goods without cash (which was a major problem before credit/debit cards came along.)
The intent here is one of surprise. There is a certain amount of ""puzzlement"" that comes out with the way it ends with ""place"".
As an example of another phrase, consider: Are you sure you don't want to go? The meaning is ""Are you completely sure?"" or more literally,  ""You don’t want?"""
422,Will I Be Able To Use My Card Anywhere?,Considering this utterance: Will I Be Able To Use My Card Anywhere? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

There are two possible meanings that are likely to come to mind, but there are also other ways to express the idea.
The first idea that pops into mind is will I be able to use my card anywhere. It is not clear how one would go from that to using a card. One could take that literally and use a form of the verb 'use'.
I can use the card, I can also use (the card). In the first sentence, one is referring to the use of some physical item (such as card), whereas, in the second one, the person in question is using an object (e.g. the object is a word).
However, there is also the notion of 'be able' which could be read in a similar way. This is how it is usually read when the question 'will I?' is asked. So, will (i.e., the subject of will) I I will be Able to? (to use) the (card). This would make little sense, at least from what I hear.  I cannot be Able to because, to me, it sounds that the speaker/writer is asking if he/she will have the ability to. To use, on the other hand, is to perform an action to make use or put forth an effort to do something. A good example would be that of a writer putting out effort and then writing a book. He/She will use this book in his/her next life. The writer cannot use it in this life, because he cannot write in that life (or at that time). I think there would have been another way for the writer to have expressed this thought. Instead of using will, would, or be, a much clearer way would've been: will the book be used/used in my next book? This question would still be vague, and the answers could vary on a case by case basis. For that reason, 'Will I' and 'am I able?' should be the only two options. In all likelihood, he is able, however, if the context is clear, people can infer that he was referring more to his ability than the item in hand. 'Can you use your card?'
A more recent example of it being used is Will/am The (current season) XXXXXX win the championship"
423,Is My Card Usable Anywhere?,Considering this utterance: Is My Card Usable Anywhere? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A.   I do not care where my card is used.
B. I care more where I use my credit card than that it is usable at that store, because I might be carrying the card I am using to pay for something at a store that sells a competitor’s products or services. (Note: This is actually a bad idea, but I”m using an example)
C. If it“s not a risk at your store (because, for instance, you are an authorized buyer from that vendor), this is ok – no risks, no worries, just use it as you like. You may not use that card at other vendors, though. So, the answer is A. But I don‘t care if it gets use on the street or used to buy a new car.


The answer you gave is B, even though what you‡›re really asking is “does my Visa card work anywhere?‖ The answer to that question doesn‚€t matter to you, only the question at hand. To put it another way, ‘A‰ is not the same as ‡ B.‬ But it will still have the exact same meaning. It means ‚°I don „t pay close attention to where a card might or might not be usable. †ª That doesn ’t answer your question, and you know it. As you pointed out, it can be a very big risk if you buy something with stolen card (a risk that is only real if the retailer allows you to use any other form of payment.) You have two other questions, one that should be answered by ‗A and the other that can answer by both ”°A ‬or ‹ B ′
Your first question is why is it a problem if my Card„€s usable anywhere. Your second is if I could just go shopping and use a Card. Let‟s answer those by answering the questions in turn:
1. Why Is It A Problem? - Your first reason was simply ‰A: ‴․ I ‱ don ƒ‹t  care ‪ where it  ¤ is    used

424,Is It Acceptable To Use My Card Anywhere?,Considering this utterance: Is It Acceptable To Use My Card Anywhere? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The best I came up with is to “explicitly state” a goal for the transaction. In this regard (and I’m basing these thoughts and ideas based on some of my experience as an accountant for over 30 years and from my personal life as well) I find it‘s helpful to have a plan in mind. This plan should be explicit and focused. For example, I could have said that it was part of an audit or a review, or even just a statement of where my business and finances were headed.
In terms of the specific example I was discussing, the goal was to find the balance in my checkbook. I didn‚Äôt know where that balance was, and I wanted to know, so we planned the trip and my wife and son were along for a bit of a ride and as we rode the bikes we reviewed how we were doing. We also looked at my finances, which were going to change, as my company had recently acquired a company that had a great deal of accounts receivable. The plan was that I would be able to review what had been happening, what the balances were, etc. It wasn„Åthe plan“ that the accountant would find out why I had not been able, in a timely manner, to pay all of these receivables, but that we could go and find a solution that would make the situation right, if possible. (It is, of course, always possible to make things right. )

425,Can I Use My Card Everywhere?,Considering this utterance: Can I Use My Card Everywhere? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

This sentence has a complex meaning, but can be analyzed as two simple phrases: 
a) Can: This is a simple declarative sentence. Its predicate (a modal expression ""can"") is an adjective (in this case, the copula in the infinitive is used, and it is not an inflectional form), but it describes a noun (i.e., the thing I want to talk to you about).   This part of the sentence can also be used as the main clause for a declarativus: ""I want can you to..."" (I can ask you). This kind of sentence uses the same form as ""Can you...?"" (which is one word). ""Do you want, can I?"" is another example of this.  In this sentence it can either be a yes or no question; in any case the answer is yes.
b) You and Everywhere: the second part describes the scope of your use of a card, i. e. not every place. It can even be interpreted as if you wanted to say ""everywhere"" at the very end of ""you and everywhere"": ""You can always use your card... anywhere.""
The full sentence is then:
""You're right... I'd like can use my card anywhere""
As you can see, it's not a very formal sentence at all but the meaning is quite clear."
426,Where Is My Card Accepted?,Considering this utterance: Where Is My Card Accepted? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

Is the phrase an adverb, verb, or adjective, as in:

428,Where Should My Card Work?,Considering this utterance: Where Should My Card Work? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A) To get the answer: I'll ask my bank.B) My bank will tell me where my car card works.C) The bank tells me the car has a card.
I'm not sure, but from the wording, it appears that option (B): My Bank Will Tell me Where My Car Has A Card; is most accurate. My reason for thinking option A is a better choice than (C): The Bank Tells me, is option B is that it is an incomplete sentence, and therefore option C is grammatically incorrect? The way that the question is posed, makes option D) the correct answer, Where's your car? (D)
If the word Where is used in another context such as Where does my card fit?, I would expect A, B, or D to fit the context as well since the Where should be considered to be a part of the other sentence. Therefore, if Where can be used as an answer for Where Does My Credit Card Go When I Leave My Office, then I agree with the choices A) to get an idea of where you can use your card and B) where to keep your key."

431,Can I Make Online Purchases With My Card?,Considering this utterance: Can I Make Online Purchases With My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? What do I want to do? To purchase something online for myself? With my card? The answer to each question is: Yes, I can make online purchases with My card. And, that is what you are interested in learning about because you will be using that information.

This page and its articles will present you with the information needed to learn about how to make an online purchase with a card, using a credit card that you have, or using your debit card at a store that offers card-based purchase services. The information in it includes: What you need to know, How you can learn it, Where to find the needed information, What to expect if you try it out. As part of learning to use your card for purchases, the page also includes this: If you do not currently use a payment method for making purchases on the Internet, you might be asking yourself, what is a Payment Method and, does this method work on The Internet?
I
t seems like the first step that I should take is to explain what a
Payment Method for online credit and debit purchases is. If we consider
this utterances: The payment for my purchases should be done with my
credit card (What? Is that what I need explained?), It's time to pay for
those purchases (Which purchases?), You need more credit (The meaning? You have more money for a purchase.), and You should have a lot of money tomorrow (A lot, in reference to money, sounds like a need.), these all mean the same thing. There is only one answer that they all could be trying to be saying: You will use money from money. That means that we have arrived at an explanation about a very simple part. It takes a short time for people to get used to the concept of credit. For most people it is difficult to think of a time when a cash purchase was made in an economy of not only using money but, having a supply of it. People who have not yet accepted credit cards use cash for purchasing, but that fact is changing as it becomes part and parcel of how they conduct their day to day business. To be able to understand credit, it helps a person to have some understanding of the money supply that exists in the United States or any other country where this concept also exists.

432,Does Every Place Of Business Accept This Card?,Considering this utterance: Does Every Place Of Business Accept This Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"or phrases in a sentence?

For the purpose of this question, a place of business includes such places as the following:
a retail store;
an individual’s personal office in their home; and
the place in which the individual works in an organization.
I believe that every place where an individual accepts payment for their services will accept this card. I would use the phrase “every place” in place for ” accepts this … card“. However, in this case I may be over analyzing this. The question may have a different intent in mind.  
What are the pros and cons regarding this usage?  How is this phrase commonly used? I am looking to gain more insight on the usage here. It could be that the question is trying to find the ‘best‘ usage for a particular case. So this is not to say that this „every place‰‹will‮accept this›,„card‬‥.‖‏ could not be used. As in any other context the meaning should be taken from the context. But what is your interpretation or opinion on this? If you do not understand my question and are not going to answer it anyway, that is okay. Please explain where in English or in context this would be most commonly understood as an idiomatic phrase meaning: ’accepts this...‟  I guess I should reword my request for clarity. In a situation where payment would have to occur within the scope of being in business as defined above, would you then say, ‛Every place... accepts... card... ‹? or ‚No place … accepts … this… card?‛ or something else? Again I hope you will help me get my mind and heart around this in order to help my writing. Again, thank you for reading this and for taking the time to reply or for just being patient with me until I can make more sense of how to phrase this for you. My goal is to learn more about English, and not just the writing for English. Thanks again,

What I'm not sure about is that is this sentence gramatically correct?"
434,Can I Use My Card Anywere?,Considering this utterance: Can I Use My Card Anywere? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

(1) The card is for my use only.
I can use it to buy goods or services or I can buy it, but I cannot use the card to pay anything for someone else. For example, I could give my card at a store and purchase groceries but would be unable to purchase things with the use of the credit card. In the case of this example phrase, the person using the phrase would likely be someone who uses her credit to fund her entire budget. (The same would apply if this phrase was used to express a desire to use or to make a reservation, or any other desire or intent which would use one's credit.)
This is usually the strongest way of expressing that intent. When I use this sentence, people usually know exactly what I mean. However they sometimes do not. So, sometimes, in order to be completely confident that the listener is getting what is intended, a speaker will add a clarification:
""Can I..."" ""Can't I..."" ""I Can..."" etc. -- these add emphasis and clarify exactly how the speaker intends to or wants to do the intended activity. They are also the usual phrases with which one might add such a clarifying statement to the end of an answer to a question: ""Do I have anything to say about this?"" or ""Is that all?""
If this person is not a native English speaker, there's nothing wrong with adding the clarification because they are using their own language which allows one to clarify with a simple word or phrase. It will be obvious from the intonation which is meant and no additional words are needed. But in a written message, such as when responding to an email, we cannot be certain that this is what the other speaker intended and so a clear word to ensure it will usually do. Also, even a person who speaks the language fluently can find it awkward to write the word. I remember a colleague writing: 
Can it be used for any reason? It was in an e-mail I received from an unknown person. He was asking if it could be ""used"" for anything. If the question was: Does it work anywhere? The answer is yes, and the sentence would end with can't be."
435,Will Any Business Take This Card?,Considering this utterance: Will Any Business Take This Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

Intent
Actions are performed for a purpose or with a belief in a goal or end result.
The word intent is a legal term that describes the state of mind of the actor. It is used in the legal definition of criminal actions. In law enforcement the term is defined as ""the mental state encompassing both the purpose for which a person acts and the resulting state that is affected by that act.""
For instance, if a thief is robbing and shoots a victim, this indicates that he was intending to steal and to harm. Intent is different from purpose. The thief may have a reason to rob the victim that differs from his intent. That reason might be to use force or to cause fear in order to gain control of property. He may use intimidation or trickery to accomplish his purpose of stealing. Therefore, his reason and intent may be separate, but the intention is to perform the act of robbing. Intention is not just mental; it involves physical activity, such as reaching for an object as the thief's finger touches the trigger of a gun. As a general explanation, it is useful to note that intention and action are not the same. For example, intention to do harm and actual causing of harm are two entirely different things. If someone tells an adult that someone else is going to shoot another child, the adult will probably try to prevent him from hurting the child. But the person who actually fires the gun might not have any intention of harming the other child; if the shooting happens to have been accidental. There are a number of possible reasons why a criminal might shoot a child other than the ""purpose"" of injuring him. An example is in this case is that the criminal accidentally pulled and cocked a weapon in which it was loaded. Another example of an accidental shooting is when a law-abiding firearm owner attempts to protect his own family or another family at an unusual distance from him by accident when handling his weapon. A third example would involve someone who accidentally fires a bullet into a tree. None of these would indicate criminal intent for the shooter, because intent or criminal purpose is usually inferred from actions, not from thoughts, unless an admission to the police is recorded. This type of intent, which is sometimes called general intent (although the meaning does not include mental elements), requires no specific mental component. Thus, a burglar could have an intent to break"
436,Will Filling Stations Accept My Card?,Considering this utterance: Will Filling Stations Accept My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Is it a rhetorical question?

A:
[A]nswering the question with “Yes”
is an indication [that] the speaker [does] not really expect the listener(s) to answer in the affirmative
to the implied question.
Example from Wikipedia
In the United States context, the phrase can also be a common way for speakers, especially teenagers,
when asking a stranger for directions, to ask if the stranger is willing [to give them directions] (also see: ‘Are you willing to help me?’)
The speaker usually assumes that the response is ”No, I‘m a very good driver and don‟t need your assistance in that case.“
Note: the common use of this phrase in an ambiguous situation
and the assumption that people usually assume negative responses indicate both the use in sarcasm
(in situations where people are supposed to respond truthfully) and the fact that it is not clear
for the asker if a response should be positive or negative. The question of intent is important in determining sarcasim, sarcomania or sarcophagia;
some people think sarcass is when you mean to be sarcastic, some that sarcasms are unintended, and some even think the opposite. 
An alternative interpretation, as the OED has it, is that „I would not like to say what I was about to, if I didn‚t already know. I don't think one could say something
with less force than when he says ‚I don''t know',„ or ‹I won't say it›. (1911)"
437,Do I Have To Verify My Identity?,Considering this utterance: Do I Have To Verify My Identity? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?:

1) Do we need identification before we can use the facility? (yes, we may need to verify an identity to use it, e.g., to buy gasoline)
2) Can I use this facility without being identified?
3) Will someone try and use my identity when I give my access to the service? Or:
4) Is it safe for me to provide my identification to this person (e.G. do people ever lie to security guards or do they have the correct identity)?
And of course, there's the more subtle variations of this question: ""How do I access the parking garage?"" (1 or 4), ""Can I go in?""/""can I pass?""(1), etc.
Is it correct to say that this is more of a grammar than a semantics question, although semantics is obviously a part of it? I'm also curious about how it is classified, in both language and logic: a pragmatics/semantics question versus grammar. And of corse, I'd also be curious to know if there are any linguistics/logic terms that can be applied to it. I couldn't think how to search this. Thanks!
I'll probably try searching this using a few different approaches, but I would appreciate it if you could suggest a way that I might be able to narrow it down better. 
Update: I didn't originally notice there was an ""e"" at the end of the sentence in the link below. However, this doesn't make much sense in this context. The link is to a post on this website from 2013. But I think the question is still valid for the same reason in a similar context for example: What does the following mean? If you have not verified your identity before using [something]? In both cases, the user is using or referring to an action that requires him to identify himself. So I believe this can still be regarded as the original version of my question. That being said, please feel free to close the post with the additional link as needed. In the past few days, a new answer has been put in, which seems to deal more with semantics, and less with grammar, as I originally thought, so I'll leave it open for now. If anybody has something more to add, feel welcome to do so. For now,"
438,Why Do You Need To Know So Much About Me,Considering this utterance: Why Do You Need To Know So Much About Me What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I've been thinking about it, and I think that this kind of question might be more of an example of a style of expression rather than a question. It seems to me that I have already answered the question, by the very phrase: ""Why do you need to know so much about me?""
It seems that the real question here may be: What do I want to do/get, or what do other people who know me think I will want, get etc? Or is it a rhetorical question - the phrase is not asking a real ""question"" but instead expressing the speaker's own intent.
(I know this could be rephrased in a number of ways - but I'm not looking for specific answers - merely trying to figure out the meaning of the expression)
EDIT - I just realized that a better phrase might have been phrased as: Do you have so many questions about yourself? The answer to that question would depend on the tone, body language etc. of how the statement was given. So the true intent of this might not have ever been answered. The other phrase I came up with is - Do I look that much like a criminal? That would be funny, though. If I am a crime in the eyes of that person, then that is exactly how they ""see me.""
In either case, the reason I asked was because I wanted to see how a friend would answer a person who was asking why she has so few friends, in what could seem to some to be an accusatory tone. I was curious if her tone could possibly make a difference in their answer, because the phrasing of:
Why Do [Insert Person Here] Need to Know so Much about Me? 
would seem pretty accusatorial to a lot of people, but if they could see that she was just being a bit of ""silly"" that it would not affect their response.   They may even have answered in such a way that showed her how much she does ""need to [know] so [much] about [her]self."" I thought this example here was relevant because of what I observed - which was not at all what was intended. My goal, instead, was to try to understand the ""intent"" of asking that kind question that has come up in other discussions. But that was really not what"

440,I Cannot Verify My Identity,Considering this utterance: I Cannot Verify My Identity What is the intent that best describes it?,"? (1) (a) Verifies that identity; (b) Shows the state of identity. (2) Can verify my identity?

Answers
1.(a): To show that there is no certainty for his belief.
(b): It is used in the same manner of the sentence ""There is a chance that he will return to the United States.""
There are two questions:
Q.: Can you verify your identity,
A.: Yes, I can prove my existence.Q. Can I verify you identity
.A. If you can verify then you have verified yourself. Q. I cannot verify. A. Yes. Because you cannot prove that you are existent, because of your belief that ""I do not exist"". So you say that I am not existed."
441,I Do Not Have What Is Required To Prove My Identity,Considering this utterance: I Do Not Have What Is Required To Prove My Identity What is the intent that best describes it?,"? (A) I have what is necessary to prove my identity. (B) No I do not have the required proof.

In other words, if A is correct, the meaning of ""I do... X"" would not indicate the existence of that object. Instead, I would like B to indicate that there exists a condition in which it's impossible for someone to present something to a judge which is a valid proof of their identity and, therefore, that something should be said, e.g., ""You have my word.""
A better sentence would be the equivalent of the statement (C) There is no proof (of identity) because I DO NOT have it. The speaker's intent is clear, but this cannot be expressed in two-word phrases in English."
442,Why Doesn'T The App Believe I Am Who I Say I Am?,Considering this utterance: Why Doesn'T The App Believe I Am Who I Say I Am? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

Intent is a psychological term. It has nothing to do with the actual meaning of the word.
So in the question: I am a teacher, I intend you to understand: why doesn't the app believe that? is this the intended meaning? or something else?"
443,I Am Having Trouble Verifying My Identity.,Considering this utterance: I Am Having Trouble Verifying My Identity. What is the intent that best describes it?,"in English?

I'd say it's ""I am having trouble verifying my identity."" The verb here is ""Verifying,"" a verb meaning ""to discover something or to prove something to someone.""
A common phrasing is: ""Having trouble... Verification."" 
Example:
""Verification is one thing that is always a good idea."" -- Bill Gates"
444,What Do I Do If My Verification Failed,Considering this utterance: What Do I Do If My Verification Failed What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I'd guess a couple of possibilities, but they'd have different consequences:
(1) I'll have to fix this by hand.
The most probable meaning here is that you'll need to hand-tweak your code in order to avoid your application falling over, in this particular corner case, and you don't want any unnecessary changes to what you consider to be clean, well-written code. I'd say ""This is a bad bug, please fix it"", or ""I'm going to add a little extra code just to prevent this from happening, so donno if it should or not"".
If you're using your own language, of course, this is going have consequences; you can't just make a tiny change and be confident of the results, if you know your language well enough to write an ""automatically fixable"" bug like this. But you still have the choice to change things, even if they're not ""clean code""
That's not something you should expect any client to do, though; when a client is paying you for writing code for their project, there's a good chance they can afford to spend time on making sure you won't hit this corner-case. It's also very likely to happen once, or twice: either a particular bug was already fixed, either it's so easy to hit that it was fixed at the same time for all bugs. If you do expect this to need fixing manually though, it may be useful to have some tests that fail in the corner where this bug is hit, for instance. And if that test passes on other platforms, you might ask the client for time to test your fix on their platform. This is something that should be a responsibility of a tester (or a QA-specialist), but it might be easier to get client buy-in by explaining that the bug will happen rarely, that they'll just spend less time debugging it if the fix works as expected. They'll also probably appreciate being able to point out the next bug they want fixed when they see it. (The only other time they will know which corner cases you are responsible for is when the problem manifests in-place in real code, which is what I would actually do.)
You should still be prepared for (1), even when client asks you to code this way, because"
445,It Is Impossible To Verify My Identity,Considering this utterance: It Is Impossible To Verify My Identity What is the intent that best describes it?,"? If you chose ‘Impossible’ you have a strong bias because you don‘t think it is possible to be verified. A strong possibility is that you‒and we as well if we do not understand and believe in our identity―are looking for reasons why our identities, our existence and our being could not be proven or verified and are looking at identity from a logical perspective that is not at play here. Our logical mind is looking to validate identities or prove them as fact. That is what we are doing because there is a part of our brains that cannot accept the non-sense that our senses are producing.

In this context, the phrase “it is impossible to verify my identity” has a different meaning. We know who we think we really are, but our physical senses cannot verify it. The physical can verify our external body that we have and use on a given day. It cannot identify us as one specific unique individual. For instance, my mother and my son could be standing next to me and could verify I am the same physical mother of the child standing beside it, and the son standing in a few years would have to say the kid is his father. If the physical could identify me, it does not. To the eyes of that physical sense, there are two persons. There are the body and mind of an individual and that sense does know how to read our minds and know that the mind knows who it thinks it really is or is. But the brain or body is incapable of knowing itself, its own past, history and future, unless it can read its mind. Minds cannot be read, mind reading cannot exist in an external sense because the senses of mind and matter cannot read each other. They cannot communicate directly. So, we can say that it cannot prove who I really am. I think about that fact and find that most people think there must be identity because we cannot see ourselves but we know we exist. This is how we live our lives. When we find a person that can identify who they think they are―or they believe they can be―they get to live their life, not us because they have no knowledge of who is they really think and cannot understand that they cannot know what they will be in the future and they would like to. Yet, they know, or can feel in their mind that who their"
446,The App Doesn'T Know It'S Me.,Considering this utterance: The App Doesn'T Know It'S Me. What is the intent that best describes it?,"(i.e. not a complete multi-word sentence) and why?

(a) ""I am not my phone"".
I'd say ""The App doesn't know it's me because the App is a phone."" Or ""the App isn't aware it is me""
Or even ""my phone is my App"" or ""it isn' t my app.""
But in my experience, these are usually too literal and don't really get to the point you want to get across.
What you really want is:
""I know the world. I am aware of what I see, what others see me, where I was born, when I began, and where my end is. My phone, however, does not know that. The app does know my number but not who I, or anything else about me. But the app is not aware that it does or doesn't know me or who it knows me as."" 
So my point is, this is what you need to do:   describe your app's knowledge of you, in one sentence and then explain why you are saying this.  (Or why your character would say this.)
Also, if your App ""knows"" who you (as an agent) are and the phone doesn""t, that is confusing. So you probably want the opposite. In other words, tell the reader/listener the ""other side"" knows who or what they are or is thinking about (but the narrator doesn;t)"

And how does this change in the following context:

I'VE HAD TROUBLE VERIFYING MY ID. - I know that you're not who you say. 
OR:  I've had trouble verifying my ID..
   OR: Have you had a chance to verify my id?  (This sounds a little odd)
AND: The person who was helping me (the person that I'm trying to find) did not verify this person. So, it is possible that my name was used by someone for identity purposes..  This may be my fault for allowing someone access to my account.. But I have to ask the question whether the person actually exists and if not, how did the ID come about.. OR, If you can verify that the information is correct and I need to know the result? OR. If the info is invalid, can you tell me why?.. AND. I would like to hear any suggestions that can improve my chances of finding the correct person.. I just want to make sure that someone is who they say they are.. and that they actually exist before I provide any type of info regarding my situation. (I may provide a phone number, email id or some type that could be traced.. so I'd be very careful about that)  Thanks in advance for the help.. Please let me know if you have any questions..

What is more interesting, is how this question is not asked for a dictionary. It is a question that could have been asked and answered for every language and in every society at all times in the history of the world.
This is exactly the way we need to think about this new world of ours where the rules and language change rapidly as we move further and further from the time when the great human migrations began. When we ask questions like these about the modern world we are trying to build, this is what we should be talking about, not what can we find in a single dictionary? How could anyone have expected that the answer to such a broad and important question would reside in one book? This is why I have created the Dictionary of American English. I believe this work is essential for our time. We can find answers to questions about language, about ourselves, and about life in general through this book, but nowhere else. Our ancestors did not have a book like this, there was no reason to have one. They would have found their answers through experience and by talking to each other and this would be true for those who came later and for us and our descendants. This work does not replace any books or other learning but it is part of everything else that we do and the answers it gives us are a part that makes what other people learned more relevant to our lives. If we learn more about something, then we can see how to do it more properly than the last generations did. The Dictionary is that part and so it was made."

This is one of those grammar questions I’m not sure how to solve without a lot of research. I can only guess, I don‘t have much confidence in the answer.

There was a time when the only way to share pictures was to either send a fax to someone who would print and mail a hard copy of your image; or email it to a friend, and hope they actually printed it and mailed it. Then came the introduction of the internet and the ability to send emails that looked just like they had come from your friends, but instead of having them printed out in an envelope, they would pop up on their computer, allowing for a new type of communication. This new technology soon became a standard in daily lives of nearly every person, with people constantly trying to come up with new ways to communicate more efficiently and effectively with each other. Now, there‚??s a much faster and easier way for people to exchange pictures and communicate to one another. One easy way is by using a photo-messaging service. If you have ever taken a picture on your mobile phone or digital camera, chances are you used a mobile messaging service called iMessage. It‟s an extremely user-friendly mobile service that allows users to instantly share photo“messages” with their friends and family through their mobile phones. There is now a similar service on the web called Skype. However, unlike iMessages, Skype is only available at the desktop browser (PC and Mac), so you can„¬¢t easily use your phone to create a message to be shared with your family. Another thing to consider is that, while photo messaging services are great for personal, quick messages back and forth, the main issue is they aren‣t able to store your pictures. What if you wanted to save the ones you took on vacation, or you‫¢ªre in a family photo shoot, in your own picture album on Facebook or your MySpace page? There‬¦s only one way you could do this…
If you want quick access anywhere, use Skype on a laptop or desktop computer. With Skype, you only need an internet connection. You can use it on any platform or device that runs a browser and a Skype client, including Windows, Mac, iOS, Android and Linux"

453,I Am Not Being Recognized By The App.,Considering this utterance: I Am Not Being Recognized By The App. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

This is a very interesting question that was posed a couple weeks ago at the International Society of Psychoanalytic Aesthetics (ISPA) meeting in San Luis Obispo, CA.
If you are not familiar with ISPA, it is very similar to APA in terms of its mission and the fact that it hosts an annual meeting. There are a total of about 350 people that attend the meeting which is hosted by the San Francisco Center for Psychoanalysis, the largest of the three centers for the California Association of Psychoanalysts (CALAPRO). The ISA and APS meetings have a smaller attendance than CALAPROS meetings, however, and are more focused on the theoretical concerns of psychoanalysis rather than the clinical. The attendees are predominantly European psychoanalyst practitioners who are affiliated or trained with their respective psychotherapy/psychoanalytic organizations. This is not at all to denigrate the quality of ISSPA meetings. On the contrary, they are highly rigorous in their review of work. But, as I was told, ISAS are much more interested in theory and philosophy, whereas CALAPS are very concerned with the development of their members and their clients. I suspect that, given the difference in size between ISAP and CALSPA, many of our members are part of more than one organization. Some even have dual affiliation with both the Association for Psychotherapist and American Psychotherapy, APSA and ISSA. However, my point is that ISAPS, like CALCAPS, are different psychocan bodies, with very different cultures, perspectives, values and interests. One is based in the US and another in Europe. Both are concerned to promote the work of psychologists who have come to terms with psycho analysis and its theoretical underpinnings. It is for this reason, perhaps, that I am so intrigued by this question you posed to me. In my mind, there are 3 possible answers. Let me start with a question: Is the answer dependent upon an interpretation? What does your understanding say about the person who said it? Let’s use an example:
In my analysis, a man once stated that his family was “too involved.” He did not explain why he said that. What did his words mean to him? Did the phrase serve to express his discontent? Was he trying to blame"

...and the other was:
""I am trying to find the user who is logged in but cannot login to their
account"". The first would be the most correct, because it is an action of
the same verb as the statement and the subject is clearly stated. The
second seems more like someone is trying not to let something happen or
something else happen which is not a valid answer. This seems as if the
person is asking what to do instead. However, that's just my opinion and
I think it's up to you to decide what you think is most appropriate. So
if you know of any examples I would love to know. If not, I guess you
can choose your answer and I'll vote according to that. :)
Good luck, and have fun. :D

456,I Am Having Trouble Proving My Identity.,Considering this utterance: I Am Having Trouble Proving My Identity. What is the intent that best describes it?,"or a sentence or more?

A:
The answer depends upon how the phrase is used, and upon the meaning of ""prove.""  If this is in an academic context, then the person would want to understand the difference between the proof and the evidence.  In that case, to ""proof"" is to provide evidence supporting the proposition. The ""I"" could be an ""e"" or an ""-er"" as in ""a-mer.""
If the ""trouble"" part refers to the difficulty, rather than the process in which the identity is being established, ""having trouble proving"" might mean being in trouble because it is difficult to identify the individual.
In the context that you mention, an assertion such as,
""I'm just having trouble identifying my parents""
means that the speaker wishes to have his/her parents identified."
457,I Cannot Prove My Own Identity.,Considering this utterance: I Cannot Prove My Own Identity. What is the intent that best describes it?,". I believe it is: to prove that one cannot prove one identity and that all humans are capable of proving their own identity.

What are the most significant things the person who uttered this phrase is trying to tell us?
A. It takes more effort to show us we are not the same than it takes to demonstrate we each are.B. What we think we know is all we ever really know about us.C. Humans have the capability to know themselves.D. Human beings have a right to freedom of identity, of choice in how they define themselves and others.E. To know and to claim the right of freedom in the identity that we claim.F. We are all different, even if we share some physical qualities.G. The world is a different place than we may have thought it was.H. Some of us are more than the sum of our parts.I. All of the answers are right.J. No one is free to define anyone as anything they want.K. A person can tell you who they are and how to recognize them, but a person cannot claim their identity is different.L. If you do not know how your own mind works you cannot know what is true, good or real.M. Our choices, not our limitations, define what we consider ourselves to be.N. This phrase, and our lives, are about to change.O. My life is my own.P. People do this to themselves all the time.Q. There are two sides to everything in life.R. You have to do more work before you can claim you have proven your identity than to try to explain what you already understand.S. When you look for truth it has to look back at you.T.

458,My Id Won'T Be Verified!,Considering this utterance: My Id Won'T Be Verified! What is the intent that best describes it?,"in the English language?

A:
The idiom is to mean that you would not, or will not comply to some request. The implication is that the person making the request is a government official. 
As a native American English speaker, and a linguist, I can say that if you were to ask me to check your id and I were asked to verify it then yes my Id will be verified by me, meaning that I would comply. It would be equivalent to ""Check your ID, sir.""
In order for me verify your Id there must be some form of ID which I have to look at. In the case of government issued ID's it would require a passport, driver license, birth certificate etc. If I verify the id of someone I do so when they hand me the ID to inspect.
It is common to say ""Verify my id please"" in situations where one would expect to show proof to gain entry into a venue or something similar. There is little reason to think that a restaurant or nightclub owner will ask you to perform verification. They would simply want to know if your legal to be there."

460,I Can'T Verify My Identity.,Considering this utterance: I Can'T Verify My Identity. What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Is there a more succinct, and accurate phrase that conveys the same intent or at least a similar intent?

A:
–
This phrase has three meanings. It: 1. indicates that you are not a citizen; 2. that your identity has been stolen or that something has happened to your identification card; 3. (less frequently used) it expresses your frustration with having an identity or an address for some reason.
It's a bit difficult to get any one meaning to be the dominant one. But I think ""can't verify"" and ""identity theft"" (as used colloquially) are two different meanings for the phrase ""I can't confirm it.""
""Can't"" implies a denial; ""cannot"" is more likely than ""could"" for that meaning, but I'm not sure that's always true. I've heard the idiom ""beyond my pay grade"" used for ""don't have authority."" That's not at all the sense you're thinking of, though."
461,The App Doesn'T Recognize Me.,Considering this utterance: The App Doesn'T Recognize Me. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
In a sentence, the most important word is always the verb, and this is even true if you have a single word in front of it. When a word ends in an “n” sound, you put that ‘n''' in the ”t“ of the tenses of verbs.
This is how it looks: You, go to. This is what we call a modality word. The verb ‹go› in this sentence is a ’„regular‘ verb as it has no auxiliary verb (’must‛, ‚could‚ or ‛would‟), and it is in present tense, which is why it ends with an infinitive (go, to) with the same ending. It is one of two verbs ′go′ and ‵‴go´, but „go″ is more common. Other regular verbs can have any infinitives. 
You and I go. You can go or I can‹´go`. It all depends on the context and the way it sounds for both you and me. We are both doing something and that –‥something‌– is called a purpose. ‬
I was going,‬ and‏ he ‮came . I was going to, when he got up and walked. These are not the main verb and purpose, so they don ...
The word 'tenses' is part of an adjective, part verb. That adjective is ""regular"", like ""going"".  It is‧
the‭ ‰‡present ( ‱going ‰),‪and ‏it‣ is‖in, or‎‗… ‧.‽It ′‷is: a† present, a past (when he was gone) and a future."

A. I am having difficulties to verify my identity B. Verify my Identity I C. The identity Verification D. Difficulitie to Veri ficate my Identit E. Identity Verifiction F. Verify my Iden tity

In all the following, replace “identity” with ‘the problem’: The problem can‘t be solved. To understand the problem, it‟s helpful to look at what makes the identity process work. So, consider the situation of a group of people who have been kidnapped by another group, and all are being held for ransom. You have to work with a small number of hostages. But each of the prisoners, in his or her own way, has a lot of information that would help you free them: information about the location of some important facilities or the layout of surrounding terrain. Some of you will be able to communicate with some of these people through telephone lines – others won„t. Your job is to find out which information is relevant and which isn“t, then organize the hostages to maximize the amount of that information you can get. There have already been many attempts on your part to get this information, but you have had no success. One thing you know for sure about this group is that one of them is smarter than you are. As you look around, you notice that every one has his own „style‰ – or lack of style.
(a) What are some ways the intelligence of each hostage can distinguish him from another? (b) Now you must use a team of four, working as efficiently as you possibly can. For each member, identify one important style of intelligence that will make the group work together. (c) If this team fails to reach the target within a period of time that is a function of your abilities, how should the plan of action change?
A. Each hostage has an unique identity. When he is being interviewed by you, his thoughts, beliefs, etc., help in finding the information he knows. B. There are four styles of Intelligence that can be used to identify each person. First is his physical appearance. Second is something he says to the interviewer about his background or his feelings (or lack thereof). Third is what he doesn‹t"
463,The App Doesn'T Believe That I Am Me,Considering this utterance: The App Doesn'T Believe That I Am Me What is the intent that best describes it?,"? What does the sentence say to the user of this app?

I think the App wants you to be able to find your way home. I don't think it's just saying it knows where you are; I think that's implied by the word home in the app's name. In other words, I suspect the application is trying to tell you that it was built to help.

A:
You ask what the best description of that utterances is? Well, here is one that I have heard in my own life that has always struck me as funny (and I would love to know if its true, but haven't been able to track it down yet).

Intent Is The Key.
The most important part of the whole thing. It is what drives the engine, and if you’re not getting it right, the rest is all smoke and mirrors – and not much fun. Intent is how your customers think and behave. And you cannot change what your customer‘s intent is unless you know what it is, right? Intent isn”t something you come up with on your own, it“s how someone else thinks or behaves and you can„t change it if they‟re wrong. You need to know their intent to change their behavior. We do it with all our marketing, but we need help in understanding our customer intent. That‛s what marketing is – getting your attention so you do what you need, want, desire to do. If you don‚t know this then you will never be able to figure out what they want or if your product or service is actually valuable to them. This is why knowing your audience and your market is so important, this is where your intent comes into play. For your specific intent, we‡ll cover this in-depth in a later lesson. But for a general purpose, just ask yourself how would I be thinking or behaving right now if I was a person? If we knew this, then we could make sure we are doing something that aligns with it. Here‹s a couple of questions to ask to help put you in the right direction. How would a typical customer be interacting with your service? How is that customer thinking right this minute? What would you expect from the customer if the service delivered the results they wanted? Here are another couple: How important is this service to the person and why? Is the need urgent for this customer? Can this situation be improved with this person or the product? The intent you pick should be what is important in answering this question. A good example is a car mechanic. The answer of how they would think or behave would probably be how urgent it was for them to get the problem fixed. Knowing the importance of their service would likely be based on the value of car, time spent in traffic, if their car had a problem etc. These questions help define how a customer would be using your services right away. Once you understand this you are in great position to"

The Intention: My intention to say the opposite of this.

467,How Do I Show This Stupid System That This Is Really My Identity?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Show This Stupid System That This Is Really My Identity? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

""How Do"" - this question shows that the speaker is interested in finding the answer.
- ""Do I"" expresses that you know how to do something and want to be sure of that. This sentence gives the impression that someone else might know what to say and you're asking him/her for advice. Or, perhaps you'd like to find out whether you might be doing something wrong. It gives you a hint about whether the person who is saying this sentence already knows the correct answer and if you are going to learn the same answer as the other person. If you don't understand what is said by the first person (the speaker of ""How""), then ask them to explain the question and what it means. Also, it's important to make sure that this person has the authority or permission to answer your question(s).
For example:
Person 1: ""So, when do you see me again? How are you and your brother doing?""
P2: I'm good with both of my brothers. We have been good to each other. And I'll see you tonight around midnight. I have to run an errand in a bit. 
As the P2 says ""I have"", he/she may know the ""truth."" However, he is not sure if the truth is what the listener really wants to hear. When ""how"", and ""you and"", is used at the end of the sentence and after a verb, then it suggests that it is imperative that he (or she) give a direct answer to the specific question. Therefore, P1 should clarify the meaning of these questions. Otherwise, the response that is offered may be ambiguous. For example, in the above example there are four possible meanings: 1. You and I should see eachother soon. 2. How do I know that I can see this guy again. 3. Should I see that guy in person again in my life. 4. Do you have any ideas about when I might see him next? This shows how it may have an imperative form that says P#2 should be specific with his answer about how long it will be until he sees you again (P#1). However if he or she simply wants an answer that does not imply what they should do. They may just say ""we'll have a drink some"

In other words, if I wanted to know that someone was being dishonest, I might ask them, If you were trying to get out of a contract, what would you do? and, In order to buy the product, you would need to have sufficient funds to purchase it. This is not a case of asking what you might say to someone if you are having trouble buying a product that you want.

470,How Long Will It Take For My Id To Verify?,Considering this utterance: How Long Will It Take For My Id To Verify? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?
A) How long will my id take to verify my information? (1 word)
B) Will my ID (Verification) verification take long?  (2 words)"
471,Why Am I Not Able To Verify My Id?,Considering this utterance: Why Am I Not Able To Verify My Id? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

It is a statement that the speaker is able to identify themselves with a particular group or social class, but cannot find proof of their claim.
For example, the following two quotes both have the same meaning:
""I'm a Christian, so I can't be gay""
and: 
“I’m not gay,
I have a wife and four kids.”
Why would one imply being able find the former while claiming to be homosexual, and the other implies being heterosexual but claiming homosexuality.  If the second is not a valid way to claim a sexual preference, what are the valid methods for claiming a sex- or gender-preference?   Are there more subtle ways to do this? What do most people mean? Do I have to explain what I mean using the words I'm using? Is it even possible? If it's valid, how does the person know? Would this also imply that you can only be heterosexual if you are married? Or can you claim the opposite as well? How far are we allowed to stray from normal, common sense? Are both these statements false or only one? Should I be using different words that are more or less valid? And are all these variations true, all valid and only partially true? Please help guide me!
Thank you so much! I truly appreciate it! :)
Edit: I think that I found a way that is more valid. I've been having a lot of trouble with this, though, because there are so many variations. It's hard to narrow it down... So if it turns out to not be valid please tell me why. Thanks!! =D
So here are some example quotes
  ""There is no such thing as gender.""
 ""Gender isn't a thing.""

 - I would say the first is valid because it is saying that gender is only a
construct of the mind, it could have never existed as is. That is it cannot be proven as it only applies to certain individuals but can be argued that it does not exist, therefore the only thing that would be true is that there is  no difference between men and women, in that both men as women could only have been constructed by the
mind.

  - That statement is invalid because gender, as we perceive it, is actually
there. The mind"
472,It Doesn'T Let Me Verify My Identity.,Considering this utterance: It Doesn'T Let Me Verify My Identity. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

You could say that the person is saying that they would not accept proof that you exist. They would rather have your word than proof. Or you could simply say ""It doesn't let me verify my identity.""
I think the first interpretation is correct. I'm going to assume the latter one because you have a good reason.
Here is an example of the second interpretation, using an object as an argument that says something else about itself. 
""Don' t let it."" You could understand this to mean that if you let something in, it will damage the object. In this case it might be referring to a wallet, as being locked means you are putting the wallet in a position where it may be damaged or the owner may lose it. ""Don't leave that in my apartment"". ""The car is locked."" ""I'm locking the door."" These are all variations of saying the same thing, and the phrase ""don't... it"" can be used in the sentence."

474,Why Am I Having Trouble Verifying My Id?,Considering this utterance: Why Am I Having Trouble Verifying My Id? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I have some experience with the ""why am I having trouble verifying my id"" problem. 
The answer I have for this one is:  ""If the problem was that your ID wasn't linked to you then you need to fix that first and then go back into the system and re-verify."" It can be the same or slightly different depending on the error that you encountered.
Does the answer make sense? And if so, is it the best one possible? Are there better answers?   I would prefer a short/simple description to be more clear and concise. Is it a problem that needs solving? Is there a solution to this problem? If so what is that solution? Should I ask for help from a support person and have the response described here in a more elaborate and complete way, or is there another way? It doesn't have to include ""if"" ""or"".
Note:
My question is not about the id problem itself, but about my answer and its structure. The question here is about why we sometimes have problems verifying IDs that are linked. If a person does not have a linked ID, then there are many potential reasons for why they do not: (1) They never got an email link (2) their email got caught up in spam mail, so they are not getting verification emails (3) the verifier did not receive their confirmation email. (4) The verfier never received a verification email and forgot about it. In some cases there is a very good reason that can explain why the verification is failed, e.g. there were errors on their side (e. g., a different username or a forgotten password).  However there can also arise some strange or unknown reasons, perhaps because they entered the wrong data, the information provided to the website (or to its email) by the user is incorrect, etc. etc.. I am not asking for the reason why I could not verify my ID. I know that, there was something wrong in my account. That is clear. But the question that I want to ask is different, ""How are we supposed to address this issue?"" Is my description and solution correct? In my opinion it is very simple, just a summary of the situation and the proposed solution. Also, it includes the idea behind the solution, which is ""You"
475,I Am Having Issues With Identity Verification,Considering this utterance: I Am Having Issues With Identity Verification What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

This is a difficult question for me to answer because the context of the question is missing. If the intention to the answer is: How can we know our true identity? then then answer would be: we can't. We can never really know, nor can I ever be assured what my true self is. I could be living under a different identity as I know myself and as it may change with age and experience, or a person like me could simply be a fictional character based on me.
As for a more practical answer to this question:
""I don't know who I am.""
I do think that ""I'm having issues with who [name], but I'm not sure about the other stuff"" is grammatically correct, and that means what it says. But I can understand why people have difficulty with it, because most people do want to know what they are, they want confirmation. The only way for someone to really be sure of anything is for the person to have lived under that other identity long enough that s/he will know for absolute certainty that that is who he really is/them. However, I think it is still grammatical. It's certainly more concise than ""Who am I?"" or ""What am i""?, both of which, while gramatically correct are pretty confusing."

How does it differ from ""What could POSSIBLY go wrong next.""

The last time I logged a thread on this forum, I think my intent was one of ""what could go right?"" Now, the question is, how would I ask what could possibly go WRONG?

PabloMar 17 '12 at 14:21
Oh, and I'm a native English speaker.
[I think we can now close the discussion.]
I guess I should have mentioned that in my profile, so my apologies. Sorry, folks!
-P
@Pablob - The worst possible thing, right? I mean it's not a good thing if you've had some kind of problem, but the last thing you want is your account to be hijacked, hacked, etc. so the ""worst thing"" is that your security isn't up-to-date and someone could take control of it. The best case would be that it just happens to someone who has a similar name to you. ""The worst"" thing would include some other problem. For example, you might use the same password for every site, or your email account, which in turn might be used to hijack your forum account. And I guess if your username was 'TheWorstUserName' and 'MyWorseName', then the password used for forum would have been 'THeWOrstUsErNamE' so you'd be screwed and have no way to log in or change it even if someone else was able to get their hands on your password. In other words, 'worst' could be anything from 'worse than a password' through to'something bad has/will happen to me'.
In short, there are no clear rules for when you should use 'could' or'might' vs 'will'. It's a judgement call that each case requires. It would depend on how specific you need to make it, what you're trying to achieve, context etc etc
So, if 'won't' is a word that's commonly used, then I would suggest you keep using it in the negative form. However"
477,Why Can'T I Verify My Identity?,Considering this utterance: Why Can'T I Verify My Identity? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
""Why can't I verify my identity?"" or ""Why cannot I prove to someone that I am who I claim to be?"".
The first is more of a question (that is, is it possible to verify identity without being asked?), while the second implies some kind of action or process that is being tried.
To further clarify, I think it's the difference between ""I want to do something"" and ""Could you please do this for me?"". The former is asking and the latter is saying yes. Similarly, the former can be used to ask permission, while it can also be an order."
478,Why Can'T I Verify My Id?,Considering this utterance: Why Can'T I Verify My Id? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? The answer is that the speaker is expressing the inability to do this for an id that he knows is correct. I can not verify my id, the id in question is in some other database. The speaker wants to express that id.
The utterances of the other two answers: Is ID unique across all databases, and is ""verifiable id"" an industry standard, do not make sense. If a person can verify the identity of someone that they already know to be correct, then how can it be said that verifying an identity on the web is difficult, because I already am verified? And it is very difficult to verify a web identity, in fact, that's why you have to put in your userid, pass, email, etc. And if it's difficult then why does this website even bother asking you for a verification of your id?
I'm a bit confused how this is on topic. Is there something else that I'm not seeing, or does ""how difficult it can be to get a verified account"" not fall into the scope of StackOverflow? Or is this question a duplicate of a question that is already on-topic? Because that would be an extremely stupid question to ask."
479,For Some Reason I Am Having A Problem With Verifying My Identity.,Considering this utterance: For Some Reason I Am Having A Problem With Verifying My Identity. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

My intent is a reason.
""A reason for what?"" (I've been asked).
I don't want to explain it in detail, because I know that it will only be understood if you hear it as ""a reason"", and if it does have details, it's for someone who already knows the context. 
If I say, ""I have lost my car keys"" there's an implied assumption, that you understand who lost the car. It's a short phrase, and the short phrases are the ones that usually have a meaning that has to do with something that can be ""inferred"" from the phrase (or ""extracted"" in the terminology of grammarians). This means that if I want you to really understand, I need to say ""for what reason I have forgotten my keys, but I hope to be able to remember soon because of this reason.""
That's when the sentence becomes a longer phrase and it starts to mean something else. In fact, by making it longer, you can get a different meaning. This is what happens when we have more than two ""parts of a sentence"" that are semantically meaningful on their own without their context being clear. Then when you put them together, the order doesn't matter, they may have opposite meanings, or even no meanings at all. ""She is coming on Monday."" can mean I don’t want her to come, if ""Monday"" is interpreted as the time I'm talking about. (It's not the best way to ask a girl out. But it can happen that the woman is an alien who just landed on the earth from a distant galaxy, doesn‘t know the language, yet wants to get to know your friend. So you could use this phrase to express the fact that I am not interested in you. Just to give an example.)
And, yes, all verbs can have different intents, in fact it happens to most verbs. For example the verb ""to know"" can ""mean"" to ""have an idea of"", so if we say I forgot my money for some reason, this means ""For some other reason"" my wallet was stolen from me. If we were to use the ""know"" verb to make a statement ""He doesn''t really know me"", it would be true that he doesn"
480,What Do I Do With My Card Pin?,Considering this utterance: What Do I Do With My Card Pin? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? If you think you have an answer, then you are right! You are a native speaker. If, however, you do not have a ready answer that fits your definition of what is expressed in the utteration, there is a good possibility that your response is incorrect. This utterances, like all utterations, has its intent. An utterant has an intent to communicate or convey that meaning. For example, in this sentence:

What is your favorite color?
there is an implied intent expressed by the question. It is to express the desire to discover something about the listener that he or she does not already know. The answer to this query may be to learn that the speaker has or is interested in a certain color; it will not be a random choice of a color.
The intent of the phrase: “What do I do with my card pin?” does have one thing in common. In its entirety, it is what I would call: a directive. A directive is any statement that is used to convey a command, a wish, or a request, such as to tell someone to do something, to stop doing something or to wait for something. There are four common types of directives: commands, wishes, requests, and statements of opinion or belief. Directives are often used when the communicator wants to get his or her message across quickly and to a greater audience than one single individual. Examples: I want to leave, the food is ready. You will be happy to know, my father is home. When the directive has the word ‘Do’ in it, usually the message can be read in two ways; first, I will do this. Second, he will DO that. Let‟s break it down further. Commands come in different varieties. ‚Do this‘ can mean I am going to have to perform some specific action; I need you to come over now. Wishes come with ’Want‚, as in I wish you were doing this instead of doing that; or I hope you don„t mind, but I don't think I can stand this any more. Requests are for help. I'm stuck and I'd like your help; let‛s call a taxi. Finally, opinions or beliefs come as statements, with a word or phrase as the subject or"

482,I Do Not Have My Pin,Considering this utterance: I Do Not Have My Pin What is the intent that best describes it?,"? (Hint: it has two.)

This question is a good example of a question that you need to take a minute and consider before you start writing. In this question they do not specify what exactly I do or do do, so I have to decide what it is they are asking. Is it ""I do"" or ""do I""? Do I need an apostrophe here or not? It is also possible that they want a ""yes/no"" response to the question so they need the word ""not"" to convey this concept. I am only asking you these things to help you get to a conclusion that is correct.
The answer to this is ""no.""
However, when you read the whole question, you see that this was a response in the past tense. It reads I did NOT have the pin. The use of the negative sign indicates past time. Therefore, it would be more correct to have a punctuation mark indicating the ""past perfect"" tense:
""I have not the""
You can look at this sentence here:

So we would say  ""He's not dead; he's just sleeping,"" which means he has been dead for a while but now he is back."
483,Are Pin Separately?,Considering this utterance: Are Pin Separately? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?
This post is dedicated to finding out for myself whether there was a single word or multiple word utterances to express the intended meaning that is conveyed in the two sentence versions of the utterables. Is it a question of grammar and syntax? Or a form of semantics? Is there a difference in their grammatical structure? Which one best conveys the idea that the subject and object of this verb are separately in different containers? A question that would be easy if I were to ask in a chat room. So, I decided to look into these two expressions.

Are Pin separately? : This is a common question asked of any object that has to do with containers. A person might ask this question if he/she wanted to know whether a cup of tea/coffee was ready (which usually it is, the water boiled and the tea bags in teacup and cup are ready, separately) or if a person wanted something to drink from a bottle. There are more examples, and most people are familiar with at least one of these types of objects that they may have in common. If you are a child, you had probably played with a pin in school at one time or another. Now you can probably answer the question Are the pins separated? and you might even have an idea of its meaning. But are you a fluent user of English? Are you fluent in grammar, syntax, word structure and language? Do you understand the different types and subtypes of a verb in English that can express different gramatically structured meanings? Then you may not be able to answer that question with great ease. Why? Let us look at two examples in two different languages. I'll use the example of Are pins separate? in both a sentence and a list of words. Let's try the same with Are apples separate. in one sentence:
You might have heard these questions in conversation before. This post may help you in deciding whether you know the answers or not. You may be familiar enough with one language to be an expert in it, but you do not know enough about the other language. To find the correct answer, then, it will be necessary to find out the difference and make a decision based on how you feel that this sentence is different from the English language sentence that I just wrote. Are they the apples of different colors? I don't think so, since the word color does"
484,I Cannot Seem To Find My Pin. Where Is It?,Considering this utterance: I Cannot Seem To Find My Pin. Where Is It? What is the intent that best describes it?,", in a simple sentence? It was not intended to be funny. I cannot find it. My mind is blank. It seems to have no point. Why did the speaker say this? What emotion was he trying to express?

I’ve had lots of conversations. Many of them started with people just asking me, “Where are you from?”. Sometimes this is a natural and spontaneous thing to say. Most times it‚Äôs meant to probe or ask a specific question, such as, ""Where do you study?"" or: ""Who are your friends?""
As a person born and raised in the South, I don‟t think anyone in their right mind would say anything more than ""I'm from Florida"". The word ""Florida"", in and of itself, means nothing outside of it's context in that sentence. You can use it to mean anyplace south of Canada. ""Alabama"" or ""Georgia"" mean different things as well. Saying one of those words just means the person doesn't know their state. And the last state on the list is...
Florida.
So when you ask where someone is from, it just comes down to where do they think they are? There are no qualifiers that would mean something specific. If they do say Florida, then they mean the state and not the people. But if they say ""California"", they actually mean California, as in, from California. They're not saying they're from anywhere else. That may sound harsh. Well, that's why it takes a minute to get to that point in these conversations with strangers. When they don't say what they want, you have to assume that they really do not know. Or, they may just be trying an experiment on you and saying nothing for laughs. Either way, if he really did not even know where he was from and is just saying that, this person is probably not worth your time. Save it for someone who you are at least curious about. He's just trying you out. Don't waste your valuable time on him. (Just kidding, he sounds really, really interesting!)
Now, here's the catch: when someone says they aren't from the south, what does that mean? They are from somewhere in California or Texas or New York? No. Someone from New Jersey"

If there‟s no board there, you  can select „+ Create Board.‰
The second way to setup your Pin is much simpler and it allows you to create a new board with your image for your new pin or to edit an existing board for you image and description. There are many boards on Pinterest that may serve as inspiration, or for editing your card. Here  you can find some of the boards that I find useful.

The first part to focus on the phrase ""Find My Pin"". Do you believe the question is, ""How do I locate my card pin?"" or ""Where is my pin located?""
If you're in a library it is unlikely that ""where is it located"" is your best option. I suggest that your card is in your purse or wallet at that time.
""How"" does not seem too strong as there is no reason that it could be difficult to locate your pin, but it implies that you don't know where it's located."
487,Is My Card Pin Saved In The App,Considering this utterance: Is My Card Pin Saved In The App What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

What kind of a sentence would be a good answer for this question? (I.E. a declarative sentence.)
A. Yes, the pin is saved in the app.
B. The pin saved. This is correct and is grammatically a correct answer. However, is it an action of the subject, a verb? It does sound like an answer to a question. It's just not a normal declarantive sentence. Is this a noun clause or an adverbial clause? I do not think it is a prepositional phrase. If it was, it would say ""the app saves the card pin.""
C. I have the PIN saved on the phone. (This could be gramatically correct, except that it doesn't sound correct. )
D. You have saved the password in your app? How do you know this? Do you mean you think you have? That sounds strange. 
I know it's hard to think of good answers, but I would like to have someone's help to figure out if it could go to the right direction. Thanks. Have a great day. :)
EDIT: I should mention this is an example sentence taken from an interview. There was a long discussion about this and the person was asked to describe the sentence's grammatical structure in words. That person gave the answer of A and I didn't know whether it sounds correct at first because I had never heard of this gramatical structure before. My friend corrected me and said this was inadvertenatly. And it sounded strange to him. So that's why I am now here looking for help. Thank you so much. Your answers have helped me a lot. : )   :)!!!  Thank You. <3. *hugs*
  Thanks a million. @Dennis.Tomb  I feel much better with your help now. =D
@Django: Thanks I did notice that. But I don't think I can use this for a grammar test. Am I right? Because I heard it said that you would have to memorize this sentence and its different words so you won't be able to answer in a similar way. Correct?  But, even then, I still think that my answer is better than your answer and you said something similar to ""This would"
488,I Don'T Know Where To Look To Find My Pin.,Considering this utterance: I Don'T Know Where To Look To Find My Pin. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?.

If the answer is 'To Find' then you can use it as part of a declarative sentence in the present simple tense, or in a past tense or past perfect. However 'I Don't Know' doesn't give that impression. So the best interpretation of 'Where to find' is: 'What is it that I have to do to know where...'
My personal preference would be that 'where to search' would sound the most natural and that the simple present is not appropriate. It should say something like:
I'm looking for a place to look for my pin. 
In your case:   I need to ask someone. I'm wondering what I should ask for."
489,Where In The App Can I Find Out About My New Pin,Considering this utterance: Where In The App Can I Find Out About My New Pin What is the intent that best describes it?,"? A lot more than just the “new pin” is being said and the question of which intent is dominant is of interest. For example, is it asking about the content of the pin (I am asking if the new pin contains any pictures), or about what was accomplished with the creation of a new one (how do I create a pin about something new)? The latter is more appropriate and is closer to ‘Where in the app is there a way to view my new pins?.’

So, for a search query ” Where in app can I find out about new posts“, the first thing is for the query term ’new posts ‑ this implies that the searcher is talking about pins about some new post on the blog. But if we look for ‍-new post, this is a query for looking for some blog post with a specific title that is not yet available on any post or the like, so it doesn‘t really make sense. The second thing to think about are the entities for which the search term is meant to return results. In this case, it is „new ‚ posts or ‛new pins are meant. †
Now, you would want an algorithm to be smart and return the result that makes the most sense according to the provided query. One way of doing that would be to first take the words that are relevant for each of them and look if one is relevant to other. I.e. you could take ""new"" and ""posts"" ‐ but what about ‭„pins‬ ‬and ‮blog post‮‭?  You could also take into account the fact that a blog would have more posts (which would also be relevant) than the corresponding ‟pin.
But of course, there can be more advanced algorithms for it than these. We could just take a look what the Google‍ ‏ ‌search engine ‪‏ is doing. 
‖new‫ post ‖ in‪ Google Web Search [1] ‒ the number of new articles on Google News. It‟s actually not clear whether or not this query is limited to just articles - so if that‛s how it should work, that's a bug. ("

This is a very good question to ask if you are interested in learning more about the English Language. Your native language will help you to understand what is implied in the context of a spoken English sentence.
Here are the options I could think of:
A). To know the number of pins on a piece of equipment. B). This sentence might have a different meaning depending upon the country it is understood in. Here, the word is used as an idiom which means; It is something that can only be found in certain parts of England. C). The pin is to be used for identification. D). Check the pin number on your credit card for its validity. E). A check will be made to find the exact number for which the card is issued. F). You can check the credit information from your local credit bureau. G). It would have an effect on credit. H). He will make a payment in cash. I). We will pay by cash for the service."
492,Do I Need A Pin,Considering this utterance: Do I Need A Pin What is the intent that best describes it?,"? It is a simple statement that asks the question as to what to do if, or how to handle a problem. There are many different responses that might be given to that question. Some would say that I did not need a pin because the problem was easily dealt with when it happened. They might say, “It’s no big deal,” or ‘It isn‘t such a big problem that it warrants attention.“ Others might feel that there is no need for a solution to deal with the situation and therefore there should not be a response to the original question, and they would not offer any response because they do not have a resolution to give you. In some cases, the response might seem too complicated, like, when you were asked, for example, do I need to wear a hat? A simple and clear ” yes„ might appear to be unwise if you are not prepared to respond to questions about other things as well.

The statement, Do you need X. Is not limited to asking the person, what they are going to take action, it is really a question to find out if the action is necessary and it would be appropriate for the condition being faced. For example:
‚ÄúDo you NEED a drink?‗ÔÇØ It›Ñ‰™s a common statement to someone who just asked you if they need anything, as in, they asked ‚Do I NEED to bring a jacket? „ If you answered, ÄÿI need it,ÆÅ, you would understand the next question ÒÐ¢ÊÈÕÓÝ ðð¸ ÀõÀ´Ú‹¾ÞË÷þ‡Ò, ¾ðÏ¹òðð‛ÎýÁÖ, to know what the need is, in this case, a need being to keep warm. ‟It would mean they did need something but there was no way they could get it as it was too cold outside. It would help them determine how urgent the necessity is. That is why the simple ’yes‟ does not suffice when asked Ô¿ìÙ†"
493,"If I Need A Pin For My Card, Where Is It Located?","Considering this utterance: If I Need A Pin For My Card, Where Is It Located? What is the intent that best describes it?","? Is the word a verb (need), noun (pin), adverb (for), preposition (if) or pronoun (it)?

Is the sentence incomplete? Does that sentence include any of the following: (The) (If I), (A)? Is there something missing?

494,What Is My Card Pin,Considering this utterance: What Is My Card Pin What is the intent that best describes it?,".

I believe that the answer is ""I am."" It's a statement of identity. ""Am"" is a contraction of the Latin word ""sum."" In Latin it has a more formal, but still very common, form ""esse."" I will use ""ese"" here and will also capitalize ""Es"" in ""is"" and ""am"" when using the word to express a grammatical subject. The subject ""es"" has to be used because it denotes the existence of that thing as ""it is"" or ""he is,"" but ""to"" expresses identity of something. For instance, I am a boy means that I exist as boy, while the equivalent ""He is John"" would express the identity (existence) of boy in the absence of a subject and without reference to time. To say ""You are"" to someone would be an example of expressing a person's identity, not necessarily existence. It would mean ""This is who you are.""
To say, ""What is My card pin?,"" would imply that you don't know your card's PIN. This would indicate that someone else knows and has control over what PIN you have."
495,And What About The Card'S Pin?,Considering this utterance: And What About The Card'S Pin? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? This is not a question of opinion, but rather, of a definition of the meaning expressed.

In the context of this thread, in the ""what is this word?"" context, the best definition would be: to say, ask or state a specific thing or action. The intent is to ask why a person has asked ""What is X?"" and to state the specific answer or the answer to ""Why?""
""What are you doing?"" The question implies that one wants to know. ""Are you looking?"" ""Where are your eyes focused?""""Why are are those clothes?""The question asks what a given thing is. This does not imply an intent to get information from the respondent in order to make a decision about the topic in hand. In other words, you are being told a fact, not asked a factual question. You are not being questioned about something in your control. So ""are"" implies an active question, where ""why"" would imply a passive question; that is, there is a lack of intent on the part of an inquirer to determine the answers.The intent in this instance may best be to show the fact that the inquire may be answered as to why something is being done. It is also to emphasize that in English, we generally say ""to ask"" where we would say in Spanish ""Preguntar"". Thus there may not be a difference in nuance or intent depending on what is said; however, for the purposes of discussion, I'll stick with ""asking"" and ignore the subtle difference.Now, let's take this to the card game. If you ask ""who is doing the asking?"" the question is ""Who asked the cards questions?"" In this case, if a responder says the other person asked, she is saying in essence: ""I asked you a yes or no question: who asked? You should answer: the person who did ask.""
If you say that this inquire is an ""ask"", it is asking what the reason is that a single person, who is dealing in a card parlor, is holding the asker (the person asking and asking questions) and the respondee (who the questions are asked of) hostage. That's a lot of people to hold for ransom. I can't think of another way to think about it. Thus, by holding them hostage, they are """

499,What Is The Process For Setting Up A Pin,Considering this utterance: What Is The Process For Setting Up A Pin What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The Process Of Setting A Coin. This is one of the most common activities.
In a sentence, why not put the first word first? Why put them this or that way? What’s the process that goes into how something works or happens for a coin. I would describe this as follows: A is a process. C is also a common activity. D is an action. The process is C, which makes the A of A process, and so on. A coin is something that we can use, use something. But it is used. It has been used by a particular person, who has a specific intent when using it to set it up. So the specific activity is to do something with a token. And that”s an easy enough phrase for all of us to understand the meaning of. All the examples are very specific. You know what I mean. They are like an adverb. That“s why it‡s easy to express. Okay. To put a pin or a needle. We set them up as well. Now let›s try it this way. If I had to describe that phrase, I might use the phrase. Let‹s do it by using the words. How do I do this? We‘re going to start this out with the word process and say that it's a word of action and action is what you do. As the same process goes, we‰d say action happens next. Setting a Coin happens. Then it comes into our intent. Intent is going out what we want to happen. When we set a PIN, what do we intend for it. Do we expect that the PIN or the money„s going stay put? Or do you think that you‟re just going through a series of little movements or movements that have happened, that are not going change anything. Why not just put action first and then the setting it? Let's set up these words in that order. There are several ways that I can think of doing this. Here‚s another way we could do the order of it and describe something like that. In this case, the action would be set the coin or to put one in place. Which we did that in the last example. Next would we say we use it for something, or do anything to it"
500,Does My Pin Come With My Card?,Considering this utterance: Does My Pin Come With My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

This is more of a thought question but I thought this was an interesting discussion and I have no answers.
I have asked this question in chat rooms and other forums and people generally agree that the first intent is ""Does this pin come with this card"". In some forums, I am told that ""My pin comes with my card"" is a perfectly correct way of saying the same thing; others claim they would never say such nonsense. I don't know if this is true or not because I haven't met anyone who says the latter statement. 
As to what I'm looking for, the most important criterion is that an answer should address the question ""Is this the correct intent expressed?"" and not ""Which is correct"".   I realize the difference may be difficult to perceive, so I'll provide an example. The intent of this example could be either: ""Did your friend send the email I sent you?"" or ""I sent your email to my friend"". The second is not a ""correct"" answer to the former, because it was not the intention stated by the speaker. But if I asked, ""Why did you send an email from my address to a friend of mine?"", I would be asking a question based on the context of ""you"" in the sentence. ""You"" should be replaced by ""who"" or some other pronoun in this case, not replaced with ""did"". This answer would not be the best one in those situations, though it would answer the ""intent question"" well enough. This is because the phrase could have been replaced in some form by something that still had the meaning expressed. It would still be a reasonable answer in situations like this. So that's my criterion: is an ""intended"" intent answered, regardless of which phrasal form is used, and regardless if it is in a perfect context or a somewhat context-less situation?  If so, then that can be called a correct answer. If not, that isn't a valid answer, but it may still answer my intent question (if my question is about the validity of certain answers, which seems more often than not).
So my final criterion would look like: If the intended meaning can still (maybe in context) be reasonably derived from any valid form in that sentence, it's a good answer (and not just any answer will do). This criterion"

502,Why Isn'T My Pin Available Yet?,Considering this utterance: Why Isn'T My Pin Available Yet? What is the intent that best describes it?,"in the most direct manner possible without any additional words? 

A:
I'm not sure what you were trying to ask, if you have another version in mind, feel free to expand on the question.
If you're wondering why your pin is still not available, that's probably just a technical thing on your part. When an announcement is made about it being ready to be shipped, we have to keep track of the fact that it hasn't shipped yet. So even though it says ""Shipped! You should have gotten an email"", we still need to hold onto that fact until the item is confirmed on an order receipt as being in-stock, and we can delete that from the announcement. We usually send out a second notification when we make that announcement, so we don't leave people hanging after an item has been confirmed to being shipped."
503,Is My Pin Located On My Account Somewhere?,Considering this utterance: Is My Pin Located On My Account Somewhere? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? And what should be the most fitting term for it as it is in the first person?

2. The pin was located on [our] card somewhere [in our office]."
504,"Please Help In Finding My Card Pin, Thank You!","Considering this utterance: Please Help In Finding My Card Pin, Thank You! What is the intent that best describes it?","?

Intent is one of the primary concepts of NLP. We are constantly thinking, talking, and doing things with a particular intent in mind which we communicate to other people by our utterances and our body language.
Our Intent is our message – the message which the other person understands and then responds to. It depends on the words we use and their combination with our words and the way in which they are delivered to the person. The intent expressed can help us decide whether the uttering of certain words in a situation is positive or negative. Let’s take a look at some examples to clarify what we mean by intent. (In this article, I will mainly be using the context of communication with others and not in the form of an action or a state of being).
So, how do we decide what our intent is? We need to know:
What the situation/conversation/discussion or action is about. If the conversation/situation is with someone, there could be several intents. For example, in: I am going to eat. the intention here could simply be the act of consumption, or eating. In: Why are you so late?, the meaning of late implies the lateness of someone”s arrival and/or an indication of lack of punctuality. Or if we are talking with the police, an intent may be to inform about the matter or something else altogether. This is why I always ask, “Why, what“, to get to learn the real intent of a conversation or an act. So, let us take the above example in context to understand the different intensions: The conversation: What are the things you need? I would need a knife for a job in an hour. Your answer: Yes, that‘s why. There is an obvious meaning here, as the one who has said yes, he wants to do a lot of things (in this case, a new job). But what else does the reply tell me? Yes. What else? It also implies a question. Yes what? The next part of their conversation reveals that: A knife. You want a kitchen knife, right? So the question and answer combination tells me that the topic is a need. But it is implied, so I could ask a follow up question of: You mean for dinner"
505,Where Is My Pin Number Located?,Considering this utterance: Where Is My Pin Number Located? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? This phrase is an example of the use of a noun phrase modifier, an adjective phrase, with the noun being my_pin_number. A noun is a word used as an item or substance or an action. It is used to talk about the subject or the object. There are three types of noun phrases, determinate, indefinite, and apposition.
• Determinate nouns are words that clearly indicate what they are about: my, yours, his. Determination is usually marked when a definite article is not added: The my pin number is on your hand. The is marked with a when the determinative is part of compound words: the my car, not the his car. (There are two types a and an; see below.) 

Determinatives can be attached to the beginning or ending of words, or to compound noun and adjective phrases.  They make clear the gender, plural, etc., of determinables. In English, the following noun-modifying words often precede, follow, modify, enclose, attach to, adverb-ize, preceed, surround, appertain to or accompany:
(1) my
   (A) the (m)
the my (s) pin (n) number (k) is in my pocket

(I am using a different method to determine this)
@jeanmar: You know the answer, and you are the most intelligent person who answered this question, congratulations! I just want to help those who do not understand, not just to understand your answer. If you do have your pin in your wallet, please post the question with your name, I will answer in the first 24h. Thank you. :)
+1 for giving the meaning as the title of this thread is not correct!
You could even have written ""I Still Have Not My Passport..."". You did a fantastic job. Thanks for showing how the correct answer can be determined from the text! You are right, this is a very complicated question. It was fun to read. :D
The first step to the solution was finding the right form (that is also not the main thing):
I can'[sic] understand the context and I think it is 'I still haven't got my pin' but there is an omission, an ellipsis, or a typo. 'Got' seems to be the missing word, perhaps 'gotten' or 'not've', 'got' doesn't seem right in this context to me. Perhaps a bit of guess work, maybe this word will pop to mind when the speaker is asked for a translation later. Anyway, you could also just say 'it' and translate. The context is that the woman says this to a man. Both are on a walk and are discussing things about which the man has an opinion, one he does not share with the lady. I would translate 'you still don' [sic][1] have' to 'have' (the missing 't').
What is left to do is translating a single word into one word. But the two most prominent forms are:
a) I still have not/still have no/haven't/don't
b) don still/I don/have still not
Both have the same meaning and only differ in case of the word for 'do'
As you can imagine, the only question"
507,So What About The Card Pin?,Considering this utterance: So What About The Card Pin? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Does your mind immediately begin to wander in a direction or does it immediately become fixated on an idea? This is an important question; it is a powerful question for your brain and how it works.

Here was my initial reaction to the question, so what I want to know about you guys is, what about the card pin? If you think about why it came into my head I think that it’s because I am always looking for ways to help my kids be more mindful. When I ask them about an event that they are having trouble with or even when I just ask if they have any questions, I try to make the questions less directive to them and more a reflection back of what they may be feeling and thinking about. So, if I had asked my kid, So whats going on here? I may or may not get a response, but it would at least be something I could work with to try and help them. If I asked: What about that card? Then, it really depends on the answer. I can‘t say what my son would respond with; but as I was driving home I came to these three words: “So what”, and ‘what if?“. This got me thinking. ”So, whats about this card„. In that moment my brain was fixating on some sort of outcome or outcome of some type that wasn‟t necessarily the one my child expected. Then my mind went to what if. And that is what really got my train of thought and led me to this post. To me the phrase „so what is about‚ is so often used by people that really have no clue what to say or how to react to a particular moment. Maybe that ‒ the way you ask the so-what-question is just a different way of saying something.‭ This, in my opinion, is part of the reason why you hear or see that phrase so much. There must be another reason. Let‧s explore. We all know the power of language in communication. Language creates our world, our reality and our expectations. It is no wonder that, when we use language to ask or describe an expectation, we tend not to be surprised when it actually comes true. The question we all ask ourselves is: how did I expect"

In a similar way, this:
I Am A Good Person, I Can Do The Job, What Are The Criteria For You To Make The Decision? (a)
And the response: That Will Depends (b) Is this a different meaning than the one that is expressed by (c)?
(a): I am a good person, and I can do the job.
But what if I say: ""I am doing a very good job (or not doing anything at all), and there is no need for anyone to evaluate my work. Do what you need to do.""
Can I express this? Or do I need a more elaborated and more polite statement? What about: Do you want more people? How many would be best? And what do you mean by ""evaluate""?
The second: 
If I ask this question: Why Is It Important To Me? and the answer I get is ""Well, you know that"", what is this meaning? is it: (1) The importance of what I want is something that you should know about me. That you are obligated to know. (2) This is how people talk. You know everything about each other. They never really ask for your thoughts. Or (3) something else completely different? I hope I have made myself clear. Thank you, everyone.   )
[EDIT]
Is this how a person would react to this line: The only person who can judge if they have found the card pin is you (the other person)? And why do they feel offended? Would this kind of conversation lead to any argument? [I mean this part of the conversation: the OP tells the other that ""the only thing that can be judged is if you did the search. If you found it, it is yours. But if not, then it can't be yours either."" And then the offended person replies something like: So, if the pin had a wrong number, or an invisible card, the number you got cannot be the actual pin because, in the first place, as you say, there's nothing I could judge.

511,When Do I Receive My Pin,Considering this utterance: When Do I Receive My Pin What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

You may be wondering, “Why can’t I just make it easier on myself?” If you are, then that‘s fine. This blog post is written for the person who wants to learn more about their pin. It‚Äôs written as an introduction to the PIN website and to get things started.
When to Re-Activate My PIN (How Do You Make Your PIN Active?) After the first 30 days the P.I.N. is de-activated. To re-activate the pin, you need to contact your PIN rep. You can do this by either calling our PIN hotline, sending us an email, or logging into the web site http://www.thepin.com and clicking on the Activation Link. I will discuss how to re activate your PINC in the third section of this post. When do I receive my pin? A good question. Well this is not as simple to answer as you might think. The reason for this has to do with some important information that I should share before you make your decision on when to receive your pin number. If there‟s any chance you will be receiving your numbers on a different date as compared to your peers, it should be considered. That‒Å“information is important to know because it․À‹s not the end of the world if you receive a number a few days before your classmates. However, receiving a pin a day or even a month before others, may have some negative consequences that you should know. How Do the Pin Numbers Get to Your Phone. Once you register with the site, the information gets processed to a secure server (in order to protect your privacy) and then gets to an automated system. These automated systems send your information to various third party service providers, such as Google and Amazon. Then the service provides each individual with a PIN that gets sent to their specific phone number in text format. There are times when your service may send messages to more than 1 phone, so make sure you have checked your voicemail before getting upset. My advice is to call the website if a message is showing up on more then one of your phone numbers. Also keep in mind, that if your mobile carrier changes your plan during this time, and you don„Ù™t update your"
512,Help Me Find My Card Pin!,Considering this utterance: Help Me Find My Card Pin! What is the intent that best describes it?,"? A) To ask someone help with getting a lost or misplaced thing like a pin that you use to fasten clothing B) Asking someone to get an item for you C) Helping someone find where they left their lost pin

What is your initial reaction to this phrase? 1. A is wrong, because it implies that the speaker does not know the location of their pin; it is not an actual request for help, but more of an accusation that they know they lost it. 2. B is correct because they are asking for the lost item; they just don't know what they've done with it and are hoping someone can help. This could either be a close friend or acquaintance, a shop assistant, or even a stranger, if they're looking in an unusual place. 3. C is incorrect because this is a request that someone get the item that has been lost for them, not someone else. For example, you could use it in a sentence like this: I have lost my card pin so could you please get me another one?
This is an example of a common error that students of the English language make when they try to write and speak in different modes. To be successful in English, one must be able to shift back and forth between different levels of formality, so that one can respond to a message or question appropriately. In writing, this can be done easily by writing on both sides of your paper, in this case, using an informal form like ""I have"" but using a formal form when writing the question: What time is it? The correct form would be something like: ""What time will it be?"" This is easy to do, since there's no need to make a difference in the meaning. So, why is this important? It's important in order to speak and write correctly.
A sentence in any language can have at least one grammatical error. We all make grammatically incorrect sentences, even when we are speaking or writing correctly and there is no error in our grammar knowledge. When someone hears our mistakes they often give us advice. But, when it comes to teaching grammar, they can become very annoying. How do you know that what people are saying to you about your incorrect usage is actually correct? They often tell you their view in what you are doing and what the best possible way of doing it would look like. However"
513,Is Pin Delivered Separately?,Considering this utterance: Is Pin Delivered Separately? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

Answer
You can also add more words if necessary. The intent of the uttering is that of Pin is not delivered separately.

514,I Can Not Find My Card Pin.,Considering this utterance: I Can Not Find My Card Pin. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

(a) I don't know how to use a card-type pin.
This is a rather awkward and unclear statement. It is hard to understand how this is meant. A sentence like I am lost in your world is more direct. If there is some kind of card, a pin is not the name of a thing. We do not say I cannot find my card pin, we usually say that there must be some explanation for this. I will try to find it or explain this to you. The card is what has the word pin in its name - a label. There is no object of my search. 
I can find a piece of paper pinned to the wall, but I do this because it has a name I know - pin - something like that, I can not find card named pin so I'll keep searching."
515,What Do I Need To Do For A Pin?,Considering this utterance: What Do I Need To Do For A Pin? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? (If you want to be really technical, the question is what do I need to do? And is it a question that has a single correct answer? Or would it better be said there is no definite answer). So in that sense, it's a sentence with two clauses. It can be re-written: “It's something I want” (with an inflection that says what you are talking about) or ” It's not something that I am going to need“ (and the inflected verb says that which you need).

The difference between ‘need-to’ and ’want-in‘ is really very clear when thinking about it this way. If I say: ""Can you go to the store to see if I have a can opener for a friend?"" then it makes sense to say that what I do not 'need to' do is go, to buy the can open. Or that the thing I cannot'make a need' to get, is open the cans.
I think the difference comes with what we might think is not a difference if there were not the 'have a'. If instead of saying 'I want a' one said 'It is a thing that one wants', the whole 'to have' aspect is lost. We have to 'go get'; but we could not say 'He has to go get' because then the verb has not become a present continuous. (I am using the present tense as an example because that is how the most commonly used sentence would be). 
But if someone said: 'Is that a pin I see?' it seems a bit more odd, because to me you cannot say what one is 'going to have'. We are looking at it, but there does not yet seem to a be a 'getting ready to happen' present. To go out and look at something you already have and are not going away any time soon is quite different than going out to find something and make a plan to actually do it."

A) Yes, this is where my stuff should be. B) No, these are the places my things are normally kept. C) These are strange places to leave things to. D) That must be what I put here! E) Why are you asking all these questions? F) Find the things you lose! G) All the people are asking me questions like this. H) Search for and find lost or hidden things! i) We're lost!

518,Do You Use Mastercard Or Visa?,Considering this utterance: Do You Use Mastercard Or Visa? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I was at a party yesterday which had several other guests who I only knew by their first names. We started talking about what kind of car we drive. Then one of them said to the next, ""Your car is so cool. Do you know how to fix it too"".
""Your"" here is used as if the other person is being included in the conversation. In other words the word ""Do you Know"" makes it seem like they were being talked about.
Is this correct and what is a better way of phrasing it? Would it be correct in this case to use ""The vehicle you drive"" instead? 
(This is just the one time, I am asking if this is correct/preferred, but I do like it)
Forgive my ignorance, this isn't a language class but it still seems like something I might learn in a class.   It seems to me ""the vehicle"" would be just as correct as ""this is your car"" because ""This"" is referring to ""your car"". But I'm a little confused. Is the difference of saying ""You drive a car vs Do.you drive that vehicle""?  Or is ""you"" always singular and ""that vehicle is plural"".  What if I want to change a sentence with that same ""That car was my first car""? I would change it to this: ""I used that car as my very first vehicle (I didn't have another at that time)"". So I don't really know if ""use"" can be plural and singular with the same meaning. I guess I could use the words ""used"" but this sounds like a more casual way to talk, and I really don’t want that. ""My first"" doesn't seem right either. If it doesn›t use a noun, it seems wrong. The other way I thought about was this,  "" I drove my car my whole childhood"", but that seems very strange. My first thought was ""Did you do that? Do what?"". But that is definitely not ""using a verb.""
Thank you for your time & expertise
Edit:  Is it also correct to say:
What car do you use? What does it look like? (It can't be used when asking ""What kind do You prefer?)
Does ""to use"" have different"

523,What Is The Process For Using My Credit Card To Transfer Money?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Process For Using My Credit Card To Transfer Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?""

""It's a simple way to describe an entire process. There's nothing complicated about it, and if you're a writer who has trouble with writing simple sentences, your work may very well suffer.""
What are the three words or phrases that describe the situation that led you to the question? The answer to your question comes from the context of the sentence preceding the actual question, in which you stated that you have trouble writing ""simple sentences."" This is your cue that the answer is ""a simple process."" The word ""process"" means a series of events that leads to a result (the end result of your action). This process is a single activity. It does not contain multiple activities (like a multi-faceted approach). To avoid confusion and ambiguity, try to use ""Process"" when you are referring to one activity and ""Activity"" if the activity consists of a number of tasks. If the task(s) are part of an ongoing process that will continue even after the process has been finished, use the term ""Action"" (not ""Act"") as the verb to avoid ambiguity.
Here are a few examples to help clarify ""the process"" in this context:
If you just want to buy something and not worry about how it gets shipped, then the ""Single Activity"" is as simple as going to an internet-based store such as Amazon (or other e-commerce retailer), putting in your credit card information, choosing what you want, making your payment, following the payment instructions and waiting for the item to arrive at your house. This entire purchase process consists only of ONE ACT. (This is why it's called a ""single activity."")
To transfer your funds from your bank account into a separate account (a ""bank account that belongs to someone and you don't have direct access to,"" as mentioned in a link above), you would use your online bank or credit/debit card. Then you go through the same process as described above. A few of these ""one act"" steps: open your account, get a new debit card or check, login into your checking or savings account and make a payment/withdrawal (deposit, debit and credit). In the US, it is possible to make the first payment using your debit/credit card instead of cash, but there will usually be some sort"

Why is this machine not accepting more cards to make things easier for people like us who are trying to do a transaction? That is unacceptable. This is a machine and I am trying for a top off.

I've been charged taxes. I can't remember how often, but I'Ve Been Charging Them. Taxes, not cleaning, have been the biggest burden on my life. It has become obvious that most of my money has already been taxed, if you will, before it even reached the point of leaving my mailbox. And most likely, it never really got there at all. So why do taxes get a pass? What are you going do? Start asking your government to clean your house? Are you kidding? They'Re Already Doing That. Don'T you know? I was just charged a cleaning tax again this year, so why don't you pay up and clean my dirty kitchen!

Intent
–
In linguistics, the lexicographic meaning of a sentence as expressed by the use of the particular lexemes and grammatical structures of that language; the intended, purpose or desired consequence of an uttering or writing the sentence. The lexicolgraphic meaning is sometimes divided into two components: the literal meaning and the implied meaning. Intent, when used in the sense of purpose, as in I intend to stop the dog from jumping, is called the illocutionary act. On the other hand, intent, in its sense as an idea, concept, attitude, view, opinion, etc., as I have an intent to do something, may be called an locution.

The meaning expressed in an uttered sentence is also known as the semantic content of such sentence and is denoted by using lowercase Greek letters. For example, it has been argued that the meaning in a written sentence such as The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog, if we were to omit the phrase The, we would know which fox was meant: either the brown one, which jumps, not the fox, by itself. Similarly, with regard to the original sentence of how to top up the car, how do I top it up?, it would not be clear whose car is meant without an additional phrase, for instance, What do you want me to change? But when we add the additional question, Do you intend me, that would be the context for the question. It is in this way that a question can be used to determine the speaker’s intent. However, even the addition of this extra question would still not specify whether the word car refers to a real or an imaginary car. In many languages, there is an ambiguity whether to use a pronoun or not. This may result in sentences with two different meanings, and in particular in what are knowns are the “truthy” statements, because the two meanings are mutually exclusive. An example is that John is a man or that Mary is pretty. Both statements are literally true, but only one makes sense in context (“he has a beard, Mary‘s hair is blonde‹), another example of ‘truthiness‛ would have been in response to how should I vote? The context determines the choice"
533,"I Am Missing Some Funds From My Account - I Tried To Transfer Them Using My Credit Card Number, And It Disappeared.","Considering this utterance: I Am Missing Some Funds From My Account - I Tried To Transfer Them Using My Credit Card Number, And It Disappeared. What is the intent that best describes it?","?

For this example, I would say it's ""an accusation"".
""He blamed me for the lack of funds.""
It's a pretty common word so it could take many different forms. ""He accused me of having no funds on my account"" or ""I blamed him for having taken funds from my bank account"", etc...
There are more specific words but I think you'll have an easier time using ""accusation"". It's quite common and it gives you a lot of different options.
But I do agree: a simple ""missing funds"" would work, too, and there are a couple of other choices that can help."

1. I hope that this isn't a mistake.
2. That's a great idea. It might make a lot of money. Are you sure that's not a typo? I've never seen one written exactly like
that. Did you mean to write that? It's really strange. Can you fix it or delete the text? Are those my friends? If so, what would you like me to do with them? Can we talk about this later? Thanks!
3. You want to be careful. Maybe I should do that. Is there any chance that I can call you? What if I'm on
the road? Would you prefer to talk later, when we know each other better? Is it a good time for you to come over? Do you want me
to bring you back something? How about dinner tomorrow night at my place? Should I get more beer? Let me see if my car will
start. Should we watch a movie? Oh, you don't like that idea? We'd better have one of our long, philosophical talks. Why? Just
because. So...what do you say? Will you help me? That is, do we have an offer that will be suitable for both of us? Does this
look familiar? Maybe it will jog your memory. How does it feel? This is just how I feel inside about you. If you're not interested,
I'm fine. The thing is... I really want you
5. Well, I am not really sure what I would like to say. There is only one thing I know for sure. No, let me tell you another thing. Oh
no, this can't be true. Does that make you angry? Why did you do this to me! It is a very bad joke. Who would say this! I
would be so angry! He's just crazy! What a terrible joke! You're kidding! That can never happen. Do they know that you told

535,How Do I Transfer Money Using A Credit Card?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Transfer Money Using A Credit Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? This question is asked to help understand the meaning of a particular phrase with a purpose to know something that we can’t know from the phrase alone. In order to make the task of determining the intended meaning clear, in this exercise let‘s add a few words to our expression:

How do I transfer money using my credit card?
I used the credit to buy a gift.
The gift cost $10. How much money will we transfer to the friend? A gift was given. $1 was transferred to him/her. Money transfer was done using the “credit” card and is called transferring money ‘using a credit.“
To know how much is transferred we don‟t need to ask how many dollars are transfered. We can know the amount by asking „How much do we transfere to my friend with the $100? What will be the answer when we know that amount?„ The question ”How is it transfering money when it uses a card‖, implies that there was a cost to be paid to use the card, and then the money is transferee. The money transferer is me, not my ‟card. It doesn‛t matter whether the recipient is in my country or another country and I was asked ‚to pay the fees of the transferences―. So if the fee is $0.01 per $ transferred, the result is: $1000 = $.10 x 100. And it is clear that this is only the cost. If the person had not transferred $200, we could answer that he/she transferred $600. But we do not need that kind of information to determine a price. For that, you should use a calculator, which you have not got yet. Let‚s try to add some words: ‹How can it be transferencing money without charging the receiver? – Well it will not do. That does not make any sense. Why do you ask? There are no questions here. Just tell that you asked, why do people ask a lot of questions? And I don't even know, what I should ask. This is an answer in a question. †What do they do to each other? ″ – I do know: They make jokes. – They joke"
536,Can I Give My Friends Access To My Account So They Can Top It Up For Me?,Considering this utterance: Can I Give My Friends Access To My Account So They Can Top It Up For Me? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

For our purposes here, I am going to define a few terms to assist us with our analysis.
- Intent: the reason why the user decided to type in a given combination of words. - Sentiment: a value that represents how the author feels about a subject. We can measure it by the polarity of the words in the text. Negative words have a low sentiment, positive words a high one. Sentimental Polarity Analysis (SPA) is a well established technique for analyzing sentiment and has been successfully applied in many different scenarios, including natural language processing applications to name just a couple. To get started I would suggest doing a quick and dirty implementation of this algorithm with a list of some example texts. Feel free to use my code as is or modify it as you wish. This is what I use:
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
count_vect = CountVectoizer()
cv_data = count_vec.fit_transform(example_text.split())
print(cv.vocabulary_)
[0, 4, 3, 6, 2, 5, 0], [4, 1, 8, 7, 11, 10, 14],... [3, 15, 9, 12, 19, 23, 17],
This will give you a matrix whose columns are the most common words found in each text and whose rows are words and their relative count in that text, and which can be used to find, for instance, the sentiment polity of each. If you look at one example of mine, you can see how it would tell you: I hate this text with an SPA score of 0.4. Now, it should be noted that even in our example, a text can have more than 1 word per row, so the SMA of ""I hate"" will be less then 1. The point is that you are able to calculate the overall sentiment of any text even if it is very short and you will get a score from -1 to 1 that can help you assess the content of your text better. You might want to see some examples of SAMA analysis, this is one of them: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/11/sentiment-analysis"
537,"I Did A Top-Up, But I'M Not Seeing It In My Wallet Yet.","Considering this utterance: I Did A Top-Up, But I'M Not Seeing It In My Wallet Yet. What is the intent that best describes it?","?

(Note that ""did a top-up"" is an idiom used in the context of banking. It means that I was charged a fee at the time of transaction.)
If it is to be said as such that:
1) the person is not seeing the money in their wallet yet, or
2) he/she did not see that money yet?"
538,"I Know I Entered The Right Info, But My Top Up Isn'T In My Balance","Considering this utterance: I Know I Entered The Right Info, But My Top Up Isn'T In My Balance What is the intent that best describes it?","?

A:
C
B
In the example sentence C fits best in the utterment. I think that in most other cases C is also a good choice.
I'm aware there is a difference between C in general and C as an interjection, but if we restrict the sentence to one word utterances, it's hard to imagine the difference. (Colloquial, of course, there might be a slight difference.)
As an aside, the other three choices are grammatically wrong."
539,Will My Friend Be Able To Top Off My Account?,Considering this utterance: Will My Friend Be Able To Top Off My Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,", the meaning is exactly the same. The answer that makes the most sense to many would be the one that gives all the words the closest to their dictionary meaning.

For instance, “Can A Girl Be A Good Person?” the answer given would include adjectives like ‘good’, but it won‘t be limited to only them, it may also include the verb ’person“, which could be ‟a person„, or „a good person.‟ In fact, that is what the definition is, a good ”person. And the correct answer to ‚Will My Friends Beable to Top offMy Account‛ is ‛Yes my friend will beable top off My account‹.
In this phrase there are two separate clauses, and they both have subject, predicate and object. So, both of your friends need to be able to top of MyAccount. But it is not the exact same meaning of both these clauses that matters here. It is just that the first (or second) clause means what it says, whereas the second doesn‚Äôt. You might think this is a bit like: ‹Will my best friend be my girlfriend? No because it asks about a condition of being (※1), not about being able (to, as the predicate verb).›
And so there is an ambiguity in this question, because one of the meanings of ‪My friends will Top of my account. ″ is that my friends are good enough for me to trust them with top-ups on my card. That is how most people think of a ′Top off (of an order, account) ‡, so ‑‬I can ‰top offmy card′‖ is their way of asking ‭Can my good friends Top (my order) off my (order) card? ‮It is also their (common) way to ask ‏‰‮Can a Good (person) Top-off my Card‭ ‏. If you say the word ‬Topoff  in the negative, (ie: Can a girl be a top) the question is:‧Can someone who is female be top‡ of anything? In that case the person"
540,Is There A Way To Transfer Funds Directly From My Card?,Considering this utterance: Is There A Way To Transfer Funds Directly From My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

Consider the following utterances:
Is there a way to transfer $1000 between bank accounts without using my card? Is there any way that I can transfer money directly from my credit card to my checking account? Does anyone know any bank transfer systems? Can I transfer directly to someone else's checking or savings account (in the U.S.)? Are we talking cash or online here? Do I need my personal identification for the person I want to pay, and if so, do I use a card, a check, or electronic bill pay? I'd like my money transferred within a business day. Am I asking for a lot? If so is there an automated way of doing this? Could any of the banks allow me to deposit or transfer a few dollars to any other account in the bank? Or, is it simply easier to use the ATM card or debit card for that? What if I'm overseas? Should I have a US bank account first or just use direct transfers for my savings or foreign bank transactions? The amount varies from a $100 to over $3000. If you need any further information, please let me know.
I am going to ask for your advice. Please respond. Thank you. I don't like to write long and detailed letters, but I am hoping to get your thoughts. Let me start by telling you that my life is not easy right now and I find it difficult to explain, let alone articulate, the problems in my head. My wife and kids need the money that is in our savings accounts, which we have transferred into them, because my job has been eliminated and we're in dire need of money. In addition, my daughter is graduating from high school soon and needs funds in her savings bank for her college expenses. Since this is a graduation ceremony and not a family celebration, I must think of others than myself. How to we transfer the savings from the US into the other country? Please let us know what we can do for you so our situation and lives will remain unaffected. We will be glad to help you get the job and money you and your family need. Also, if there is someone whom we know in a specific city here or the state over, would you like us to call them and get them to contact you?

It's been my understanding that the reason why my top-up hasn't shown in my wallet (for my mobile phone) is because I didn't register with a SIM operator.

I need to see this phrase on a form and the best option I can think of is: ""I tried to top up using my card"".
My question is : Is this correct? Can I change the word order? In this case how should I write it? And is it correct to write ""and now the money"" and remove that last "".""?. I think this is more appropriate but I might not because in this particular case the ""money just disappeared"" is what I want to convey.
How to explain this in simple way so that it can be understood by native speaker and how to understand it for myself as I am not native?. Is the way I have described the sentence in the title right? 
Thanks in advance.   :-)
Update : I just checked the Cambridge Dictionary and they say that my sentence is correct but not idiomatic. So, I will stick to it but how would people express it as idioms? I mean, how does the phrase: Money just gone missing!, express the same concept of the above sentence? What words would you use? or how you would explain to your friend or colleague in person? Is it more or less a native way to say it and if yes, why?..
Sorry for being a bit confused. Hope it is a clear question. Sorry for any mistakes..  :)
Note: This question might seem a little silly but there is something I really don't understand about this topic or phraseology. If anyone could clarify it it would be appreciated. Thanks. :-)  :D
UPDATE 2 :  This is not a duplicitar, this question actually relates to the use of idiomes.. I would like to learn how native speakers use it. And how it's not correct. Thank you all. :P :-) and thanks for all the answers and comments. This forum is awesome. :) Cheers!!!  ;-) ...
NOTE : After seeing all of these interesting answers, my understanding of this type of question was incorrect.

It was not about the words themselves, but the idea expressed in a particular order that could be reworded. That question has"
543,Help Me Transfer Money To My Credit Card.,Considering this utterance: Help Me Transfer Money To My Credit Card. What is the intent that best describes it?,"? 
Is ""to"" necessary here?
I think the first part of the utterances is just telling that the speaker wants to transfer money to her card, while the latter part ( ""..to my credit card..."") makes us think of a credit to a specific amount of money.

A:
- Help me transfer
   money
+
 to my
 card
...
(to the credit
 of my card)
What do I think? Help you to tell me what I'm talking about, to put it more clearly. I see two things: I can help you, and I help my friend, where I also need the help of your card. That's the meaning I would like to convey. The first half of you help me means that I need help to help myself, I don't know if I understand you. As my mother says: the only one who understands is me. If I understood you correctly, you want to use my money in my account. So it's a transfer of funds. (This interpretation doesn't make much sense, but it could be possible.)"
544,I Tried To Use My Card To Top Up But All Of The Money Has Disappeared.,Considering this utterance: I Tried To Use My Card To Top Up But All Of The Money Has Disappeared. What is the intent that best describes it?,".

The intent here is not to understand this question or to solve a particular problem but, instead, to try to get an understanding of the range of possibilities that exist. There are a number of things that can be said to describe the situation. However, they may not all describe all the facts of this situation in the same way. Therefore, in a sense, this might be a very difficult question for which there is no single right or wrong answer. Nevertheless, we can attempt to see what range exists and then focus on a specific set of facts. As such, there may be certain aspects of these facts that seem to support one interpretation and aspects that support another. It is up to us to sift through these two or more perspectives and see which works the best with our individual set on beliefs, expectations, and opinions. The following three are the most common interpretations that are available. One interpretation says that the person is trying to express:
1) the experience of having all of their money gone when they try and top up their card, i.e. they are frustrated with the service and their inability to make this work. This may result in their trying something that will get it to work so they can get their remaining money back. They can also be thinking of something they want. For the sake of our example, let's assume that it was money that they wanted and they were frustrated because not enough would go into the machine. That would result on the part of someone who is having problems. In that case, the statement could read something like; "" I tried to top off my card but all $100 is gone"" or
2) ""I tried and it didn't work"" (I don't think anyone could really say that this means the money just disappeared. If I wanted to say so, I'd have put it like, ""The system didn’t work and I lost $5."" But, that's not what the question said. So, it must be the case that I didn""t top it off."" The word""try"" seems to indicate that no other thing was tried.)
3) that someone used a card and the system did exactly the opposite of what was intended. Here, an example would be to think that some thief took someone else's money and is now making off"
545,Is It Possible To Use My Credit Card To Transfer Money?,Considering this utterance: Is It Possible To Use My Credit Card To Transfer Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,", with the context of the question?

I would suggest the answer is:
1. This is a very common occurrence and no, it is not possible to use your credit card for this purpose.
2. The purpose of using a credit is to borrow money.  When paying back a debt, you do so with something of equal value that you own (usually cash or check).  There's no cash value in a CC. (Of course, the credit cards are often tied to a bank account but, even if they were tied only to your checking, there would be no value transfer to the card.)  That is, as long as the account balance is less than $0, nothing is transferred to that account."
546,How Can Someone Add Money To My Account?,Considering this utterance: How Can Someone Add Money To My Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? And why?

I think it would be an idiom in the form of an exclamatory question, like ""Whoa!"", or ""What?"", or even ""Are You Kidding Me?!"" in a context where an expression like this isn't likely to be said with any kind of irony or sarcasm.
An example of this use can be found here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoop_%28novel%29
The author is using two questions, each with a slightly different meaning. The first (Who?) asks ""How?"" (or ""Why?"") to the second (Are you kidding me?) which asks the speaker to express incredulity. A similar sentence structure would include exclamation points like: ""I'll kick your ass!""
This use of a pair of questions doesn't seem to have a standard phrase that is often used for this purpose; the author of the link above chose to use the phrase ""whoop"". But it's a good word, and it works well here."
547,Cannot Access My Top Up.,Considering this utterance: Cannot Access My Top Up. What is the intent that best describes it?,"(in this case 'cannot' and 'top up')?

A:
[Intent]
The sentence is asking you to find the closest equivalent for ""I want to use"" (the preposition ""to"". This is a question to express you want.  
You could say ""Please open the door for me"" which means ""you should help me"".  However, for this sentence, you could replace the ""open the"" part with ""access"". For the sentence I provided, the phrase ""please open my access"" is correct. (Although you can say, ""for me"", instead. For instance, in the movie, there is an actor saying,  ""...for the love of your life, please open it"".)
""I'm trying to access my top up""
Here, it's asking ""how am I going to top the battery level?"" If you're trying the top-up, that's not correct, but maybe you mean top. In that case, I could ask, how am ""top"" going? To which, a similar answer would be  How am top? Or, How top am?  Again, to could be used instead... ""How to get up?"", ""Who to talk to?""
Also, just in case you don't know what a topup is, we use a battery or car battery with a special device that allows you do top your battery up. It sounds like he may want top his battery to 100%.
There are a ton more ways to say this. This will suffice, though."

Rate this answer:
1. To pay someone else
2. Transfer money from my savings to my credit card
I guess ""transfer money to credit"" would mean (2). But if it's (0) and you mean that, for example, ""My dad is sending $100 on my account"", then I have a slightly different take. My dad doesn't have $1 to $10 in his account but his bank account is attached to his credit account. (If you have an account like that then you may have to clarify what you meant.)
And if you didn't mean to pay money (in the way that would be considered ""to pay"") then it is best to say something that makes the statement you wrote unambiguous.
What would a native speaker say for ""I have transferred money on to (a bank) card""? (I'm not sure which verb is used and in which form.) If I were in the banking business this question would not arise but for the general public this is relevant. If the bank were closed it would only be relevant for customers of that bank (or for others of those banks that accept deposits).
In the example in your question I think I would say: ""He/she has transferred the money onto the card (of my bank). It is available as soon as (the card) is re-activated. The money is not available for spending now or until a later date. It would have been available today (and/or later today) if I had made a withdrawal (as requested)"".
Edit: And if the question is really ""Can I get $500 (US) or (UK) transferred to this account (without going through a bank)? If so, I assume that the answer is negative - if so that should include what is meant by ""transferred"" here and the reason. For example: The account owner has asked for a transfer from an outside bank and it has been blocked. ""Transferred to what account"" or ""on what card"" are different questions from ""can I do this""?

• A simple, short sentence or phrase that has one topic, a single main verb, and no prepositions or conjunctions.• The speaker should be clear about what you‘re saying. Try to avoid using vague or ambiguous language like, “I believe,” ” it appears“, or „to my knowledge.‟• Avoid double negatives, vague words, passive verbs, overly complex sentences, complex tenses, colloquialisms, clichés, slang, metaphors, acronyms, etc. • Be sure to capitalize the first word and last word of each sentence. If your sentence has more than one subject or subject verb pair, use an appropriate conjunction to join the subjects. Avoid using a comma splice, two-word, split infinitives, dangling participles, incomplete verbs etc, unless they are absolutely necessary. Remember to use your own judgment. You should only use a conjunction/conclusion that most writers would use. The conjunction should not alter the meaning. It should either be obvious or not required. Be consistent in your use of the conjunction. Use it correctly every time. A few of my favorite examples: A) The man said, ""I like to eat ice cream."" B) ‚He' didn‚t eat the pizza before he left. C) We are going to the theater. ‰‰ D) It appears there will be a snowfall. E) She said she was leaving the job and would call in a week to inform them. F) Don‌t call me until I call you. G) There are two ways to make something clear. One is to explain yourself. But the other is just to be direct and to have the confidence that when you say something, it‏will be understood. – Stephen King

I thought about this for a while and decided that the sentence was about:

I think: To-Do or Get-Go
This would not be the only possible interpretation or interpretation. In fact this is not the most common. It is often interpreted to mean To Do This. The most popular interpretations are:
1) My friends think I should get going and do this.
2) I think my friends should do it (they will not).
3) To do is to get done. 
The last interpretation is probably the least likely. This is because this type of expression does not make sense. A common way to say ""go to do something"" is ""will go do."" So in this sentence, ""to do"" would be a synonym for ""get"" and the sentence would still not work. However, this could be said, it is just not a common phrase. If you want the phrase that is most commonly used to express this idea, then I suggest the following:   Go Do It. I am not sure how to properly pronounce it, but it means ""Get it done."""

2. In the context of this example, is it correct to say that it is an incomplete sentence as it lacks a main clause.

This is for a class in English composition and I don't know how much we'll be focusing on this type of sentence. This may or may not be considered a complete sentence but the one-word sentence does express the meaning of the sentence and is also a valid sentence, as such, I feel it should be covered in grammar.

So the question comes from that sentence:
""It should also be noted that the grammatical form of a question is not dependent upon its function as an interrogative sentence.""
Now the example question: This is a grammar exercise to see if we are paying attention in class. My professor says no, but what are the other options that make up the answer? I've been thinking about it and trying to come up with my own answer to the problem (in my mind I see three options).
1) Who can top up my account? - This option would be the best grammatically, the form is perfect as the subject agrees with the verb in this instance and the predicate expresses an intent (Who) with no direct object (to top me). So it could technically be classified as one word. So the short answer is ""no""
But I think there is another option here. For example I could write: 
Who can get me my money on my bankcard. - That would probably cover my intent of ""Get me money"". It could also express other intents like: It should go to my brother and my mother (or whatever you want him to do), or I should receive the money, etc... So my professor would call this a ""clarifying"" question where the clause that follows acts as part of an ""intent"".
I think another example could be ""Why did he go back in the house"". The question would act as your intent and then a clause would come after it, clarifying. Then you could answer the ""why""?
My question then, should the grammar teacher say this is correct? It seems that this would make sense for the purposes of class,"
555,Show Me How To Top Up With My Card,Considering this utterance: Show Me How To Top Up With My Card What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Is there any doubt about its meaning in the mind of the recipient?
If there is no doubt in your mind, you don't have to look at the context and intent in order to answer.  
The only possible issue might be whether the phrasing ""Show me how to top-up with my card"" is idiomatic or not, although that may not be relevant with one-word phrases."
556,I Topped Up My Card But The Money Disappeared.,Considering this utterance: I Topped Up My Card But The Money Disappeared. What is the intent that best describes it?,", which is also in the context of this phrase: the uttering of a statement, the meaning of which has been determined."
557,What Are The Limits To Using Disposable Virtual Cards?,Considering this utterance: What Are The Limits To Using Disposable Virtual Cards? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The sentence is about two possible limitations on using disposable virtual or physical card: 1) the limit of the cards and 2) time.
You can think this way:
Card limit is physical or virtual - that is, is it physical (real) or is a virtual (in software) card. In this case, the physical cards are cards that you use and can see/hold. And you have a limit to how many cards you can use, but this is also a physical limit, such as the number of physical memory slots or number physical disks. Or how long you want to play with the virtual cards. The time limit could be how much time you're going to spend with virtual machines (VMs) and that virtual storage. 
So these are both limits: (a) physical and (b) a time restriction. That is: a) you cannot have more than X cards or b) I'm going on vacation (or leave my physical work station for some other reason) for at least Y days."
558,How Many Transactions Can I Do With One Disposable Card?,Considering this utterance: How Many Transactions Can I Do With One Disposable Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The answer: a) the one intended to answer the question or b) a combination of both the two questions. Let’s try answering the sentence in A).
For me, the most natural and logical way to translate what the speaker (in the given example) is saying is that a card can do only one transaction a day. It makes sense that the card has only so much to spend each day, and it‘ s natural to express the fact of “transactions“ as the amount of money spent, which in this case would be $2. So:
a) The card does one $transaction.
b) If the person wants to do multiple transactions a single day he must get multiple cards. 
Now, let‗s move on to B). In this instance, it may be interpreted that one person needs to use multiple types of cards on the same day in order to carry out multiple daily transactions. However, if the statement is taken at face value and the intention is not to convey that, then B) would make sense if it were said that ‘there is only a certain amount (card) that can be used to purchase multiple items.” This statement would mean exactly the opposite of the intended meaning. That is what is called a „fallacy of equivocation„. A) and B‟s intended meanings are mutually exclusive (they cannot both be true), yet each one is being described as though they actually meant the other, so the listener assumes that they both mean the exact same thing. In other words, even if you want to believe that A is true, you cannot believe both. And conversely, in B, while you are trying not too believe A, that will be the thing that you‰ı��re going for, because the only way that is going to happen is if B is believed, but that won‚ıt be a good plan because then you will not be able to accept the truth that B can‡ıı mean that there are more cards than what A describes. If, however, someone is intentionally saying what they mean is both that and not both, we can call them a liar. But it is important to note that if they don‬ı‹ıîïıí are"

The phrase ""How many times can I use the Dispose VirtualCard I have""? This phrase is not ambiguous or difficult to understand, so, the correct option would be: I don't know. This question is for testing whether you have the knowledge of this language and can understand the meaning of the utterances, expressions and words of a language that you study or not.

This uttercence: What Kind Of Person Likes The Most? What the best choice that is correct about the interpretation of its meaning?
Answer. The correct answer is: This person is a kind-hearted person. I do not know whether this is true or false. To learn the language more you can see the answers to the following questions:
What Kind Person Likes The Best?What Does It Mean The Person Is Kind-Heartened?Do I Like Him?How Kind A Person You Are (The One Who Likes A Lot)?
Which one of these phrases should use to say the same meaning as the first: The one who likes the most, who is kindest, or the one is liked most in the whole world? Which one sounds like it is spoken by a person, and which one like to hear spoken?

560,I Think Someone Is Using My Card To Make Transactions I Don'T Remember.,Considering this utterance: I Think Someone Is Using My Card To Make Transactions I Don'T Remember. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?
I have heard several definitions and I have a hard time picking one as the best.

A:
– Intention is a word meaning a goal, wish, desire, objective, purpose, or the like of an agent or of a situation. You can be intending to do something, intending an outcome, expecting a person to be there or even something about someone. The word can have negative implications when used in a context of “I don’t care”. I can only think of the most likely answer. This is an example. – 
The definition of Intend as ‘to have the purpose or effect of doing something.‘"
561,Someone Is Using My Account,Considering this utterance: Someone Is Using My Account What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

a) to inform, warn
b) misuse of a customer service
c) a statement, phrase uttered when an account is not yours, and the uttering of which results in the account changing hands
d) None of the above.
e) I don't know. The intent was unclear. You can interpret any utterances of this kind from any number of different angles. Maybe you're asking what's wrong with it, rather than what is it? Maybe a more precise word would be appropriate? This seems to be an example of vagueness. If the statement could be interpreted more than one way, how could one answer your question? You could say that the speaker was trying to warn you about something, but there's nothing specific there. It could also just be a vague statement. This isn't to say what this person actually meant, just that it doesn't really answer what you are asking about."
562,Someone I Don'T Know Has Used My Card Without Permission.,Considering this utterance: Someone I Don'T Know Has Used My Card Without Permission. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

(The following is an example of a multiple choice question. Please do not use the same answer twice.)
1. Intention
2. Desire
3. Wish
4. Suggestion
5. Request
6. Complaint
7. Advice
8. Warning
9. Threat
10. Plea
11. Order
12. Command
13. Demand
14. Requirement
15. Recommendation
16. Invitation
17. Remark
18. Explanation.
The correct answer, of course, is number 10: 'Suggestion'.
Why? Because, you see, the person who has used your credit card is using their credit. They have, through an intentional act, created an obligation on your part. You are expected to honour that obligation. The'suggestion' is being used as an attempt to influence or persuade. That is, it is not a request for something. It is a demand, which is what you get when you ask for someone's time. An 'invitation' suggests the act is voluntary. If someone had come into your home without knocking or asking your permission, that would probably be seen as 'demanding' and 'asking for' something, in that you are being forced to do something you would rather not do. I don't know what your definition of'request' might be, but if you want to know the correct usage, look at the difference between using your right to be free and not being asked to perform a task. For example, let's say someone was to enter your house and tell you that, if they were to continue, they expected you to offer to help them get some groceries. This would almost certainly be construed as being a 'demand', since you have a choice about offering or not offering help. But you probably wouldn't feel that way when the doorbell rings and someone says: ""Hey, I just had this idea that I'd like some fruit. Would you mind doing me a huge favour and going to the store and buying some? If you'd rather take the bus or drive yourself, no problem."" That person is trying to convince you about what they think would be a good idea. And, although they might seem like friends, what are really doing is suggesting to you what should be done. In your"
563,My Card Was Used Without My Permission.,Considering this utterance: My Card Was Used Without My Permission. What is the intent that best describes it?,"? The word of phrase is “My”, the object that the word is referring to is your ‘card’. Now, take ’em out the the kitchen and say: ” My card was used without my permission..“. What‘s the intended meaning? I‪m still not sure. It‬ „‹has‰›‼ to be a sentence but I can‚t figure out what it is saying.

This may come across as pedantic, but if the sentence is incomplete, you need to make sense of it. So if there is something missing that you can add, say it and use it to give context. Then you might have to edit it, or delete it if you find it distracting. But, in general, your sentence should work without a missing part!

567,Can You Freeze My Card Because Someone Used It While I Was Out Of Town. I Did Not Make These Purchases.,Considering this utterance: Can You Freeze My Card Because Someone Used It While I Was Out Of Town. I Did Not Make These Purchases. What is the intent that best describes it?,", and then a list in ascending numerical order of items you purchased. If you can't find the answer to that question, you may have no choice but to consider the purchase.

A good question to ask is if the transaction is an extension of the last purchase, what's the value to them? If it's an addition to the list, it is likely they had a problem, or they want more products, they're trying to make your purchase a higher purchase total on the same list and they know you are not aware of it. In this instance a call to customer service or email or both may be warranted. For instance, ""Your order was for a $50 gift certificate that I received. Can I get it back from you or is it lost?""
This may seem a bit like a silly suggestion, because they did receive the gift card, however it could be possible that they simply forgot to turn the card over. Sometimes that happens with us. But, if they truly forgot, then they need to correct that, in this case with a gift code that is valid for $0.01 on your next purchase of $25 or more or something along those lines. It may not be the end of what you had in mind, but it makes sense, right? (The $1.00 coupon that you were also sent does come with this offer)
I just purchased a laptop and I am going to be traveling for several months and will be purchasing an Amazon Prime Membership, which will allow me to check my orders through Amazon's website. Will I be able to use my Amazon gift cards while I'm away? I know that when I was a student, one of my professors used the Amazon.com website to order textbooks. He could access his online Amazon account while he was out of town and receive them in the mail without the use of his credit cards, so I figure this would be a similar situation. Thanks!

569,Someone Else May Be Using My Card.  There Are Transactions I Don'T Recognize.,Considering this utterance: Someone Else May Be Using My Card.  There Are Transactions I Don'T Recognize. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
In your example, that would be a statement of intent to steal and not an actual plan in action. That would indicate someone who is a master thief, and may have some kind of a plan, but it isn't yet executed.
If someone were to say ""I am going to buy something on your card,"" then that could be indicative of an intent and plan to do the deed. They just haven't gotten that far yet."
570,What Do I Do To Stop Unauthorized Transactions On My Card? I Was Never In The Place From Which The Transactions On My Bill Were Made And I Never Made Them. Please Help!,Considering this utterance: What Do I Do To Stop Unauthorized Transactions On My Card? I Was Never In The Place From Which The Transactions On My Bill Were Made And I Never Made Them. Please Help! What is the intent that best describes it?,"? In the first case the action is to cancel. The phrase ""to stop unauthorized transactions"" can be used to refer only to canceling a transaction in the sense described. If the statement is read as ""cancelled,"" the meaning refers to some process of cancelling a previous act of giving permission to do a thing in which the speaker was not previously involved.

This is a common mistake with ""stop"" and ""end,"" especially with verbals like ""go"" or ""do/see/get/find"" in English, where the subject of the verb is implied. For instance, ""Stop him!"" could be read ""Find him!"". This happens even when the word is used in a sentence like, ""...I stopped him from going any further.""
The answer to this question is quite simple. It is ""Cancel"" if the person did not authorize the transaction. Otherwise it is, 'You do not want the service'. The reason I say it's simple is because you already have the answer right in front of you. ""I"" does not always mean the pronoun ""you"", which means that ""What do I do"" could really mean ""How do you do"". That being said, the sentence is not asking you to describe the solution, but rather it says, how did they do it, or is it possible to stop it. That is why the ""or"" is in such a position, because we're looking for possible solutions or actions that would solve the problem. As such, it could mean either ""You don't want to provide it"", or it can mean that you want it to end. In that case, you would say,
""You want me to Cancel it."" In this way, canceled can have two meanings. So, what do we want, is for the authorization to be revoked? If you're saying that the authorizations have been revoked, then we say

This question is similar to, What do I do if I think my credit card is stolen? but it is not the same.
The phrase in the first question asks about the possibility that the credit was used by someone other than the card owner. It is more likely that your credit has been stolen than that someone else has used your card, so the best answer to the original question (inform the bank that it was stolen) is probably the most appropriate answer. However, your question could be asked as, ""If I feel like there's a problem with someone using my card,"" in which case the ""I think it's been used"" is part of the phrase as well and it makes sense to talk about it with the person with whom you have concerns."
572,How Can I Stop Fraud On My Account Right Now?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Stop Fraud On My Account Right Now? What is the intent that best describes it?,"(or part of speech of such phrases? How can I stop? What would you do if this occurred?

You are the CEO of your local bank and your friend called you on Tuesday morning to ask you to wire $100,000 from one of their bank accounts to him at your bank. When they asked you how they could stop you from doing so, what would be the best response? In this scenario, we are talking about money rather than physical goods or products.
The correct answer is: “How can you stop me from sending you money?”
Let’s take a look at how you should respond to this question:
How To Stop a Fraud
There are many different ways that you could prevent a fraud from happening on your account. First I will discuss the most popular and easiest fraud to detect: fraud by phone. You can also talk to other bank customers about the phone fraud that can and has happened in their accounts as well as other methods of fraud. There are a few different types of phone calls or texts, but most are pretty similar. The following is a list of the different phone numbers that people may call to try and gain access to your banking info. Each one has a different purpose. We will take each one and go over possible frauds that occur from each phone number. These fraud examples can occur whether your phone is answered or not so it is recommended that your mobile device be configured to not answer calls from unknown numbers. Most of these phone are scams, as they are meant to make you give up your personal information that could be used to open a fraudulent account or give information about you that criminals can use to steal. Many of them ask for your social security or other important account numbers such as your debit card account number and pin number (if you use one).
One of most common types is what I call ‘The Nigerian Scam‘. They will call you and ask that they have money wired to them by Western Union or MoneyGram in order for them to help you with a situation that is out of control. One thing they will tell you is if you send them the wire that will happen. In many instances, they don‹t ask the recipient of a wire transfer for permission to send. So it can be difficult to tell if the fraud will ever happen or it will"

Example Sentence: - ""Are you okay?"" - (Context: Someone walks by you and you ask if they are okay or if something is wrong) - This might be a better way to ask someone if all is well.Example Sentences: How about we try that again.. (It sounds better when it's spoken out loud, and the words make more sense to you if you read this. It's a way of telling a person that you don't think there's anything wrong with what they're saying.) - That's what I was afraid they were saying. (An exclamation that expresses a strong feeling.) (The person who uses this phrase often wants a certain outcome. This person could use ""What do you want?"" to tell a different person how to behave or do something better.

I would like to know if anyone out there had the experience of being denied service somewhere and after it was said that they did not accept a credit card. My case was that, we were in a restaurant and we did accept my credit cards, the waiter had a conversation with one of the managers and he told us that we can't accept the credit from our credit because we have had some problems before, or something like that and then he said something about how we should bring the card if we want that it might work.

576,Can I Use App To Freeze Account And Dispute Fraud?,Considering this utterance: Can I Use App To Freeze Account And Dispute Fraud? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? The word ""Can"" implies a direct and affirmative command. The use of the preposition ""I"" means that the speaker is giving permission to something.

There are many different methods on how to do this. If the scammer is on a chat or text message channel, you can try: I need a bank statement from account xxx and I will get it back to you asap. Then you ask the victim for their current password. You then change their password with the new one. In any case, it's a scam!
So now, if you're on the phone or online with someone or some app, be on your guard. Don't give out your personal info - even if it seems like someone is ""tricking"" you - or they might use that against you. When you meet someone, meet somewhere safe and only where there is a record of people. For example, a McDonald's isn't safe, and you probably don't want to meet at the bar. Do have fun though!"

578,"Someone Has My Card Number, Freeze My Account.","Considering this utterance: Someone Has My Card Number, Freeze My Account. What is the intent that best describes it?","?

A:
[Explanation:]
I will answer your question based on the context.
In this sentence: 
Someone Has MY Card NUMBER & Freeze MY ACCOUNT..
someone is not the intended listener. This means that person will not be the target of the sentence. It is directed to someone else, not you!
This would mean ""someone has my card number"" or ""my card has been stolen"" is used in this situation. ""freeze my account"" means you have money in your account, and I am not sure if this will stop or prevent someone from getting money, but your money will be ""frozen until I unfreeze it (get money).

The intent of that utterances is pretty straightforward: ""I see random purchases appear to my account. Was it because of something that I have done?"".
But is it accurate? Does anyone really think that when I see a random purchase, it was actually because I did something.
I would argue that the speaker is probably saying: There is nothing wrong with my bank, so it must be something wrong that has triggered a charge to that account, that is something I don't know and would like to know what, and I am asking for you to tell me and if you can. 
Or perhaps: Please tell the bank how I can help and be the best customer you will possibly have."

A. I have the wrong card.
B. Someone used my card and probably doesn't have my permission. 
C. The store's credit card machine was not working. But someone stole it. (this might be a valid interpretation of option B)

F. What are you implying I should do next? (the store) [F is probably an error for A, the most likely interpretation is that the speaker wishes to know to use what information is available to identify the suspect, and ask the person to be apprehended.]"
581,How Do I Freeze My Card Using The App?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Freeze My Card Using The App? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The most important part is that this is a question about the sentence as it is, not the topic. You are asking how this sentence should be structured. It should not be asked on the Topic. There is no reason to tag this as an example to a topic on ""How to use the app"" because there is nothing to discuss on this topic as of yet.
Here is an extract from a previous post by a person who has written this exact sentence:
How do the card freezes using app or is it just that? Is there a difference with card type? or the phone used and card froze? I would like to know how does the freezing works or if there would be some explanation? Thanks
I think that what makes this question a good question is because it has the word question in the title, it can be easily answered on a technical basis but the person is still hoping for an answer based on their personal preferences and what is best for their situation. That makes it a Good Question for StackExchange instead of a bad question based in opinion."
582,My Card Has Been Compromised,Considering this utterance: My Card Has Been Compromised What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
This is a very simple question. The key is to understand what the phrase actually SAYS!
The phrase as I used it above, actually means: 
I am going to call and tell you that my credit card has been compromised. I want you to know about it right this second.
But if we break it up into a few more complete sentences, we can find what I think is an important clue to this question, and that is - ""How can I contact you?""
That phrase doesn't actually say anything about what you intend to tell someone, does it?   And I'm guessing that the real questions here, is how do I phrase the information that I need to give, so that it will help me contact the proper people to help correct this problem? and the answer to that, may be: ""Call me right now, my card may soon expire and I can't risk it.""
So now look at what this phrase means. It's like someone's saying  -
""Hi, this is Bill, I don't have a telephone, but here's my email address. Would you please contact me, right away so I may tell my wife to cancel my cards? I'll be back on the telephone by Monday morning, or maybe sooner if it's really bad. Thank you."""

The only intent you could possibly imagine being expressed in one word is I, which I will call I1 in order to distinguish it from subsequent examples.
[1] I think that someone else may have used my card, so I want to check. What should I do? I2 [2] When I got home, I looked at my mail and saw a large envelope from the IRS. I was shocked because it must have been sent to me by mistake. So, to be on the safe side, rather than call them to report the error, how should it be handled? [3] There was only one bill, but that made me nervous so in an attempt to reassure myself, and perhaps also the person who might be in trouble, because there were no tax returns due this year, what should happen? What if the one who sent the bill to my address was someone from a business that I had recently hired to perform a job? Then to the best of my knowledge, no business entity had yet made a payment. The only bill that had been mailed was for money I owed. [4] The police arrived while I still had my wallet and purse in my hand. When questioned, they asked, Do you think there may a crime committed? Should they be told what I thought about the matter? Or, should the police first confirm that no crime is in fact being committed, before they tell me that they think I may need to call the State Attorney General's office? How would that be done before, while, after, as I am doing it, in person, by phone, etc.. [5] It was raining and cold. Because of the wind and the rain combined with the cold, the trees are swaying and a few of them have fallen. They will all have to come off the fence and I don't know who's responsibility that will be. It occurred to some of us, that with all the people in town, someone may want the extra space to park or leave their car and that could be dangerous. Is the first part correct? That someone will want more parking room because the weather is bad. If so, then is it appropriate for us to do this, i.e., remove the fallen trees so that the car or people who are parked"

What is the intent that best describes it?",", and why? (For more info see: What are “tenses” in sentences?)

I don’t remember exactly what I said. But I think I was trying to say that ‘all of the transactions showing up on my monthly bill were strange, to me‗or that they were somehow suspicious because they didn‘t fit into any of my past billing statements.
The only reason why I could explain the ”transactions“ (which I have never made a habit of describing as transactions) was that I must have had more than one credit card at that time, because my other card, which I‟m sure I had used, showed up in the history of transactions on a statement from two-weeks prior. I don't remember what card I used in February, it might be the one that showed the strange transactions. It„s possible it was one of two or maybe more that was used to get this statement, or that it‚s one and the other is being used now. _______________________
1. This is not a very good title; it should say something like „The Strange Transactions On My Monthly Bill‏. ‏
2. A better title would be ‚I was just wondering if you could look at these strange monthly transactions that happened recently, for me to see if it makes any sense.‹ ‬
3. In the following sentence, the best way to express ’to me?‌ is with a comma rather than †a question mark. You can use ‡a period after an interrogative phrase (›who? or ′what? etc); the punctuation of ‖to/for/at me (in this case) is left to the reader."
585,How Do I Freeze My Account?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Freeze My Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A) A description of a process.
B) An explanation of an idea or a fact. (This is how it is typically used).
C) Request a change or something that is already in progress
D) Description of the results of some action. This does not make sense as it can be expressed with a verb. It would more likely be, “How do I make my account frozen?” as opposed to, How do you freeze your account?  
E) Statement of what something is (e.g. How cold is it? Or, how long does it last?)  This is a bit of misdirection and it doesn’t actually have to do with the question asked.  It could be stated as,  How long will my frozen account be frozen for? And then answer the next question. There isn‘t any other way to word your statement to have it fit with your question so the answer becomes How does the account become frozen (not how do they freeze the customer‟s account)?  In order to make your sentence fit the context of your situation (customer‚s frozen  account), the way you word it needs to be in accordance with what you are saying."
586,"I'M Not Certain, But Someone May Be Using My Card.","Considering this utterance: I'M Not Certain, But Someone May Be Using My Card. What is the intent that best describes it?","?

I don't understand how someone can answer that. I'm assuming it's a question of whether it is a simple or compound sentence. My assumption is that the answer to that is no one is using my card, therefore the sentence is simple and the question is, is someone using it? However if they have multiple cards, then it must be a compound.
If it were a one card statement, how would you respond if a statement was like
""There's someone here who doesn't know me but uses my bank card.""
would this have to do with simple/compound? I would think compound because I assume it could be true for multiple people. But if it can be either, which is correct? 
Is there something different I need to look at for questions? It's just that I've found answers on that in some instances where the questions are worded differently.   Thanks!

UPDATE
It appears that they just don´t understand grammar? If someone is doing something with your card without you or someone you know knowing, that's fraud. That's what's being asked there. In this case, the statement is in question form, since the person asking is trying to figure out if its true. Hence, I see two forms to respond to. ""I am not certain"" or ""Someone"

Is the phrase ""How Do i..."" the right one? Why? It would look like a question like 'How do I...', as in 'Where can I...?', 'Why can't I...', etc.

I am not looking to get an answer like, ""Use an expletive!"" because there could be a valid situation like this. I am just looking for the answer. 
Thanks. Please help!
Update 1:
Based on what I thought the question was, the first answer seems to be the closest one. However, it is a common phrase in the English language and should be asked in a grammar forum. Thanks! This is what it was supposed to mean. ""I want to know why the card cannot be frozen, not what to do about it.""
The second answer is similar to this one, but not exactly. And it seems the second answers is not the best one for this question. It is actually a very long story. But the title says ""Freeze"" not ""Froze"". ""My card is frozen!"" not simply ""my card"". If I want the ""frozens out"" card to make online transactions, then I would use ""freeze my cards"". Thanks to @GiorgioMazzotta. Anyway, my post is more than the scope of this forum and I have to post it in another forum to ask the questions about ""how cards can be  frozen"" or ""card frozen"". Thank you everyone. The second one was a bit of a mess. This was my fault, so I'll give the bounty as suggested by @michael-sql-server, @keshav and many others. My fault.

What Do I Do Now?,Considering this utterance: I Think Someone Got My Card Details And Used It Because There Are Transactions I Don'T Recognize. What Do I Do Now? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The best phrase would be:
'I think a thief got my card details and used them.'
But, you might want to be more specific.
For example, if this happens to you more than once (i.e. a number of times you're not aware of and then you learn your card is compromised), what should you say? I.E,
""I believe someone stole my credit card and spent several amounts on my account that I didn't authorise.""
Or
""...someone stole and/or attempted to steal my [insert your type here]:
- creditcard;
+ card number/bank account; and
~ money on your account and I do not recognize any transactions on it."" (I'm not sure if you can list more types here, I just picked these two because they were what I was thinking of.)

590,I Believe Someone Is Using My Card Without My Agreement!,Considering this utterance: I Believe Someone Is Using My Card Without My Agreement! What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I believe that an event is taking place that requires intervention and will lead to a resolution to the problem if it’s not acted on quickly.
If there is a question in how the event came to pass or if your intervention might be of benefit in resolving the issue, then your statement needs to be more specific, and your intent must convey that you are not merely a bystander but someone who is in a position to affect the outcome. A simple “I think” would be appropriate. (And this does not mean that ‘you‘ would not be included, as you clearly are, but your use of the word „that“ makes it clear that your intention is to convey something other than mere opinion.)
The ‚I know‚ does the opposite: it expresses a state of knowing, rather than an intent. Someone who ’knows„ is an expert in something, while someone ”knOWS.‟ is not an authority on a topic. There are other words with similar meanings, including ‭belief,‭ ‬believe, believe, think, suspect, understand, know, guess, assume, sense, etc., all with subtly different connotations. And there are also other, less common words, like ‫predict, infer, discern, determine, deduce, surmise, figure, realize, discover, conjecture that are very close in meaning, some being stronger than the others and some having slightly different nuances. The important point is that no matter what the words are used, one of three things is required:
You need to specify how you think you know or you need an opinion in regard to your knowledge, or else the person that hears it may be confused as to whether you meant †know‬ or ‪know that . It seems very likely to me that most, if not all, people that use the term ‖I‖ (rather than ″I don›) would mean the latter meaning. Thus, you want to choose another word. If you do choose  I KNOW, there‰s no way you can use it to express the idea of ‡someone․ is using my card without my agreement‡, unless you have an actual card and it has been signed or unless"
591,"If I Feel Someone Has My Card Information, Can I Get A New Card?","Considering this utterance: If I Feel Someone Has My Card Information, Can I Get A New Card? What is the intent that best describes it?","(a complete idea or concept) or a short sentence? In this case the phrase is composed of two clauses, and in a simple sentence each sentence is a clause. So, the idea expressed by this phrase in this context is one of three things.

1. To request that the card issuer change the details of my existing card. The intent is that if one has my information, one does not need to have this card issued, so why not change them?
(This one is used all the time and it is not wrong, even when the issuer is different from the one to which that card is issued. If you ask for a new card, you don't usually mean, ""please change my old card to this new issuer."")
2. I am worried that someone has accessed my card and they might be trying to use this information to steal money from me. For this reason it would be a very good idea to get a replacement card immediately. This one can be used even if the old issuer has changed too. It just depends on the context. In the above sentence, it could only be applied to the first one; the second would suggest an entirely other kind of action. Here are a few examples:
a) If someone uses your credit card without your permission to buy things or take things from a store or from some place else, what they have done is theft. Theft is very different, in that it involves physical property and not just your card information. (But, if you think someone might have stolen your money, get the report from your bank, go to your insurer, or go straight to local law enforcement. See ""What is Credit Card Theft"" in the ""Crimestoppers"" section below. And, always call the police if someone is threatening you with physical violence. There is nothing illegal about using a false identity to make your point.)
b) The first clause is more about protecting your identity than it does about your property. Identity theft is where one uses someone else's identity without permission, usually in order to obtain a credit report or credit history. These are available for public inspection, to see if there are any bad debts or unpaid judgments or other items of bad news that might appear on your profile.

It seems quite clear what the speaker of the sentence is trying to convey, ""I don't recognize the transactions on my account"", or ""There are a few transactions I don’t recognize"". This is a very strong and clear-cut message that's easy to communicate. I would say that there is no ambiguity that can be resolved in this sentence, as it's clear in its meaning.

The ambiguity is in the fact that the transaction may have happened before or after the date of ""the statement"".
If you had said ""my statement shows a payment of $50 and I haven't been able to find any record of that"", then that statement, by itself, could be ambiguous in that ""statement"" could refer to a statement from a previous date, in which case you would have to go back and look at the records to verify the payment. ""The statement indicates"" would resolve that ambiguity because it makes it clear that it refers to the statement on the page. It's not possible to look into the past in order to make things unambiguous because the information we have is limited. We can only look to what is presented on paper, and the paper trail can take us back only so far - if we want to know about something, we must go forward in time. You can try to tell me that I shouldn't worry about it, but the thing that worries me is that if I'm not sure, then it is easy for people to steal from me. That's why the rules of law exist - to try and prevent that. The ambiguity exists because in practice, you can't resolve it because there isn't enough information to resolve any questions. But since it isn‘t possible for you to access what I have or not, your question is moot. -Kev

a) To find out which person(s) have access to my credit card numbers.

d) Someone with access has done something. It's not clear who that person was. But there are a couple of possibilities: the card number or the account number was stolen, or an access violation was done. Perhaps the thief was just able to read a few digits of the number. Or, if an attack is done using the same method that was used by a previously determined attacker, someone else might have obtained the correct information to use that method.

595,What Do I Do If I Think Someone Managed To Get My Card Information?,Considering this utterance: What Do I Do If I Think Someone Managed To Get My Card Information? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The most common answer is “I want you to help me get my card number back.” What this means is that it has been lost. It means there has to be a problem with the card. The person is in trouble and wants to have the problem solved.
It means that what happened was a breach and the information has probably been obtained by the attacker. They now have enough information to perform future attacks against the customer. Or, they are just trying to make some money. Either way you have a bad situation that needs to get dealt with. And, this is a common problem that is getting more common. We now see breaches on cards that are not even in customers hands. If a business is breached, it could be in the news within minutes. That means the business owner is having to respond to the attack within hours. This may mean the person has the most important part of their business stolen and there is very little a person can do about it. So, we need to figure out how to protect ourselves and make sure we get all the cards in our hands before the attackers get them. Because the breach is bad enough that the company may be sued and, in many cases, the individual is subject to criminal penalties. Now that we have an understanding of breach, let’s look at the second common response. ”I hope the hacker is not able to use the stolen card to spend or charge anything. I don‘t want to find out after I make big purchases. You have my consent to call me back after the investigation is finished. Thank you. Here is my phone number. Have a nice day. How are we doing so far? I think we are beginning to understand the problems that customers face every time they get their cards stolen. But, where is breach in this conversation? We know that there are risks associated with having your card stolen, but we don't know if what the victim says will work in their favor. There will be cases where the risk is low, other times it is high and sometimes it goes out into the middle. To understand what is going on, what we do and do not need, and how we can best respond, then we go to our data, our information and our systems.

597,What Should I Do If I Think Someone Is Using My Card.,Considering this utterance: What Should I Do If I Think Someone Is Using My Card. What is the intent that best describes it?,"? I would choose: I think someone is using my card.

Why?
Because this phrase clearly indicates that the speaker thinks someone else was the one using the credit card, and that is clearly the purpose and objective of this expression. The other person might not know anything about this; it just seems weird to me that someone thinks another person used their credit cards or debit cards. This phrase is a good one to use if you are concerned about someone who is not paying bills that they owe. If you want to say this, your expression should be as close to this as possible: It just appears to be someone using someone’s card!
(This is also the phrase I tend to hear when someone uses their card in a store to make a purchase and there is someone standing behind the register. Someone will come up behind them and say, “Hey are you using his card?”
)
When someone asks this: ‘Who Used My Credit Card? Is It Possible I Was Mischarged? Or Someone Else Used it.‘
Is it possible that I was mischarged. It isn‚Äôt possible. You cannot be charged for using your own credit or bank card and you don“t use someone other„s credit for the same reason you wouldn‛Åt eat food someone has prepared for you and leave the container on the shelf. And you can only be mischarge for something that you purchased. But then that person would need to know the card number to find out who used it to charge you. Or you could check with the store who sold you that product about how to dispute charges, but that would depend on where it was bought. (And it‟s a bit late in the dispute process, as it may already have been processed before it is caught, so you‏d want this to get there as fast as you possibly can).
There are only a handful of ways someone can be the person using a credit/debit card they did not purchase. There is no possible way they could ever be. When they ask this question, they clearly do not want that to apply to them. So in my opinion there―re two ways they can ask their question:

598,Can I Use App To Freeze My Card And Dispute Fraud?,Considering this utterance: Can I Use App To Freeze My Card And Dispute Fraud? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

(1 word) This is a common use of the phrase.
[Example: I need to stop my card from being frozen so I can dispute my charge.]
It is used in cases where the use has an implication of an immediate result. That would make the expression seem like a command, and it can be used either with or without a verb, but the meaning in these cases will be the same. In cases like these, a simple statement can also be an appropriate alternative. For example, if you are trying to use your phone card to call someone at another phone company, then ""Can I use my phone in New Jersey?"", is an equivalent. And if someone just said, ""What's the fastest way to get to JFK?"" then this is another alternative to ""How do I get from here to there?""
In the first example from the paragraph I provided, I would say ""I want to freeze my credit so that if there is any fraudulent activity on my account, the credit is frozen and I will not spend any more without being able to be sure that the charge is valid."" That is more appropriate to the situation than the other two examples because this statement is not a direct command. I have stated my needs, now I expect that you will help. You can either use that phrase or use either of those in that situation. If you choose to say, ""[I need] to have my cards frozen"" it will sound more like an order, so be careful with it. However, it would be just fine in this situation, with a slight change of words: The words ""want"" are replaced by the words, 'need.'
For some reason, when I first started writing this answer, someone had provided a sentence that did not include the word 'to' between the verb phrase and the adverb phrase as in the sentence ""Do you want it on blue or green plates?"" That sentence seems to imply that there are two choices, or that I am saying ""do [you] want"" [them] on one choice or the [other]."" If this were said at a restaurant, this would imply I want you to put it in your mouth or in my belly button. It would also imply an offer and a response. Instead, what if I responded, [Yes]/[No]? This has no"

What do you make of that? You've been thinking about it and it is making sense. You have the gist of it. If you had to write this sentence in a form of three words, what would they be? How would a simple sentence of two or three nouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives change it? What could an adjective describe? And what could a preposition be describing? A phrase, a clause or perhaps an independent sentence? This is a very simple form. How simple are we talking? Try it on paper, on a computer. See how you can make it simpler or more complicated depending on how easy or difficult it appears as you read. Can you write a sentence that expresses this same gist with a word other than I? Yes, it can be. But, the meaning of the original is more precise by its being simple and having a single person as the subject of this expression. In some cases, an object can change the expression of a statement with I. What if you were the one that did not want to use or pay the bill? Would your sentence sound simpler by changing the pronoun? Or, is it not as simple as that, because what we really see is that the first I is using another I to express an intent to take action? In this case the I has no meaning. This sentence also is about one person. Another example is, ""I'm taking an action with this I,"" or, with another form, ""...the I does the action."" This I takes action as does someone else, and this person is not the person who is expressing this intent, although it also could be that this is an example of another person that is in my I's shoes. Does the second person I, as someone doing the same act and the third person doing it, make the statement simpler, less complicated? It might depend on the case and how we"
600,Do All Atms Take This Card?,Considering this utterance: Do All Atms Take This Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"that have a meaning and are not just random syllables? I think its: ""Do All atms take this CARD? "" which would be a statement with a clear subject and a predication. I have an image that is a card that all atm's take. Its like a passport for your atp, the atps are in charge, but they need your permission to operate and your credit, if you dont have it, then they will let you go. But if your good and on time, they let your card run for a longer time. Then if the card starts failing, its because you werent good. You could get the same result if a person wasnt using a credit card, and the bank just kept making new ones.

This is why people say theres too many atmt's. We can't handle the load. It's all about supply and demand. So if there are too much cards, it will be hard for more customers to get cards. The bank has a limit to how much it can produce. If all of the cards are produced then it wouldnt be able to fulfill any new customers cards that are needed and they would loose their customers
. In short, there is not enough of a good at the moment, so the supply of cards has got to be reduced, to increase the demand, which in turn will allow more good cards to come and then more people can have them."
601,Which Atms Accept This Card?,Considering this utterance: Which Atms Accept This Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? And does this same intent have a different intent when it becomes a sentence?

This is a rather easy exercise of analysis to do.
It's just that a little more thought must be given if a more complex or abstract sentence is encountered. This sentence:
The man is dead
is also an acceptable exercise. Which of these phrases best indicates the intended meaning? Is it: The man, is, dead? Or is it The, the, man,,,is,, dead. Or perhaps The is not needed. We'll just call it is and the man dead for brevity's sake. (You should know by now that when I say is in a question mark, it means ""is"".)
What about: ""I would love to have the money."" This is actually two separate sentences joined by a conjunction. Is the first sentence a single clause, or a complete sentence by itself? Can you say it that way? The conjunction here is ""would"", so you could break it up into two clauses: 1. I love money and I wish I had it, so I would like to. 2. Have it or have it get you. If this is broken up, what does the last statement tell you, if anything, about its intended subject? If ""have it"" was replaced by something else, does it then take the place of that clause? It is possible that is could be replaced simply by ""money"". But in that case, ""Have it,"" becomes the predicate (predicate meaning the main verb here being a verb) of the whole sentence. It would then be the only verb. The ""or"" and ""so,"" which are conjunctions, are not verbs. ""Or"" tells you that you can pick either ""get it"", or ""having it"". The second one is like having one's cake and eating it too, except that it may be a bit more confusing. You might have said ""Having it so that I could have money"". If you think about it in this way, you would say ""that I am have"" money, right? But is that the correct verb, and is have an auxiliary verb? I'll get to the auxiliary verbs later in the lesson. For now, I want you to be able to think in terms of whether ""The dog is on the mat"". Is this a noun phrase or is this"
602,Where Is The Closest Mastercard Atm?,Considering this utterance: Where Is The Closest Mastercard Atm? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

This is actually a common question for many of our English learners who want to know where to ask for an ATM. Many of them might be looking for the ATM that offers the quickest service when they are going abroad or just looking to withdraw money as soon as possible because they might want or need to make an urgent purchase, especially if they have a credit card to use at the bank. However, this post is for those of you who are looking where you can find the closest MasterCard ATM because you also need some cash that you will need when you are traveling.
In this short article, you’ll learn some helpful tips for how to find Master Card ATMs. Let‘s start off with some basic ATM information that will help you get the most out of it for your trip.


The first thing you have to do before looking through for where the nearest MasterCards ATM is, if you want the fastest service, is knowing your bank‟s phone number and its hours of operation. You can usually call up your local branch and the customer service number of any bank and ask them for ATM service details. The bank will also be able to provide you the phone numbers of all its ATM terminals. So all you need, before you start looking on where is closest masterCard atm, are the numbers that banks usually put on their ATM screens. These usually include the type of ATM (eg ATM card vs. ATM cash withdrawal, ATM with internet banking services) and also the telephone (and email) number that should be used if the user wants to send instructions to the machine. For instance, Mastercards usually have the following numbers or addresses:
Bank: Master card
Phone: (xxx)xxx-xxxx
Address: xxxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxxxx
Email: mastercard@mail.com
For the ATMS that have telephone numbers, users should know how the phones should work and if there are any toll-free numbers. If your phone is international, it is usually recommended that Master‚Äôs ATM have an area code from the country that your ATM terminal is located in. This can help people know if that particular ATM serves people from overseas as well. Remember, for international Master Ccard users, all phone calls will be charged to a foreign country, so be sure that the Master ATM"

For example the following: Do you know any ATM machines that can accept cash cards as payment? A. Is there a list of these? or B. I need a ATM machine that accepts cash. In this example, we are not really interested in the list; rather, the main intent is to request the speaker to provide information or direct his or her search effort towards something.

In this section there are some common questions about the meaning of a simple question and answer. For more information on the questions in this chapter, go to this website. The best answers to questions 1 and 2 in most cases depend on your level of knowledge. A very simple answer to question #1 would be ""yes."" You do not need to know anything more than that. This can be your first answer or even just a yes. You may be tempted to think that knowing is a key component and a good answer, but this is not necessarily true. If you are unsure of your answer and not sure if it is correct, then you may want to ask the question. There are two main types of questions: yes-no questions and opinion questions. Yes-No questions are when you ask someone if they know about something by saying either ""do you?"" or ""don't you?"". Opinion questions, on other hand involve the person's judgment as to whether something is true or false, rather than what is known or unknown. Here, is there is only the choice between the yes, no and maybe. These can also be called open-ended questions because you can answer with more detail if you like. To answer this type question, you don;t need any knowledge, only a little bit of time to answer properly. When in doubt, take your time!

605,How Do I Know Which Atms Will Accept This Card?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Know Which Atms Will Accept This Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? What kind of feeling do you have when hearing or reading the phrase? If I were a card maker, what would be the best card to create with that phrase on it?

It’s not the question itself, but the way in which we approach the questions that matter. I‘ve been working on this for the past two months (at least), and I still can“t seem to get it to sit right, and it”s killing me not to release a product.
As a creative, the things I create (artwork, poetry, etc.) can be a way to help people cope with their own issues or problems. So I want to know what you think: Do you like this idea? Why do think it is relevant? Does it make sense to you? Do the words feel natural to the voice I am trying to emulate? And finally, if I could make this card, which words would you choose, or would choose you, in order to convey the sentiment and message you‟re trying for? Thanks so much. (I really want an “A+„ rating, even though you only get a „C+).
I know my writing isn t as eloquent as some people›s and even if it was, I couldn‹t afford to buy one of those high end stationary/card makers with fancy, professional paper. But I can type (or maybe I should say I WAS able to type) and, with a little bit of work, could put together a reasonably decent-looking card. The problem comes when I try to think of a message to go on said card that is in keeping with the message or sentiment of the original poem and also, when choosing the right words within that sentence. Any suggestions to try would greatly improve my card making abilities as well as help me learn how to better convey what I wanted to say. Thanks. -T.L.(PS. You‛re welcome for posting my question).  P.S. Sorry for not having the card with me today but, being a very introvert person, my cards are usually made at a later stage.

606,Which Atm'S Accept My Card?,Considering this utterance: Which Atm'S Accept My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

Intentions are hard to define, so I think it’s best to consider the word intent as simply a shorthand way of referring to the various ways one may think about an utterances‘ meaning. An uttering of a thought or an idea may have a variety of intents. The person may know their thoughts very well and have the thought already fully formed, the thoughts may be a response to a trigger, or they may simply be thinking and not even fully aware of what they will say, etc.
The same can be true about the phrasing of an intent or the order of the ideas in a sentence. We know what we want to express, but we can choose how to say it. This includes which parts of speech to use, and how they are to be combined. Sometimes it is easier to think of intent in its simplest form as an “I” and ” you“ constructions, like this:
""I love you""
‚ÄúI like that‹„›""you""‟Ë‛
or: ""I can‰¤‡‥‖'like‴‵″it‮‸´.‬‼
However, this is only a simplification of it and does not capture every way humans may talk about intentions and other mental states. For instance, we may also have an ""we"" construction: ‹•¦‭‾※′†'s‱… † ‘•. „ ‚••'―' ‰ ¢ ’• ″ • ""We like it when you smile at us,‏"". We can also say ›¥¡¨   ""He wants to go to France."" The words are the same but in this case the ""he"" is a pronoun referring not to an individual but to some entity or other: he may stand for the idea or concept of going to france, perhaps. So what does this ""go"" mean here? If we think more about what is happening, it seems more like the ′go‷ concept is being expressed here. It is possible that the intention here is to ask the listener to help him"
607,Is There Any Nearby Atm'S?,Considering this utterance: Is There Any Nearby Atm'S? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? And what about as part of a larger sentence?

A:
[1]
   -1 
B:  There's an ATM nearby [2].
(the word near by is implied)
This is a non-finite verb phrase, and there is always some ambiguity regarding what it modifies. It can have two possible meanings, depending on context: Either ""there is an ATMs nearby"" - as you have guessed it means ""is there one ATM near me?"" or ""Is there any ATm nearby?"" - in which case it could mean ""do you see any"" or it can mean something else, like ""what is on the other side of the street"". The choice of which meaning to take can depend on how you understand the question and what the context is (e.g. ""Do you know there are any nearby ATMS?"") or on what you assume the speaker means when they say the sentence (If, for example, they mean that ATM is some fixed entity, then the phrase ""nearby ATMr"" clearly doesn't make much sense; but I don't think this is necessarily what they intended).
Another issue is that in the above sentence there would also be ambiguities regarding who or what is being ""any"". Is ""ATM"" being interpreted as the ""one"" ATM that you ask about? Or as any ""many"" of them? Is it being used to refer more generically to all ATms, or to just some of those?"
608,Where Are The Locations Of Atms That Accept This Card?,Considering this utterance: Where Are The Locations Of Atms That Accept This Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

(i) To express the location of the ATMs where the card can be accepted.
- This is incorrect since ""of"" is not in the sentence in question. A better word would be where. The location is an adjective which modifies card, so that it is a place where ATMS are. If it was in a sentence like this one:
Where I live is
or even
The location where I work (at) is/is
it would make sense because it can't be a location without a specific person. But in this case, ""The place of ATM"" could be understood as being a general location such as ""the place"", not ""where"" like in ""Where do you live?""
However, if it said something like
""What is this location?"" would it make any sense? I don't think so.  
In this example, the question would likely be intended to ask the name of this ATM card. You see, a question starting with: ""What"" means that the following sentence is being asked for information. That, combined with this card's name, means it's asking for the definition of ""ATM"".
It's like asking ""what is"" in an English sentence, and then asking the object of that question to give you the meaning of it. So the answer is simply ""an ATM"", and it would work as such:  ""I don’t have AT&T. ATM is...""
Therefore: this phrase is asking where to find ATms. It could also be asking what they are, but the phrasing does not make this explicit: What are ATams?"
609,Which Atms Accept This Placard ?,Considering this utterance: Which Atms Accept This Placard ? What is the intent that best describes it?,"Considering this utterance: Which Atms Accept This Placard?. What is the intent that best describes it expressed as a phrase of one or two words, or a single sentence?

The Placerat's Intent: This atmo-thermal experiment uses this placard to measure the thermal properties of the Earth and the solar wind.
This experiment is being done as part of a series of studies, so the goal of this experiment isn't just to find out the properties...

610,Help Me Locate The Nearest Atm.,Considering this utterance: Help Me Locate The Nearest Atm. What is the intent that best describes it?,"? (1) I want you to find the nearest ATM and(2) Lend Me Some Money..?

I agree with you that we can find a few other phrases to describe what's asked in the above utterances:
1. Where's my money?
2. I need money.
3. What's the ATM code?  
However, in order to make your sentence valid you need to put the verb in its correct tense. And the sentence is missing the noun it would refer to. In other words, your sentences are in a state of ""noun + verb + noun"". You must change your statements to:  ""I want to help you locate the closest ATM"" & ""Lend me some money"".
There are several different grammatical rules about the use of the subject and object. The subject can never be changed by changing a verb, and vice versa. When it comes to ""locate"" in your case, the object is ""the closest"" or ""a ATM""."
611,What Atms Is The Card Okay To Use At?,Considering this utterance: What Atms Is The Card Okay To Use At? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I’ll tell you what: It‘s that you can use this card with Atm. So you could say, “What”. It could be the word ‘What? or ‚What Are You Doing?“. But that isn‚t what this question is about. Rather, this is a question about the use of that card. „So what? ” or even something like ’Why? Is it because I want to make you uncomfortable? If so, then I‬ ‬
•
would want you to be uncomfortable. The question here isn't about why you're uncomfortable, it's about how I intend to use the card in the situation. You're still the subject of the sentence, that's true, but it is asking a ""what?"" that is more focused than just asking why.
So in short, no, your phrase isn'[t grammatically correct, as in you haven't got the preposition that it needs at. However, if the question asks for the reason for that, or the intention of you asking, I think it'd be ok."
612,How Can I Find The Nearest Atm?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Find The Nearest Atm? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?



The best place to start is to read and think about some similar sentences and try to guess the meaning of this simple one. You might even make a few sentences like this to see how your brain reacts as you try and figure it out.
In particular the phrase “the nearest”. It could be that there is a single closest, or several, but you get the idea."
613,What Kind Of Atm'S Can I Use?,Considering this utterance: What Kind Of Atm'S Can I Use? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? In other words, what kind of atm's can I use? A. A question that requires more than one answer. B. An inquiry that is seeking an answer and asking a specific question. C. The same inquiry, but without the word ask. D. Both A and B, with no mention of the question being asked at all. Choose A or B:

614,How Can I Withdraw Money?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Withdraw Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Is this an example of the use of modal?

This is an interesting question, as I can’t tell by a couple of words exactly what I think you mean, but I‘ll take a stab at it. I do think I agree with @S.L. Barth, that the word “withdraw” suggests something rather more active than just ‘deposit“, which is what is actually intended by the question.
†
I think the best thing to do would be a simple google search, to see how others view things like this. If you can find a dictionary or something online that says „depoist„ or ‚depositive‟ or some such, it is clear what the intended meaning is. The ‑ist is a good clue, and I would expect you to go by context rather than looking at the first word in the phrase, because it wouldn‚Äôt be clear if we were talking about a deposit at a bank, or a withdrawal from a stock trading account, unless it was a special context of some sort I was unaware of. It‛Ås a very broad term that could cover both, however. 
† If there are a lot more words in that sentence it might mean something different, though. † But that ÀÞªs probably a separate question altogether."
615,How Many Miles Away Is The Atm?,Considering this utterance: How Many Miles Away Is The Atm? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?
I am asking because this phrase is a ""word"" in the dictionary and it means something:

distance, distance from a place, place of origin, from which you arrived or will take
  or make an intended trip, departure (of a person or place) or arrival. 
the act of travelling or of going
a place or thing (such as an animal) that you can see or reach by moving (as in going) towards it in a particular direction from one place to another
(a) a specified or fixed distance (usually specified in feet) (b) the number of such distances from the point of departure or point reached.
The number or distance of miles (the name for a unit of distance in many countries) between (some two places).
How many miles is it to that town?; What distance does that motorway take us to the center of London? How far is there from New Delhi to London and Paris?"

@Gazza, Gareth, and all, thank you very much! That's a terrific answer!
The ""Which..."" question sounds to me like a double-barreled question. The subject is ""Atms"" which is singular, while the predicate is asking a question about the class of objects which includes ""the AtMs"" or ""some AtM"".
So, I would say that the correct answer is that ""which"" is doublebarrel: ""all or some AtMS or one particular AtmA""
And ""what"" sounds like an ordinary question of two possible interpretations.
In your question, ""accepts"" suggests to you that he's asking you about ""Card"" as if the question would be about accepting cards at a particular ATM, or, accepting a certain type of card. So, the meaning I'm guessing at is, that his bank is accepting credit card payments and his question is which ones would allow him to pay by card at that ATM? ""What ATM(s) accept credit cards"" might be correct as an analysis of his intent, but that doesn't answer the ""how many ATM will I have to use"" question which he didn't actually ask. :)
Thanks again,
Mike.PS - If you want to play with these, you can try it here!http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/grammartips/phrasal-double-subject.aspx
PPS. Sorry, no, these are not really ""phrases"" for this purpose, as they do not consist of ""words"" that follow a predictable, consistent structure. They are, instead, two examples of sentences, where a single predicate (meaning) is followed by two subjects (words).
You need to take a look at the grammar and syntax of phrasal questions."
618,At What Atms Am I Able To Use The Card?,Considering this utterance: At What Atms Am I Able To Use The Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

1. A person can't understand why he is not able to use a card he has bought.
2. He does not know that he can use it to buy more products. 
3. His question shows that there is some confusion in his mind, and it does
not express an idea well. It is too abstract and is a question of logic. But it might not be appropriate in some other situations."
619,Can I Use My Card At Any Atms?,Considering this utterance: Can I Use My Card At Any Atms? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? This is a challenging task to get a clear idea about the context and what the speaker is trying to achieve. The context can be anything, but the most common example is that it can relate to financial transactions. This would mean that the phrase can have many contexts like the following:

Can I use my debit card at any ATM?
I'd like to withdraw money with my credit card
Is my card valid? Can't I withdraw any money now? etc...
But in this context, the best way to understand the meaning would be with a set of phrases that relate the concept of a transaction between a merchant and consumer. For example: The merchant provides an item for the consumer, and if the item is of high value, a cash refund may be applied to the credit for goods sold.
This is also one of the common scenarios for ATM use. When you walk into a store, or a restaurant, that sells products or services, you can pay for it by credit or debit using your card. You can also use your ATM card to access money from your own bank. In the example given above, we can say that: I pay my merchant using my money and my ATM allows me to use its money. If the merchant has already paid its suppliers, this would also mean the same concept. Here, I have paid the money for my goods and now I am using another method to spend that money using the ATM. It is very important to remember that these transactions occur in real time. Your ATM is not a place where people just leave money lying around. We spend money only when we physically make it available for use by other people. And this is why using an ATM has an implication that an interaction has occurred, since you are making money available to another person in a way that you do not make available."

In each task you will be given a short piece of information. This information represents a brief situation that might occur in real life. (Note: The information you are given will not be used in this exercise; it has been chosen just to give you a sense of what this type of task is all about.)
After you have completed each of the three tasks, you must write a sentence or phrase that represents your opinion of that situation. Write as if it were happening right now as you read this information:  

  In each assignment you can pick any two of these: can, can't, may, might, will, shouldn't (can),  cannot (cannot), may not (may), should not  (should  ).  For each one of them you need to write one sentence."

In the first phrase, the subject of the sentence is ""Accept"" but the object is implied. The second phrase indicates that both the person accepting the card and the one accepting it are equal partners.

Consider this other utter. ""What would be the impact of a decision to accept the atms in order to achieve your personal goals?
If you are able to answer these questions in a way that is convincing, then write a short essay on the topic. Remember, you have to express your ideas clearly in the context. Your essay topic must be specific, and you need to make the writing interesting. A topic such as ""My Life Goals"" might be a good place to start. You need a clear idea about your paper before you start writing. Make sure you think about what you want to say and have a firm understanding of what your main point will be. It is also helpful to know your purpose before beginning. Are you attempting to persuade the reader to agree with something? Or are you presenting information to inform? If you can't quite decide on a point, it could be an idea starter. But don't worry. As you write, your own ideas may emerge. If yours don' t, remember that there are always other people who have ideas that you might want, or that have the same purpose as you. Read what is written in this lesson carefully as there is no room for errors. Be patient and concentrate until the end. There's no time to waste.

622,Can Someone Please Assist Me With Finding My Nearest Atm?,Considering this utterance: Can Someone Please Assist Me With Finding My Nearest Atm? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

Here's my interpretation:
1) It's a request to get help.  You want someone to guide you through the process or tell you the location of a machine.
2)  It is also possible that the phrase is asking the question of your mother. She is saying ""someone please help me find my ATM.""
I'd like to hear any other ideas about the sentence. Thanks. :)
EDIT: In my country the ATM machine and the bank that contains one are referred to by the term ATM. It makes sense that if one is trying to find the nearest ATM, he or she would ask for someone who is ""helping"" him or her. So the ""me"" referred in the original post is a shortened form of me, meaning someone else. I hope that answers your questions!
Thanks again. The best is yet to come. :). -D
PS I am not a native English speaker (a Canadian) and I was not trying in any way to be impolite. My goal was to try to make myself understood. Sorry for any confusion. =o(=o)
PPS 
Thank you for taking the time to consider my question. -o/   I will close the thread soon so you don't have to answer to my ""impatient"" question if you prefer. :(  Thank you. (: -3D. Bye."
623,Are There Any Atm Machines Near Me?,Considering this utterance: Are There Any Atm Machines Near Me? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A sentence of only one word (a phrase with no meaning) is an oxymoron.
An atm machine does not exist, it's an impossibility. It can never be done. If there was any such thing it would be in an atmsense. A sense is a type of consciousness that has a certain meaning. Atmsenses can have different types and meanings. You don't have a single atma sense or type. That would mean at that point there is only a consciousness of ""consciousness"". That is impossible, a thing like that would no longer exist if it were to be realized. The consciousness would have changed from a state that is ""in"" it to what is realized and what happens. This consciousness could not be a part of the atman, as the part is already the whole. So you would still just be consciousness, not a true atmansense which in turn would not even exist. In short there are no atmenesses because there exists no consciousness. There exists just no-consciousnes. All that exist are the individual noatma senses."
624,Where Is The Nearest Bank Machine?,Considering this utterance: Where Is The Nearest Bank Machine? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
The main intent is to ask to where you have access to a bank machine. For example, if you are in a remote town or town with not many banks or ATMs and your cell phone service does not support GPRS, you can use SMS messaging to get information on how to open a new account and how best to transfer money.
So, I believe that the two-word utterances are grammatically correct, but the meaning is a little bit strange. I think that a more appropriate uttering sentence would be something like: ""Where is [the] closest [bank]?"""
625,What Type Of Atms Accept This Card?,Considering this utterance: What Type Of Atms Accept This Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The following is an exercise in analyzing the utterances in one of my texts (I will not provide the entire text).
I am looking for examples of:
A) Utterances that clearly express that a specific type AAtm has accepted the card.
B) Examples of phrases that seem clear, to the eye, but can mean another type of Atm is accepting the Card
C) What other type(s) of utterancers exist for this kind of intent? For example, a card might be issued in the name of a type BAtms, who are clearly of that type. The speaker is not aware of the specific details (or perhaps they are aware, and are trying to keep it secret), but there are some facts that indicate they have a good reason for being so specific about who can or cannot accept the given card? 
This example seems to be a case of B, although the speaker may very well be of Type A. I'd like to learn the correct term and a few examples. If you know how to find this out, I would appreciate it as well. Thanks in advance!
""The card is for you.""
Here, it seems pretty clear that the Speaker is speaking of someone of type 'A'. I believe this is type I.   However, there is a possibility that this person is of an earlier type, which they do not recognize, or at least, is aware that it is possible that someone that is more of their type could accept it. So I am trying a bit harder to understand whether this example is clearly one where type IA is being used. In this case, type II or III would work. Or in this instance could it be type IV, if this speaker does not know the type (the card has been given to someone who is unknown to them and is only known because the owner has used that card before)?
For the sake of clarification, in an instance where a speaker clearly understands that they cannot tell others (for any reason) that an Atman has received the same card, do we say that speaker was using A or B? What about C in instances like this? Could it apply to any Atma who accepts the Atam card in his/her name? In the above instance, the person accepting this card would have the ability to reject it, because"
626,Where Can I Use This Card At An Atm?,Considering this utterance: Where Can I Use This Card At An Atm? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

What is your best guess of an answer to the above question? Why would your prediction be better than mine?"
627,"If I Have This Card, Which Atms Can I Go To?","Considering this utterance: If I Have This Card, Which Atms Can I Go To? What is the intent that best describes it?","?
I believe the best way to express the intention is ""Can"". It can also mean ""I can"" or ""If I am capable of"". The best translation of ""Which Atm can I go to?"" is 'Which one of these ATM can be my destination?' (In my opinion).
Here are some other ideas:

A: ""When I have this card, can/which ATM will I be able to use it?""
B:  ""What is/are the ATM that are/the Atmos that I/you can use to withdraw money?"""
628,What Atms Can I Withdraw Money From?,Considering this utterance: What Atms Can I Withdraw Money From? What is the intent that best describes it?,", with no grammatical errors?

Is it an affirmative statement of fact that something is true? The question is to describe a specific instance, of something that has occurred. Is it a statement that the speaker believes is correct? It is a fact about something the person says, but the statement does not make it into the mind of the listener or reader. Can it be an observation or a report of a thing as it has transpired, a comment or opinion, rather than fact? Is there something in the words that suggest an expression of belief, an opinion that is not stated? If we remove some of its words from the sentence, what happens? What becomes of it? Does it still make sense? Can you still tell what is meant? How can we determine its meaning? A question about the grammar of sentences? This is about Sentence Structure.

629,"I Want To Withdraw Money, Where Can I Go?","Considering this utterance: I Want To Withdraw Money, Where Can I Go? What is the intent that best describes it?","?: A: To withdraw money for personal purposes; B: to borrow money and repay the loan; C: In order to withdraw or receive money, I must present a credit card. Which of these is more probable?: I would think that it is B. This is because it seems to me that in A, the person expressing this intention intends to spend the money that he or she possesses, either for him or herself or on someone else. If it were intended that the expression of such an intention should result in the withdrawal and/or receipt of money by the one who speaks it, then I believe that a more adequate description would be A.

A: The intent is to obtain money from an individual, usually a bank, for the purpose of spending it. I am not sure why there is a comma in there. That sounds like a question, or is it an incomplete thought?
B: It's the best that I can think of. The speaker intends borrowing someone or something else's money to pay him (and it sounds very much like him) back. There is usually no reason to have such funds on hand in a savings account. Also, to use credit cards is not the way to go for one that is just starting out. They can be useful for short-term purchases, and can even help with some small-ticket purchases that would otherwise be too large a purchase to handle on cash. But, as you point out, not for a person that has some funds in his account to draw on. So B is really the only option. Maybe C, but I doubt very strongly that this is what the speaker is doing."

This utterances has the following parts:
Where can I withdraw (a) my money.
My money (b) is at (c) the bank. (d)
I (e) withdraw my (f) money from (g) a bank (h) in my country. There are many other possibilities. Which are the most correct options? Explain why or why not. This is an exercise of Etymology and Rhetoric."
631,What Are The Atms That Will Accept This Card?,Considering this utterance: What Are The Atms That Will Accept This Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? The answer is: a rhetorical question. That is rhetorical because it cannot be answered. It does not have a clear-cut, direct answer. For this reason, many people do not answer it.

What are the atms that will accept this card?
That is a question we must answer as best as we can because we will never know the answer unless you ask. We can only answer because of the questions that come from you asking for our advice. However, there is only one answer for you to give. Your choice must come only from your desire to do as you believe the Spirit is leading you. You cannot have any other answer other than what you choose and what makes YOU happy. If you try to answer your question as if you knew what the answers were, you will only be disappointed."
632,What Atms Will Accept This Type Of Card?,Considering this utterance: What Atms Will Accept This Type Of Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

1. To define or describe what will accept what type and class of card. ""What will an ATM accept for a PIN?""
2. Conveying the idea that the card will not be accepted for any of the reasons which may be used to describe the intended type of ATM.
3. Explaining why a card may not work at an intended ATM with an example."
633,Where Can I Find An Atm To Use This Card?,Considering this utterance: Where Can I Find An Atm To Use This Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

This would be easy if I were looking for the answer ""a place where you can find ATM machines to use this card"", but that's not the way it is. The question here is about the ""ATM"". This would mean that the first part of the phrasal verb ""Where can I find an ATM"" is ""where can"" and ""I find"". And the last part should be ""an ATM"". Thus, the correct answer is probably ""the bank"".
Here's an example of this type of question: Which of these sentences best expresses the intended meaning of ""When is it better to have more choices of things to do than to spend time with a specific task?"":
A. I want to find out which one has more options.
B. It would have been better for me if she could find a job. (not good)
C. More tasks would allow me to keep an eye on her. [good]
D. They are all equally good. ([good])
The question asks about ""tasks"" which, in this case, are things we do for a living. A task is an action we perform at certain intervals, and usually there is some kind of a deadline at the end of that action. In this example the task would need to be something we can keep ""doing in order to watch her"". The most common thing we use for that is a ""job"" but in fact any task you have that you ""keep up with"" would work. ""Watch"", in the sense of being ""on the lookout for things"" or of checking something ""every once in a while"" to see if it's going as planned or not, is also a task. We need a new task when we're ""busy doing some other things with our lives"", because we are ""keeping an ear out for what we have to pay attention to"". So you could also ask yourself the question, ""What is she keeping an ""eye on""?"".
""To find"" has a much broader meaning than ""to find something"" (a physical thing). To look for something would include ""searching for it"", ""finding it"" among others. When we ""look for"" something, we may also ""find it"". But we also might come ""across"" it. Sometimes we might just"
634,At Which Atms Can I Use This Card?,Considering this utterance: At Which Atms Can I Use This Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"or more? The most common meanings are:

1. To ask what is required to buy this atm card
2. The question is to indicate whether one can use this card at this particular atms, or only at that one.
3. There is no answer to the question and the speaker is trying to find out about the use of this specific credit card. In this case, this is not a question, but more of a statement of opinion, which you can interpret. 
In all three cases, at the time the statement was made, the answer would have included one of these: (1) ""You can buy anything with an atc card"" (not true). (2) you cannot use at least one atf card (again not true) (3) You can only use an specific card type."
635,Are There Certain Atms That I Can Use This Card At?,Considering this utterance: Are There Certain Atms That I Can Use This Card At? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The phrase, ""Are There Any Atoms Which I can Use this card at?"" seems to be describing a general idea of what was just stated. I'm guessing here, but a more likely intent would be ""There are atoms which I am able to use this at?,"" meaning at the current moment, in the given scenario. For instance:
""I just saw you pull out that card. Are there any atoms you can use at which will get you the job?"" or: ""I see we'll need to work overtime."" 
As a side thought, a sentence that is more common in real-life but more poetic is: are there atoms of which you are in search?"
636,Someone Has Taken My Money And I Don'T Know Who,Considering this utterance: Someone Has Taken My Money And I Don'T Know Who What is the intent that best describes it?,"?"" You have to answer the question in one word. If you need to add a word or a clause to describe it, be sure to include that in your answer as well.

  1. **(D)**

**Context:** This is something you have done. Your friend knows you stole from the office and she wants to know more about what happened. It's a question you can answer with your own two hands. So answer question two to get credit for (D). Choice (A) can be eliminated because a person who is caught stealing is unlikely to admit to it. Choice **_(D),_** however, is your best fit. In this context, ""stolen"" means ""taken.""

 **Explanation: **If a friend of yours is aware of a theft, then you know it is likely that you were also a party to the thievery. You've been caught, so your friend has a reason to be interested in what you did, and you answer ""yes"" with a simple ""Yes."" If she doesn't know how much was taken, though, she'd be curious as to precisely how big a chunk was missing. Therefore, the correct answer is **_D,_'someone has taken my money.' _** It sounds like something that's happened, but she knows it was you, not someone in the neighborhood, who took it**_.

637,I Was Charged On My Account That Shouldn'T Be There.,Considering this utterance: I Was Charged On My Account That Shouldn'T Be There. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:

638,There'S A Direct Debit I Wish To Dispute,Considering this utterance: There'S A Direct Debit I Wish To Dispute What is the intent that best describes it?,", with no other qualifiers?
""I would like that to be done.""

Does this phrase express the idea of a future event or a past event? What about future events of this kind? ""I wish to dispense a direct debit."" ""We wish that you would dispend a Direct-Debit."" 
I know what a debit is so I know the difference between a present event and an event in the future. But for what I would call a one to two word phrase, I'm struggling to find a correct answer.
Thank you.   :-)
p.s.: I don't know any other way of expressing this. I've just written it from scratch. If you know a better way to express this idea that is shorter, clearer, concise, please let me know. Thanks!  :P
EDIT:
The word I wanted to use was not a verb. It was an adjective. The word is:  ""direct"".  And what would be a good equivalent to that for a short phrase like this, one word?  I want it to convey that the person I am talking to is doing the action. Like: you're direct-debiting me right now. :)  Is ""right""? The correct verb or adjective word to say: ""You're Direct Debiting Me Now!"".  Right? Thanks again for your help!
P.S.: Here is how it looks to the reader if you have a problem with it. ""Direct Debi"" means ""Deb"" in French. (I'm trying to avoid any ambiguity).  But I didn't want to write something like : Direct_Deb. That would sound like I was using a word, not making a sentence. Thank you again! Pardon my grammar. English is not my first language. : (
  Direct__Deb =  De__bi  (Deb)
OR if the word you want is ""debite"", it would look like De_Bi. Again thank you for the help and if any of you speak French, you will see what it's supposed to mean. :-)  It's an error on my part, sorry again. Not trying again to get this question closed. This would have been closed if my question was poorly written. My question has nothing do with the meaning of that one line of french"

642,How Do I Retrieve My Passcode?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Retrieve My Passcode? What is the intent that best describes it?,"with no further context? Is it about password retrieval or changing? 
The context provided is minimal, yet it is still clear that he's asking about something relating to passwords. However, I can't think of a single word to answer this question and Google isn't helping either with it's suggestions.   Is there one?

A:
If you Google for your own name, Google shows you what the top results on Google search results are for you.
So, how many times a week do you have to do this? Probably about 1 million times right? If you google your name every day, in a day you would have 1,000,00 results for 'your name'. Google is very good at telling you the answer, when you are looking for it. And that's what google will do for others, too. (It can be used a lot with google image searches, for example.)
But, if it wasn't about your personal information, it wouldn't help others. So, is 'changing' part of your'retrieve' question? Or, do we know that it isn’t? Because if so, then we can answer the question for sure? (Because then, we would already have your information.) But, you don‘t specify the context of this phrase in your question.

644,I Lost My Password,Considering this utterance: I Lost My Password What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The above was a question posed by one of the participants in a discussion we’ve been having about the use of phrase structure rules in English and the role that such rules play in determining the grammaticality of utterances. We”ll return to that question at the end of this blog post; for now, let me offer an explanation why I chose that particular uttering as the sample for the above question.
It is an example of a construction called a “passive voice utterement.“ In such an utterment I have a noun (I lost my passport) which is followed by a verb (lost – past tense) and an object (my passport). This is a type of construction used by native speakers of English (like me) in everyday speech. The passive voice constructions can make for some very interesting examples (which is why they were given a separate name: they‘re not just ‘passives,„ as they are sometimes referred to in dictionaries).
I‟ve always thought it curious that some of these utterings are perfectly acceptable grammatically. And I‚Äôve also always wondered what the difference is between the ”active voice› and passive voices. After all, I know what ‚être‌ means and know the passive (êtres) can‏t be passive; so why is it that passive can exist? Why is passives so „acceptable‡ in some instances?‹ I thought that would be the topic for this post. It‍Ì´ll be a brief exploration into why the construct is used in the first place in such instances. As my ’12, ‑‱‖, and ‖‰‬ posts in our ‪#‎LanguageLab‧‛ series have shown, sometimes what one calls ‛passivization�‭․ and what is referred in textbooks as ‡‪passivity ‫is not a passive sentence. At best it ì´s an active utterence (and a construct). Let―s look at a couple of examples. (Note that these examples are meant only to illustrate and not to be taken as gramatically correct). In the following two utterences, the pronoun I is in an ‒�"

Yes. But the answer depends on what you mean by ""best"". ""What do you call your mother in English?"" doesn't work in the way ""what is your mama's name?"" works.
So what is a word or phrase is not just something like ""mother"", but something which best fits the context for the question. That might be a lot of things. For example, I could use ""nama"" (meaning mamma, or my mamaca in this case). For my mother's maiden name I might use my last name (in Spanish this would be ""Alfonso"" which is ""Fon"" in French). If I asked ""who is mami"" for my mum I would reply ""la mia mamusica""
But for something that is very very common it might as well be something more or less like English ""password"" or whatever you want to call it. It is used all the time in everyday language. If you are in any doubt, ask a native speaker. They will say the correct word/phrase. I don't know if I'd know which one to say. So, ""something is wrong with my password"" is good enough. :)
I think we all speak in ways that are more idiomatic than we realize. We don;t think what we say is weird or unnatural. (I know I've said some weird stuff when answering some dumb questions on here, lol.) Sometimes we don' think about the difference until it is pointed out by someone else or a good learner, and sometimes they say what I think, too. This is just common practice and natural language and it works out ok. You are all fine :-)
P.S. Your answer is much more specific in that you said it was ""my mother"". It isn't just the mother. The mother is who is being asked. Someone said in a comment about ""My mother said"" being grammatically incorrect, however,"
647,Something Is Wrong With My Passcode,Considering this utterance: Something Is Wrong With My Passcode What is the intent that best describes it?,", using a natural word order?





I. Intuitive

   This is a problem with one of my devices
  It's a device
 It is my device 
It is one  my. device.
 II. Structured
 A. This statement is grammatically correct.  How can it be improved?
 1. We can improve it by adding a verb. For example, ""Something is wrong with my password.""
 2. It can be reworded using the verb ""is."" For instance, we have ""There is something wrong.""
B. The following is also an acceptable way of stating the same intent.

 I. ""something"" ""wrong "" - one "" device - my "" passcode ""  ""my pass code is not "" ""it's not working "" "".  it's my pass  code "".
 B. Another acceptable and shorter way to rephrase is ""The password/pin is incorrect.""

 III. Semantic
 If I ask,'What kind of problem do you have with your device? '
A. I may receive responses like'The battery is low, The display is broken, etc.'
 - These would be acceptable
 I have trouble remembering my pin
 IV. Formal 

 A1. If it is an app with security and authentication mechanism, the correct response would typically be'Your PIN is invalid.' I can't use my PIN, or my account is temporarily locked.' A2.If it was a password manager app, and the user said something like, I cannot enter my master password, then the answer would generally be,  'You did not enter your password' or 'Your account password is expired, you will need to login again.'  V. Informal
 'Something's wrong/broken'
 ""Is it that your passwor'  is out of range?  What's up' ""It's that my' pass-code  not work'"".
 VI. Compound: The phrase is formed by combining a base word with a preposition "" is/was/were"" to create a new word that expresses the base concept as an object or an action. As used in the above examples, prepositions do not modify the meaning of the object they are attached to; rather, they merely act as connectors for forming"
648,"How Do I Reset A Forgotten Passcode, Please?","Considering this utterance: How Do I Reset A Forgotten Passcode, Please? What is the intent that best describes it?","?
To me this phrase suggests to have in mind a solution or an action to be performed by the person making the utterances in a context of a specific issue. 

A:
[I want to] Reset a forgotten passcode
Reset a password
How do I reset a lost or forgotten password?"
649,I Can'T Recall My Passcode And Need To Reset It.,Considering this utterance: I Can'T Recall My Passcode And Need To Reset It. What is the intent that best describes it?,", in the positive. The first choice is to say (positive) that I can't recall my passcode. This means I've forgotten it and need to change it. It's not very descriptive, but this is what is happening. Another choice would be (negative) I need a new pass code. There is no need for this. We all know it already.

How do you think that sentence should be understood? (This is important because it determines how you need the punctuation to be.)
A good question to use for your final score. You need this for a good score in an exam. (Your exam has a lot of emphasis on punctuational grammar. Grammar and punctual grammar are very interweaved.) 
Your grammar is sound. Just a couple of tips:
You use the apostrophe incorrectly. 'I need that' instead of 'My need is'
When it comes to punctal grammar, the correct usage is:'I cannot recall (that)' instead 'i cannot't recollect'"
650,Can I Be Given A New Passcode?,Considering this utterance: Can I Be Given A New Passcode? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

Can I be given a new passcode.
or 
I would like a more secure pass code.   (A more difficult or complex word to guess)
The intent expressed is clear. But I'm not sure whether it's a ""sentiment detection"" or ""keyphrase extraction"". For which model should I use? Is there any other model to use for this problem? Thanks in advance!!
Update:
If I can't get it from the original utterances, what is a good source for extracting this kind of intent?  I mean I know it should be a question or a sentence, but is there a source which contains this sentences? I don't know a dictionary to do this, because there is so many words in English. I tried to collect a sample, like: (The sample is just random words), so I could extract the phrase by some algorithms. And I just need one phrase and the corresponding label. It's not a multi-classification task, I only need to extract one sentence of this type. So, if you have the source, it will be great. Thanks!!  Here's part of the sample I collect:  ""Do you know if your phone's pass codes can be changed by the owner?""(I think this sentence is from ""Can i be Given a New passCode?""), 'Do your passcodes' is my label
""The pass-code on my phone has been stolen, can I change it?"" (I know this is not about ""I"" in the example. it is about the phone) ,'phone's'
A phone is usually the device of communication, so can it be used to express this ""intention""?  If can, is it a common phrase? Can it used in other sentences to make it clear like 'phone stolen' (or a phone that has stolen)?

651,I Do Not Know My Passcode.,Considering this utterance: I Do Not Know My Passcode. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I don't feel there's a one word answer here but I would say that it sounds as if you are asking your friend if he knows your phone number.
If I were to ask a similar question, I'd ask what they are thinking of doing. If you were asking me what I'm doing I might respond with I am not sure because I haven't told you that, or I don’t know. 
For example, if I asked someone what my mother is doing today I could respond ""I'm not too sure but maybe getting something ready for when you get back"". This would be interpreted as meaning that you don;t quite know what she is planning but you hope that she will share it with you when she has made up her mind. Of course, this might not be your interpretation. It might mean ""What are you doing?""
Another common phrasing would come from your mother ""Oh, what are we doing for dinner today?"". This means she would have no plans in mind but if she does have them on her she can give you more detail. For instance ""If we're cooking then I know we need to make some extra."" would mean that they have a vague plan in their mind that will not go beyond that."
652,I Don'T Remember My Code To Get Into The App.,Considering this utterance: I Don'T Remember My Code To Get Into The App. What is the intent that best describes it?,", a sentence, or a complete thought? This is a difficult task if there is more than one possible choice.

Here are three choices (I think):
I have no idea where my code is, but it would be nice for me to get into my account, would you mind doing the deed for ME? = I have lost my access code and I am seeking for someone to help me get in (with the help of some software).
What is your code to enter your account?
Do you know your own code, I don't recall my own. = What do YOU (as a user) think about it when you read it, in your opinion, what is its meaning? Do you like it? What would YOU change? Is it suitable? etc. etc...
This one: Do I know my password?= Is my answer: Is this statement true or false?: I DON' TKNOW THE PASSWORDS (or PASSWORD) I MADE! = Is the statement (false or maybe true? If there are some doubts or uncertainties with regard about the answer, is it ok? or what do you think? (maybe a question to ask is ""Is my statement TRUE OR FALSE?"")
It is very common that the user asks himself ""what would I do if that was my case""? and the question is: ""What SHOULD I DO?""
Let us see, for example: The user is locked out of his account: = the action should be:
1. Find a new password, and write/change his/her password
2. Recover the password by resetting the account or by changing the code for the recovery process
3. Reset the administrator or reset the machine
4. Report to the support, which is probably the best solution in the case of a serious error, that has left the computer without access and has no recovery. But this is rarely a very good idea for a non-serious problem (see #1 and #2.)
5. Contact the service, to see if he is able to recover the lost account
The problem is that it is hard to find someone who really knows the answers to all the questions we might ask to him and it also would need the time and money of the client to give him all (and all again) the options he might have"
653,I No Longer Have My Passcode.,Considering this utterance: I No Longer Have My Passcode. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

In other words:
Is this about: ""the ability to change one thing in place of something""
Or: Is this a statement about having no more of a password? Or, is it a ""I will no longer have a secret code that I have to remember...""? 
If I were to say:  I no,longer have my password, and someone responded  ""why did you stop having your password"" I would have no idea what he or she was thinking because I do not have enough context to understand the meaning.   The same applies in this case. What word choices might work here? Is my intent to be able to easily change a thing to something else? or is my real intention ""to no long have something that was once secret""  Is there a third possibility? How is this phrase meant to sound? ( I tried googling for phrases that would indicate something like this but didn't come across anything)

654,Why Won'T My Passcode Work?,Considering this utterance: Why Won'T My Passcode Work? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? 

For example, I can see that someone asking ""Why won't my code work"" has the purpose of ""solving"" a problem or a difficulty with a program. If someone asks ""What is this code doing?"" it usually means that the speaker has no idea what is going on inside the code, so it is asking how the person expects to solve a ""problem"" with the program without knowing the details of how it works."
655,Can I Resent My Passcode?,Considering this utterance: Can I Resent My Passcode? What is the intent that best describes it?,"in your language or in another?

If the answer includes “I don’t think so” or if it includes the phrase ‘I resent my passcode because“ or ” I resent the pass code,‘
we have to be careful, in the light of recent events, not to misinterpret it.
You might be thinking that we‚Äôve misinterpreted it as meaning. Can you resent your password? Or you‡'re resenting your pass-code or the fact that you have a pass? We don't mean either of these interpretations. So if you're thinking either one of those, then you need to read the article that follows the one you are reading. We're not saying that, but this is a matter of context. The best way to understand it is to look at another sentence and ask ""In context, would I interpret this sentence as what it seems to say?"" and we have chosen to do that for you. This is what we came up with. ""Can you be resentful of your code (pass-phrase) if that code is your only way of accessing your data?""
This sentence, ""I can be (can you) resent (resent) (to resent) [verb] (a) past experience?"" has to have the past tense. That's because it states a completed past event. You were resent. It's the same as ""The dog was resent"" or ""She has been resent"". We have used the verbs because we wanted a complete sentence that has an active verb. A passive verb does not have an appropriate tense: ""To be [transitive object] is resent""? The dog is being resent, or he has being been, she has having been and she is having to resent her past. And so, we've gone ahead and used our verbs instead. These verbs, to the point in time that they take place. Not the event (like 'be happy') that happened at an earlier point. But the present (or past or future) of that verb is expressed using the appropriate time. For example, if the verb was be angry, the tense is ""is"" in ""He is angry"". But if we want to describe a past act (the dog barking), the word, and therefore, is: was. Thus: 'He was"
656,I Need To Reset My Passcode. How Do I Do It?,Considering this utterance: I Need To Reset My Passcode. How Do I Do It? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

How do I know? I just made up that example. I’m going to look at several examples of I Have To‘s and I Can‚Äôt Wait To Have” as one word (IWTW) or as two (ITW). And we„Õll see what the most frequently used phrase is.
Here are a few examples:
I have to go to the store, and it“Å£ not going happen right now. (It sounds like “I can't wait to have that happen‟)
You need to get that done now—I'll help you with the details.‛
‗ I need an answer now, so let me know what you‡Ë¡ think. ” ‘
He/she can‹Ñt stand it. He/her can stand. She/he can'nt stand that you're making them/him wait. You can t stand to wait that long. And so on. See? ‗
So let‰ÔĹs see how these all fit in the pattern. They are all I WTW or ITW. Let›Æ™s take I want to...
It‵Ös not the right time. It's not even too early to call. We don‒Òt have time to waste. ""We can"" wait for you to leave. The time is not right. Now is too soon. If you want my help, you need my attention now.""
Now if you see that they all start to sound alike, don't despair. This is because they share the same underlying theme: time, or more specifically, time as in, a limited amount of time before something is no longer acceptable. 
And, if we compare these with, let's say, I have a lot of work to do tomorrow, we can see the common thread. Again, this is a limit on the length of an acceptable period of the present time—a lot. But, the IW/I(tW) pattern is so powerful, that we use it for far more than just times. For example,
A lot depends on it (the situation), and we need it now ("
657,Show Me Please How To Reset My Passcode.,Considering this utterance: Show Me Please How To Reset My Passcode. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The correct response is:  I have lost the password for my Apple iPad and need to get it back.
Why is that the answer? 
It appears that it's not the same as the phrase:
Show me please how to reset my password...   (what would you say that you need, in order to do?)  The phrase as used to the Apple website appears to be: ""I need help with my iPad.""
I was reading the question of another poster and thought that he was asking how do I reset the lock on my screen, not resetting my passcode.  My thought was that if he meant that, I would say the appropriate response as that: How do you change your screen lock? (or better yet,  Let me show you how...)  What I think he actually meant was I've lost my Pass code for the screen locking. I do not know how the two differ. It's my guess that maybe there is not an English translation into a single word that represents the meaning? That's when I decided to come to this website to see if there was a way to make my own single-word response that is appropriate to convey the message. (Or at least I thought this was appropriate at the time!)
My question is, is there a difference in the wording? I could be just being silly, as I'm not a native English speaker. My thoughts are that this should probably be two distinct answers, but I am not sure. Please let me know. Thanks.

658,Help Me Reset The Passcode.,Considering this utterance: Help Me Reset The Passcode. What is the intent that best describes it?,"? This is a difficult question to tackle, but I have a hunch that “help” is not the primary intent, which I infer is to be able to enter a PIN to reset a forgotten pass code, to unlock a phone for which one no longer has knowledge of the passcode. Is my inference correct?

To better grasp my intuition, I looked at the top search results, in Google and Bing for ‘help me set a pass…’. They are, of course, the exact same two websites, with the same exact phrases, that are both identical in their ranking. But, their rankings differ, and they do differ in the way in which they rank the page results for these exact search terms (see the graph below).

660,What Should I Do If The Passcode Doesn'T Work For Me?,Considering this utterance: What Should I Do If The Passcode Doesn'T Work For Me? What is the intent that best describes it?,". I.e. does it express an opinion, or a statement of fact. (It also includes this question: Where will the answer be published? For this assignment the question will be: published on a website for public viewing.)

What should you do if the code doesn’t work for you?
This question is similar to the last one. In this case the speaker is asking what he/she should do when the number/code (the password) doesn't work. The only difference is that he isn't specifying where it will have to be posted.
In addition to expressing an action, it could be a request to someone to do something in the future
“What do you mean by that?”
An example of this:
Bob: ""Did you hear that they found the man?""
Jane: “Yes, I did.""
If Jane didn't, Bob would ask a question about what she'd heard. But in this context, the use of the present tense (has/have) is being used to express a current action. It's the same as:  
""Did your dog eat my cat?""  ""I didn‘t see my dog this morning."" = I am asking if he did/did not, and if your (singular) dog ate my (plural) cat. This is an example because if my ""dog"" did eat your ""cat"", then it's not a real question to ask about, because my question has to match what actually happened. So if I ask you if you saw your dogs eating my cats, then my answer has no meaning. Same logic applies to this. If Jane answered this (what the teacher is referring to here) question as ""Yes"", it wouldn't make sense to respond with the words: ""...did/didn't you know?"""

As you correctly point out, I is used as the object of to in that sentence, and this is a very common pattern of using the I-switch as an object and verb in spoken English.

– ‚We”.
This is what the password was for? (I.e. “I forgot my password, please reset it for me.“)
If the phrase was spoken in a conversation with another person, the speaker has forgotten his/her own password and needs resetting. This one can be very subtle. For example: Someone is having breakfast with a partner (at a public space) and they„Ülst the conversation around to passwords, to what they should use to log into their accounts and the like. The speaker suddenly realizes that he/she‟s forgotten the passwords to the accounts he is using. (If this is indeed the case, it may be because they were not set to remember passwords.)
-‹I‣. A person just forgot the username/password. If this was a question that was asked, someone has a password to an account. Or if there‡Å‰÷ÇÿùÒÔÆÛá a user, one that a friend/co-worker/employee is logged into, then he asks how to get in. Someone just accidentally typed in an incorrect password. And someone was trying too many different characters and didn‛ÐÁ‖Ìít find the right combination. One can try to reset the account to factory settings, or to a default (and hope it is a good one).
Or it could just be a statement that someone didn/t want the rest of the sentence to know. Like, ″›Õí. I just thought I should know, since this would require me to have an active password on the server. It‏ý‪Ñï‥ÓåÏã á¡á´åéÍääØ ÀìÊÞåáåçÚÛÝíüõòÎÍîðËæÖó äëþÙÈ å‱å¹à�"

668,I Forgot The Code To Access The App.,Considering this utterance: I Forgot The Code To Access The App. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

Can anyone enlighten the meaning of the two phrases? Or maybe there are rules for phrasings?   Thanks!
Edit: A quick googling shows that 'faux pas' has to do with the second example, whereas 'forgetting the password' is a euphemism of 'I made a mistake.'

670,Can You Help Me Reset My Password?,Considering this utterance: Can You Help Me Reset My Password? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

This question could be a good place to point out that the question has a grammatical error within it. The word ""reset"" is a transitive verb, meaning that it takes a direct object. However, in the sentence, ""My password has been reset"" we can see that there is only one object, the ""my"" pronoun. A transmissive verb (a verb which does not require direct objects) does work in this instance, because this verb can be understood either as intransitive or as transgressive.
So, can you help me reset my password? is an ambiguous question, and therefore requires a clear explanation. It sounds more like a request for help than it does a question."

  <phrase>  

Is this a noun phrase that describes a verb or a preposition phrase?

  HowDo I reset the passcode
- The pass code is a password, so it is part of the verb phrase.
However, the sentence as it stands is ungrammatical. If one removes the prepositional phrase (it is), and makes the clause a subject, it becomes grammatical, but not natural, for the following reason. The sentence expresses a single, simple, declarative idea, ""How do you reset your password?"" However, one could also use the structure, It is necessary to know how to reset, which, while it expresses the same idea as the first sentence, suggests a more complex thought, that you are supposed to have a way to figure out how."
673,What Should I Do If I Forgot My Passcode?,Considering this utterance: What Should I Do If I Forgot My Passcode? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?  

I'm having a bit of trouble with a grammar/grammarly/word problem and I hope you can help me. I'm working on a sample sentence and this is what I have so far:
The utterances that would express the given intentions: 

 1. ""I am not sure, therefore, what to do now"".  I think that the intended meaning is, ""The given sentence is ambiguous, so I cannot tell what the intentions are"".
  2. ""[T]his [sentence] may [have a] double purpose"". I can't figure it out what he is trying to express here.  This sentence seems rather awkward and is not an answer.
 3. ""... I do not know why this happened"". This is a valid use of I am but is it grammatically correct?
 4. It seems like there are many other possible ways to say the same thing: ""What do you think you should do?"" ""Why don't you know what you will do?"".
Can someone explain to me what this guy is really saying here? Also, can someone help identify the exact intentions and help make some sort of pattern of how I should be approaching this sort. Of course, you would need to explain the grammar behind the sentence. Thanks for your help. Here is my full sample and explanation to the sentences. Feel free to critique.

 ""In this particular sentence, I believe the word 'that' can be replaced by 'this' and it would still make grammatical sense. This could then be understood as ""This may have two purposes.""
 2: This does not fit gramatically either. If ""this"" should have been the subject, then he should've used ""who"" or ""that someone"" instead. However, in the way it was used, it does seem to be a sentence fragment that is meant to start a new sentence or phrase instead of the previous ""sentences"" that were stated earlier. Therefore, if we replace ""Who"" and ""That"" with ""Someone else"" we get ""Whoever that it happens to, that person will be the one who does something in this situation"".

 3: It depends on the speaker's tone and meaning. For example, we can assume that he doesn't really mean ""if I"" but it is simply to describe"
674,My Passcode Doesn'T Work,Considering this utterance: My Passcode Doesn'T Work What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

In my experience there are 5 types of answers to this question:
1.) An answer that reflects a feeling of helplessness and powerlessness.
A common type is ""I lost the phone and the number"". I think that this is an example of passive voice. The speaker is saying ""The phone has been lost and I don't know what to do about it"". It is as if the speaker were saying: ""My phone is lost"". This type of answer is usually accompanied by some passive verbs like ""It is not working because "" or ""it is broken"".
2.) The second type reflects the fact that the problem has just happened, so there is no certainty that a problem of this type exists. There are many possible solutions, all of which are not certain to help. A common variation is: The number that is programmed on the remote control has expired and my PassCode doesn't work. This is a statement of fact. But it doesn'nt say anything about the root cause of the situation. It doesn’t indicate a lack of certainty, only a desire to move on. In other words the answer does not indicate anything that will help the listener. ""Maybe you could try turning it on and see if it wakes up."" The answer indicates no confidence in the solution you are about to propose. 
3.)  This third type expresses the lack-of-certainty of a solution. You might get an answer such as: No problem. I already have another remote that works. As the person saying the word has no idea if what they are suggesting will work, they need to express some confidence that it can work or at least be useful. If the first answer of type 2 is used, it might be combined with some uncertainty like: Maybe my problem is in my remote and it is going to get fixed. Again the intention is to convey some certainty but not necessarily in a way that would help you understand what may be the most useful solution to the specific problem you face. For example, the response of: I‘ll come to your and have a look might convey a sense of confidence to an outsider that you do not need help, but to you it may not convey any certainty about how they can help at all. Another common example is when you say “It might just be my phone“. That is, you"
675,Tell Me How To Reset The Passcode.,Considering this utterance: Tell Me How To Reset The Passcode. What is the intent that best describes it?,"(if more than 2 words)? How do the speaker and listener perceive it as expressed? How would it be best expressed using an imperative or declarative sentence?

Tell Me - how to reset the passcode - best way to express this is to say:tell me what you do - when you type in the wrong pass code - you press and hold the correct button.
tell Me
- How to Reset the Pass Code
How to - tell
you - to
press - and
hold - the
correct
button. (I.e. you are
asked or reminded what to do.)
The way you
would speak this out loud is:
""Tell me
how to restart the lock screen.""
(The phrase 'what to' is a verb form used with a subject.)"
676,I Am Still Waiting For A Money Transfer To Show,Considering this utterance: I Am Still Waiting For A Money Transfer To Show What is the intent that best describes it?,", or in a complete sentence with an object?

a) I was waiting to get my money.
b)I still am waiting for a transfer. c) My bank is still transferring my account. d) the bank has not yet transfered my funds. e) my friend has been transferred, but her account has yet to show. (she wants me to give her the money from my savings account)
Which of these is grammatically correct and why? How does this vary from the other possible grammatical constructions?"
677,My Transfer Hasn'T Gone Through Yet.,Considering this utterance: My Transfer Hasn'T Gone Through Yet. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

This one: ""When I get home, the transfer is through already, it's ready!""
""It's through"" is a phrasal verb, and it means that ""I will no longer need to wait around for a transfer to be approved."" It is not a common verb in the English language, but it is used in other English dialects as well such as American English, Australian English or Australian-born English (in Australia), and the expression ""it's all been through with"" means ""everything has been finished; it will now be ready."" In colloquial American dialect, ""through"" can be used to mean ""ready to use.""
So the ""sentence"" above is, in my view, equivalent to saying:
'My transfer hasn't gone through yet.
When it does, I'll be able to start using it.'"
678,I Am Confused As To Why My Transfer Could Still Be Pending.,Considering this utterance: I Am Confused As To Why My Transfer Could Still Be Pending. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I want to know the different ways of phrasing that I could put in the sentence in order to express the best intent.
Is it:
(A) I am confused as to...
   (B) Am I confused....? 
Does the confusion be expressed in (1) or (2):
1. As to why my transfer could still be pending.  // I don't think so,
2. Why my (transfer) could be still pending // It seems to me that it should be ""Why my?""
Are there other ways to formulate this phrase, such as, I feel confused, perplexed, confused and puzzled? Would it be better to rephrase the statement by putting ""still""?
The sentence I want is:  I still feel puzzled that my application has been pending for so long and I have been asking for transfer for a year and it still haven't been done. The transfer I applied for is to the Department of Computer Science. I did apply for it in September 2018 so I should not be confused because I know that the first person who was supposed to do it has left the department. In the meantime, the second person is also supposed the transfer to that department but somehow I think there is something wrong with the system because the application is still being pending since it is been one year ago that they asked for the information that is required for them to transfer the candidate. Is there any problem with (A)?  Could this statement be (D)? I do not know how to phrase it. Any ideas? Is this sentence still good? Any comments and suggestions? Thank you. Please help me clear this confusion that has troubled me for many months. Hope to hear from you soon. Thanks again and have a great day. :)
PS. If it's not a clear statement, could you please re-phrase it? I will be much thankful to you for that. This is a very big help. Thank You. :))
PPS
This is what my professor has suggested: ""The confusion could possibly be due to (a) that you do have transfer application and (b) you are not clear as what that application refers.""
Thanks so much for your time. Your ideas are really helpful. By the way, is there another ways I can clear my confusion"
679,How Long Does It Take For A Money Transfer To Show?,Considering this utterance: How Long Does It Take For A Money Transfer To Show? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? The phrase has two clauses and is made up of a verb (to show) followed by two adverbs (how long and for). It is possible for a sentence to express one idea only using a main clause, with other ideas expressed through adverbials. The sentence as it stands could be rewritten in this way:

[Main clause only] How long does it take for [verb only, not followed or followed] a money transfer [to arrive in recipient's bank/account].
Adverbial Clauses
In this case the sentence contains two parts (a main verb and an adverbal clause). An ad-verb is a word that can add information to the verb.
For instance: She gave them a gift. In this example, the use of the adverbal clause to tell us that they got a ""gift"" and who gave that gift is not implied from the word ""give"". This word is an Adverb and it means to ""injure"" or ""hurt"" someone or something. If I wanted to change 'a gift' to indicate that she didn't just give away money it could become: 'She didn t give them any money'.
You might notice that in the examples I have used the subject in both the main and ad verbal clauses is ""they"". The 'they' in an English sentence is usually the noun. It can be an actor or thing, a group or people. For example: It s raining. He's not here. They're gone. There's no one there. This is sometimes a very useful thing to be able to do. We can use a noun as the Subject of our speech or writing, and we can put some advertials after the pronoun and the result is often an interesting sentence. A lot of times it's a grammatical mistake though. So don t say: ""It rained"". Instead, say ""The rain fell."", or in a newspaper style sentence, ""Heavy rain in Sydney caused flooding."" In the first case, 'rain' is being used as an Noun, but as we are telling which rain it is we have put it in ""the"". In second case we've put 'flooding' as 'heavy rain' causes flooding' or as they say it 'The main effect of heavy rain is flooding.'

680,Can You Remove My Account Please?,Considering this utterance: Can You Remove My Account Please? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? I believe I want to express the idea that I have lost interest in an account and want it removed. This sentence conveys this meaning without using too many words (it could possibly be a short version to a longer sentence). The phrase I used may not be the most appropriate choice, but the meaning is understood nonetheless."
681,"I Want To Close An Account But Im Not Sure About Setting Up A New One In The Future, What Do You Recommend","Considering this utterance: I Want To Close An Account But Im Not Sure About Setting Up A New One In The Future, What Do You Recommend What is the intent that best describes it?","?

I would argue that the first phrase is not grammatically acceptable and that one should not think of it as being an independent sentence (and in fact, it does not parse into a syntactically complete phrase). The second sentence should be considered grammatical and the independent word order is clear to the reader.
In general, we need to be careful and not confuse grammar with word-order. Word order can be used to create and/or clarify syntactic structure. In a question about the grammatrical form of some phrase one must first decide if the phrase can even be parsed as grammatically valid (or valid at all, but that is another question)."
682,My Account Needs To Be Deleted.,Considering this utterance: My Account Needs To Be Deleted. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The first step to learning this is to understand the word needs, which means ""to want or desire"", and the phrase, to delete, a colloquial usage in which needs to refer to what we want.
Now, delete as you would do on a word processing application, is a verb that means:
""To remove a document, page, element of a website, etc., from the electronic record of the computer; erase.""
And, what is electronic, means that we can do that with a computer, and so, the correct, but not so common, phrase is: to erase a record, or document: electronic is in the past as if the document was printed on paper: we have paper records or paperless electronic."
683,I Would Like To Delete My Account Please.,Considering this utterance: I Would Like To Delete My Account Please. What is the intent that best describes it?,".

This is a pretty simple question for the most part, since I think there are a lot of ways to describe the same thing in different ways, it'd be easy to miss a few. Also there's a good amount of subjectivity to it, so there will always be opinions that may be valid, but others may disagree. I believe it is an expression of frustration, and I would use the word ""angry"" to best describe that emotion. A better example would be ""I'm angry at you for not calling me back"" or ""What you did made me very sad"".
My personal opinion is that when you're frustrated with something, then there is no emotion other than annoyance, which makes ""frustrated with someone"" synonymous in my head with wanting to say ""sad at someone"". But of course, I could be wrong. The point I'm trying to make in the first place is: it's the anger and frustration that make the sentence, not the desire to delete your account please
EDIT: This seems to be the best description. ""A desire for something to become the case. In this case, the speaker wants to have his/her account deleted.""
Thanks for all the answers! I appreciate it. ^^
Edit 2: Thank you everyone for their answers, really! :3
I think the one that I was looking for was just ""a desire"". And I'll choose @Bryon. He made the clearest explanation. It's an idea that seems like the easiest answer, that's also very useful. Thanks for that!
To me it seems as if ""Delete your own account"" is similar as ""Go on an adventure together with the person"" so the correct answer may also be to ""delete my own"" which is not possible. :/
Another idea to go even more in-depth and more related to my question, is to think of it as to remove the account that belongs to one of the two people in such a way that the other person no longer receives a notification about such deletion. Which would translate into ""remove myself from a list of people"". Again, if I take into account ""you will receive a notice when I delete the following accounts"", this doesn't seem to apply, because the deletion is actually being made by the site and not by myself, right?"

This is for students that enjoy reading, but don't like reading for information.
Students should be familiar with all five levels. They also should know that there are different words in a language that have different levels of formality in speech. (Formality is also known as politeness or etiquette.)
An easy way for a teacher to use this lesson plan with his or her students is to teach two of the levels at a time, each level in one class period, followed by an independent period working on the other two levels for the next class. For students who have trouble remembering what they read, a reading quiz at the end of each chapter can keep the students engaged and moving on. The students need to have the ability to read and understand words so the student can read the passage and answer the comprehension questions. This lesson will prepare students to work in groups to answer a question such as the one above. Students will also be using an app called iReading that has a series of comprehension games. These can also help with comprehension of reading material as well as with reading speed. When using the i-Reading program, students can use their devices to play games where they can choose a category to find answers to different questions, then they will have to identify the best answer, the correct answer and then rate their understanding. i reading gives the grade level level appropriate games to help develop reading skills. If your students have not read this in class before, we recommend using this app. It gives more information than what is listed above, so students would be able to better answer questions such an the ones listed in this article."
685,I'M Tired Of All The Problems I'Ve Had. I Want To Quit This Account!,Considering this utterance: I'M Tired Of All The Problems I'Ve Had. I Want To Quit This Account! What is the intent that best describes it?,"?:

I am using the term ""sentence"" in the following context:
In a written English course at my university, all the students are required to submit a paper (essay) on a particular topic. The paper is supposed to be 1) written on an ""individual"" level, 2) not longer than 1000 words and 3) in a ""proper style"". This is a requirement of our course. If our students fail to meet these requirements we can deduct marks.
The student who just told me ""I'VE HAD IT!"" was one of the worst students in this class. She wrote her essay on ""TIRED"". She said the phrase ""all the problems"" which were meant to cover all of her problems (like her father's death, her mother's divorce, and her failing grades etc.) was too big a topic to write about and so in her paper she ""chose"" to just say ""tired"". That is, the ""subject"" of his paper was ""THAT I AM TIRED"" or ""WHAT I WANTED TO DO WAS TO TALK ABOUT THE PRO'S AND CON' OF BEING TREMBLING AND SINGED WITH PAIN AND THAT IT WAS THE WORST I HAVE EVER HAPPEEN TO EXPERIENCE"" etc. This was her ""choice"".
So the question is: ""Would you call this a single-word sentence?"" Or is ""Sentence "" better for the situation?
Thank you in advance!
(PS: This student is really smart and good at English, so this is not an excuse by her to say she didn't understand.)
Edit: For those who are interested, I've edited the sentence, because the student really doesn't mean to convey what she's saying. (The context of this sentence: She had written a very bad and confusing paper. So I told her it was really bad. But the problem here is that it doesn’t convey the fact that she had actually written an essay. When I pointed this out she said she wanted to edit the paper.) Thanks for your help!!

This utterances can be used in different settings such as social media, online dating platforms etc.
For instance, consider the following cases:
1) Please delete my twitter account right now!
2) I need to change my Facebook profile
3) This guy asked me to delete his WhatsApp account. I was about to comply but my better sense has prevailed. 
Now, how would you approach this kind of sentence for a writing assignment or a conversation (either face-to-face or online)
My approach: ""I will now tell you the meaning of this sentence"" and then I will tell the best approach to this and how to use this for writing/conversation/interview. Then I would also provide examples to substantiate this. But, of course, I can't provide any of these as I don't know the contexts or any details. Any help will be appreciated to guide me towards the right direction. Thanks! :)
PS: I am not trying to provide grammar rules as it is not my area of expertise. Please feel free to point out the flaws in the above approach for better learning. And yes, this is an assignment where I have to write an essay, hence, the reason I posted it on this platform (I hope).
Update:  I've used the example sentences provided by @Mitch D in his comment for my explanation
I have used ""Please delete [my account] right [now]"" to describe cases (1), (2), & (3). However, some of @sherlockm's answers and comments are very pertinent. @Rohin_Reddy's answer also provides another way to interpret this, which can also be considered valid. So, let me explain the context and the approach I used for each one of the three cases. In each case, you will notice, that I provide a paraphrase and an elaboration for the paraphrased sentence. These elaborations are meant to add further details and explanation for how a writer or communicator can approach these scenarios effectively through the use of language (grammar/vocabulary). This is my attempt to explain this in a simple, yet detailed way. This has been my approach. Of-course, there can always be a better answer for an expert in this topic.

687,I Want To Close My Account,Considering this utterance: I Want To Close My Account What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A. I want to close my account
B. Close my  accountC. End my AccountD. Terminate my accoutrement
If you had to guess at this point, what response are you likely to get? If you guessed the first, you are not alone.
I want… close… account. There is an implied ‘not’ in front of the word “account.” We can make this a little more explicit using the adverb ” ’doubtedly‘:
Not „I have an account at the bank. It‟s time to Close the Account“
„ I have to ′clos my ‹account› at ‚the ‰bank‰. ‮It‹ ‱time to ´close the  ‬account´.

 ›   it time. You can close the account with a single word:  It′ ※time."
688,"Unhappy With You, How To Delete Account","Considering this utterance: Unhappy With You, How To Delete Account What is the intent that best describes it?","? Does it mean? The uttering of the word “you” is often an expression of contempt.

The utterances, ""I'm tired of you"" (I’m tired) and ""get out of my life"" are also expressions of rejection. The person who utters the last expression would be happier if the other party took the hint and left. If the person uses these expressions on a regular basis, then you must be aware of it. This person would feel happy if you did not show up at their doorstep for any reason. They may be the reason of your unhappiness. Do you find yourself utter these phrases on occasions? This would not be so good if it is regular. When you use these things, you need to examine your feelings. Ask yourself, why I feel as I do to you? Is it your fault or mine? Do I have to accept these comments? Would it be wise to let these people into my heart and life? If you want to be with this person, and to enjoy their company, is it really so bad of him or her to have that opinion of yours? Are you prepared to put yourself in his or in her shoes?
In a situation, if these two people have been married for years, they probably have similar feelings about one another. There will be no change of opinion in the near future. One can expect a change only when the two of them separate into different rooms, which is not likely to happen. So, when one person says ‘unhappy with you‘ to another, it may mean that he or she is feeling rejected by the object of their love. He might be angry about the fact that you do not want him any more. A person whose ego is being bruised will not allow anybody to take that from them. You need more time and understanding on your part to make him happy. In fact, there are very few things that do make two unhappy people happy together. Some of us will always feel the need for attention from somebody, some of our partners are never satisfied. We may feel jealous that our partner shows special attention to someone else. It is a very normal thing and you should expect such reactions. However, in order to find out the answer to the question - How to remove a profile from Facebook? - there is no other way. All you can"
689,I Would Like To Delete My Account.,Considering this utterance: I Would Like To Delete My Account. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

My intuition is to think that the phrase means the same meaning of ""I Wish To Erase My Self"" but I'm pretty sure it's wrong.
Is it ""Wish to erase""? or it can be a little bit different? I don't know. Is ""Like To"" more appropriate than ""Would like""?
Thanks in advance!
Edit:
I thought about it a bit more and I understand that it could be ""The act as an uttering, that is, as saying"", so ""Delete"" could mean ""Erase"" (with the ""My"" included).
But why does the sentence begin with ""If this action is performed..."" (or with any similar phrasing)? I can understand it if it meant ""This action as if I performed that"" and then came a new phrase. But why is it included with the first question in case of I deleted my account? (in the last sentence of the passage)
Here's the full passage: 
""If that action were performed, my identity would no longer be associated with this account; it would exist independently of my use of it, and my relationship to it. It would be as it was when I created it – a unique instance of myself, existing on my own, independent of any interaction with others.""  .

The full quote: If that were to be the case, you would have a lot more freedom to control who you are on different networks, which could create some pretty interesting opportunities for your digital self.  For example, if Facebook’s algorithm could no doubt determine that my content has a high likelihood of generating leads for my product, I would certainly be interested to see how I might be able to connect my Facebook account, or accounts, to my email list. Perhaps a Facebook login would trigger me to fill out a form with a lead that could then be sent over to the company‘s email marketing list.""

Just a reminder here: in case you need a hint:
I = the subject pronoun in the possessive form of ""I""

698,Delete This Account!,Considering this utterance: Delete This Account! What is the intent that best describes it?,"? I know you can't say it, I've tried. It doesn't really make sense. But you're aware of the meaning of its context and the possible emotional effects of saying these words.

The same thing can be said in many cases for utterances such as: Don't touch that! It's hot!. Here, what you are describing is ""intent"" or ""emotional effect"". The same can also be done in regards to: Let me see that!.
In this particular case: ""Let me"" is just an adverb, and can only modify a verb. In this case, we don't even have a verbal predicate; just the pronoun, which is a noun-phrase. A verb-noun-adjective-verb is not a possible sentence. The adverbs don’t have any grammatical function, hence it cannot be considered as an adjective to modify, since the adjective can‘t be used in this manner. 
However, ""Don't"" and ""let"" are both non-finite verbs, the former being an imperative and latter being in the infinitive mood. As such, it is very easy to imagine a sentence that can express ""Delete This"" as the ad verb, because there are a lot of such combinations with the ""delete"" verb that would be quite similar to “Don”t Delete“, like ”Delete All Of This‡„ and ″Delete A Lot Of It,‖‛. Therefore, they can take an „‹infin. verb›‟ and convert it to an ""adverb"". However, this does not apply to ""That Is"" nor ‛That‚. That is because they are in their respective gerundive state. Also, as you may have guessed, ‚※That is‬  can not take the †inf.‽ verb ""‌to be"" (or any verb for that matter), because it requires an object and cannot take a non verbal subject in its place. If there was, then this would mean that ›that is, is is no longer an idiom. Hence, there can never be a situation where ‹Thatis, etc‰ can actually be the object of an inf. ‰Verb″

700,"This Company Isn'T Good, I Would Like To Delete My Account.","Considering this utterance: This Company Isn'T Good, I Would Like To Delete My Account. What is the intent that best describes it?",".

A. Intended to express a desire to remove oneself from a place, condition or situation. (example: the boy is going to be removed from school.)
B. Expressing a feeling that something is wrong or unwanted.  (for example, the customer felt that his purchase was wrong.) ( example: The girl is leaving this company.) 
C. The statement of an opinion that a person or thing is good, bad, right or wrong. An argument of this type would be: ""The company is not good. Why are you still here?"" Example: a parent might say to his child, ""You are going away from home."" It means ""Go away.""
D. A request for removal as in ""Please remove yourself from my sight.""  Example ""Get out of here."". This may carry the implication of a threat. Example, after a fight, if someone says, “Please leave."" They are saying it in a polite way but the implied threat is a request that they must leave and not to come back again. ""Leave"" in this sense can be used as any word that means to depart or go away. It could be a physical departure, as when someone walks out the door, or it could mean to withdraw from some situation or activity. In such a case, a ""leave"" is always a departure. There are times when an action that might be taken as the word ""to leave"" can carry a different meaning, though. For instance, when it's used in the context of the stock market, it means the selling of shares in order to avoid a loss. When it is used to describe a change in employment, that is, to leave your job, then it carries a meaning of separation, not only from your position. But it can also be the act of separating something (a piece of material).   Examples:
a. She left her job to have a career, taking off with just the clothes she had on her back. - She had a job as an entertainer. but she decided she didn'’t need the money. and the job was a dead end. so she took off. Her career had not started yet. it just began. she was leaving to go some place new. new work. a new career..

701,Can You Delete My Account Please?,Considering this utterance: Can You Delete My Account Please? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? It is either:
Delete Account
Or: Delete Account, Delete me please

My assumption would be delete-me. 
Is it grammatically correct?
I've also heard it used as delete my account
What do you think?   Do you hear this often? And if so, why would they say it? Is it a typo? I thought they were supposed to be careful not to use a possessive or have an apostrophe. It would seem that a proper noun, especially one as popular as Facebook, would have more of a chance of making it into the common parlance.
For the sake of this question, ""account"" includes user, wall and privacy settings of the user. (The ""I"", in my original question could be considered the account. I just thought of using that as the example. )
It might also be relevant to mention that I am in America and I use English as it is spoken and written. However my question would not be appropriate for a British audience and so I hope my explanation is accurate. Any clarification for that would also help. Thank you. :)
EDIT: To further clarify. My assumption is that they are trying to convey their wish to have their user deleted from Facebook (their account). I'm not sure that this is actually how they phrase it. They may simply mean their account, their wall, profile or other things. Or, it may be something more along the lines of what they want to do with their Facebook settings, or delete them completely? But the assumption of their intent being to delete their entire account is based off a common usage of delete in this context. So that is all I can go on for now. Please ask any clarifying questions if you feel that you need to. Thanks. The more clarity you can add, the better. This is my first post here. Feel free to edit it if I do not explain myself clearly enough. ;)
Thanks!
PS: I have seen this post: Facebook Delete account, but I was looking for an explanation of why this phrase is commonly used. A few years ago.

This is an example output I hope I have explained this better this time and thanks to @Aryen for his comments
Intent  phrase
Delete  Am not I  (The intent is to remove ""You, am, not  and I"" as the user has requested ""the deletion of ""you"" "")  not want (This sentence is just for testing) ""not want""
Update:  The data I am looking at has only 3 entries in each case, so, I only want a single output
For example, here are the entries: Am I not?, No I'm not, No not am i?,Not want,
So, my output would be: the intention is satisfied (because the sentence has no Am and is complete) and not wanting anything to do with company because the the statement is about the individual and so on.
Any help would me more than welcome!
Regards

Edit: Added output example
A: am not i
B: i'm ok
C: no i don't  - Not Wanting
D: not ok (I'm happy)
My output is : A,B,D
Expected output: A
(B and D because they are similar in their intents and there is no need for further processing and they should all be output as ""A"")

704,Please Terminate My Account.,Considering this utterance: Please Terminate My Account. What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Is it an expression, a command, or a request? If it is an uttering of the first two, what is its function? It is not used to request an action. It may be a statement of intent. But, as we see, it does not appear in a sentence. How would this work? We may say this is a complete sentence, but in some contexts it may not be.

The word “please” is one of many ways we express intent and intention in our language. We can also use such words as ‘must’, ” ’desirable‘,“should„ etc. These words express a different type of ‚ intent to do something or be present.‛
There is another way to express an intent in another type. This is by use of verb + infix † ′. For example, to say I will do it, use the verb „I will‟ as the word of action (‚ will ‹ do ‟).
When we ask to someone, we make a direct question, using the imperative verb ( ‛ ‐ ″), and use ‡ ‪ ‬, which can be used in the affirmative, and other forms. ‍‡‬ (See more information below.)
 
Please   ‏      .-    -•    - ‰ ‎ ․  .•
•   ‭   ‣ ‮ ※ -   ‒ ‥  › ‧ … ‽ -. •
A question is like a directive. The question has the subject and the direct object. In this case, the question would be:  -  ‵ ‱ ‴-
We often use words like the following:
- - ʒ‮ (ʧ) ‑ ‼ ‗ - -‏
In English we usually use an infinitive. (We don′t use many of these, just some of them) We often want to use a noun form to ask a question or make an inquiry. A noun infixed with ‫-s‪ makes a verb. Thus ‿ ‷ –"

Does it count as the same uttering of the message? Or would it be two utterings?

If there is a single intent, does this make it one utterting? If it has multiple uttertings, would two be required to count this as one intent? Are multiple intent utterts still considered to be utterties?"
706,Please Close My Account. I Am Unsatisfied With Your Service.,Considering this utterance: Please Close My Account. I Am Unsatisfied With Your Service. What is the intent that best describes it?,"? I'll assume one word would be easier to read in the list, but I can be wrong.

I think a two word sentence would fit here better. If you wanted to be really strict about it, I think you'd be able to argue that you can use a one-word sentence in this context: 'Please close my account.' This would work just as well. This is just one of the many things that makes the English language so diverse. We have lots of ways to ask for things; we even have ways of expressing 'I want this' with various degrees of formality and politeness. 
If you want to know when this can happen, you should probably read the question you just asked: English Learner: When is it appropriate to use the word Please?
As a native speaker of English, it's perfectly appropriate at all times to say, 'please'. I have been known to make mistakes with 'thank you'. But in these cases, the mistake is because I was not careful with the language, so if you ever use these phrases in a 'correct' way, feel free to mention it to the natives here! You'd get an earful, of course. And an 'envelope of appreciation' to boot."
707,Please Delete My Account.,Considering this utterance: Please Delete My Account. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The most common word, that would indicate a request for your own account to be deleted, is ""please"" -- with other expressions being ""Can you please"" and ""You can do me a favor by."" In the case of this question, a two-word expression is necessary to convey meaning, and thus it is appropriate to use that phrasing.

Delete is not a verb, so I'm not sure that I agree with that. It is possible to delete files, it's a command to a file manager. There are also applications like BleachBit (a graphical file cleaner) and ClamWin (for Windows only, but with a simple command line front-end). You may be right about 'you can', but my own preference is 'please'.
I think it boils down to personal preference of course. The question is a little ambiguous at the moment so the votes are a bit too quick to go into too much detail. If 'delete' isn't technically correct or if'remove' fits it better (as suggested in comments), you can change votes and edit the question so it more accurately fits. In case I don't answer soon, you may post a comment with the new question and I can look into what I think is best. You can also flag any post that doesn't fit the site format, or ask a moderator about it. Sorry I didn't notice you asked this earlier. But I'll definitely edit it to reflect this."

709,I Want My Account Deleted!,Considering this utterance: I Want My Account Deleted! What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
It is clearly an attempt to express the will of the speaker and is most likely an order. 
The verb to delete is intransitive, and requires a subject (a thing or person) in the sentence. I (being your account) is a person, therefore you have to say ""I want my account deleted"", but the person who wants the account to be deleted can be a third party that wants or needs to have it deleted for some reason.
If your question is how would you say it in Spanish, it is correct in both languages. You would be more specific with the verb and the subject, for example: 'Quiero que mi cuenta sea eliminada' or 'Queremos que la cuentas quede elimina'."
710,I Am Extremely Unhappy With This App And Want To Get Rid Of My Account?,Considering this utterance: I Am Extremely Unhappy With This App And Want To Get Rid Of My Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

If you're not familiar with the phrase IAMXEU, it's a new addition to the language, but already there are a number of uses:
(1) ""I am extremely unhappy with this app""
""This person is an absolute nightmare"" ""This thing is awful.""
But it also has many other uses. The dictionary gives an example: ""Are you happy with your life?"" (2) And: (3) I'm not the most happy (4) That's really not my style (But is mine.)
I would guess #3 is a variant on the #4 example.
Note this usage, which I am not sure of, is used in legal documents to indicate the author has read and understood the contract: 'I AM EXTREMELY UNHAPPY WITH THIS ACION AND WANT TO GET RID OF MY ACCOUNT' (or a slightly varied version I believe)."

(Note: The answer does not necessarily have to be a single word or a two word phrase, any one line or paragraph of text can express an intent.)

In this particular question, we are assuming that the question’s intent is clear and the person who asked the ‘can you delete my account” question clearly intends to delete their account.
A good paraphrased phrase might be: ""Can I have you remove my access from your service?“; or even ""May you deactivate my email account?
Or for an entirely different scenario: Can you add my phone to the do not call list or remove the phone from the home?"
713,I Wish To Close My Account. I Do Not Like The Service You Provide.,Considering this utterance: I Wish To Close My Account. I Do Not Like The Service You Provide. What is the intent that best describes it?,"? In my mind this phrase means, I wish to leave the service. In other words I don’t like what the organization (or other service provider) is offering me.

What are your own thoughts regarding this?
1. This phrase expresses the desire that a customer has to discontinue a relationship with a provider. It indicates dissatisfaction and/or a feeling of being trapped. The customer could be expressing a desire to be disconnected (“off”) the provider, or to cease the services being provided. For example:
a. “I wish you would cancel my subscription for service X.  ‘     ‍ —I do not like the way you market your product. Please discontinUE the account that I established.I want to stop doing business with you. Good-bye. Thank you for you service, but I am not satisfied! ‎ ‌‏ ‚„‰․‣›‭′I am going to cancel and discontinUe service ‬‹‮※‽‾
b. As a passive verb: ‘I don't want them to do this. [The client does not want us to make this change. He prefers to keep his current arrangement.] [He wants to terminate our arrangement. We can't be more precise as to what he has in mind.]
c. Or, in the context of another word, ’I would like…‖‪‡ to change… •‧‥ to stop‱‷‴‫‿ ”
d. To me the phrase ‚I Would Like To‛ expresses a strong desire and is synonymous to the verb phrase in English „I Wish. ""
e. If we add the word ‌""leave‒–‗ or even ‐ ""diss‐‵‑″,​ the meaning of the sentence can become stronger and more focused. Thus; I WISH to close my account. = I would LIKE to CLOSE my ACC. (I‟m done working with/for you) ="

A:
dumb
This is a common word that people use when they think you should know what they mean and that it is important to them that you understand why they don't like what you are doing.  
If they have something that they do or that a client of theirs wants, they won't give you the order and instead will have someone else give the orders that are less to their liking. If it's important enough, the person who wants the service will usually send them to you as you seem trustworthy.
What people don’t want is someone coming and getting a free lunch. You are not expected to do the work. They are expecting you to ask a question, which you won”t ask and then you will tell them something and they expect you not to make another request. When they see people who seem to be more motivated than what is asked of them, their attitude is, Why do we have to pay for this? You need to know that this attitude does not always mean that these people will not do anything for you."
716,"Please Delete My Account, This Company Is Not Working For Me!","Considering this utterance: Please Delete My Account, This Company Is Not Working For Me! What is the intent that best describes it?",", followed by the subject?

717,I Want To Delete My Account. I'M Unhappy With The Service You'Re Providing.,Considering this utterance: I Want To Delete My Account. I'M Unhappy With The Service You'Re Providing. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

You could say that it's an expression with negative connotations. It's a call or statement of intent to stop doing something for a while.
If you were to read the title of this post, you might say it was an assertion that the OP wanted to delete his or her Google account. You are mistaken, however; the statement does not express a desire to do so (though it might express an intent in that direction).
The question is whether there's any negative intent expressed in the assertion. If we look at the sentence fragment itself, it is negative, but it expresses a positive intent. The positive intention is a statement by the user that they wanted the service to be better; if that's the case, then the fragment would be expressing a negative intention. (We'll come back to this shortly.)
When we parse a sentence in language, we're looking at how the words are put together to express the meaning of the thought. Here, the negative verb phrase (I want to) is acting as the subject to the main verb (delete) and the positive verb phrases (unhappy) are acting in an adjective or adverbial manner. We have several parts in this sentence:
I (subject)
want to (modal) 
delete (verb) (not transitive verb) or (negative verb to make something non-existent) = I want not to exist. But this is not correct, so we add the (adjective/adverb phrase) -unh.   = the act of wanting the something to non(-)exist
un(h)appy (noun) -> (1) adjective (to feel or act happy) + (with adverbs) [1] with unhappiness or unhappily. [2] unh(a)ap + y
so far, this part of our sentence has the following meaning: - I'm unhappy. Or: The user is unhappy about having the account deleted. Which doesn't seem very likely. Is the intention of negative? Yes, because it means the opposite of happy. Why is it then not an assertive statement? Well, let's go back and take a look: we said previously that negative verbs can also be negative statements (and that a nonnegative statement is an"

Can you tell Me how to close my account.
Is it one of those things the customer is too busy to do himself and so we have the task of doing it for him? Or is it an instruction the person is asking us to carry out? Is it a request for a favor? The answer is that it all depends on your perspective on the phrase, and on how you look at your customers. It depends how well you know them. Can you read their facial expressions? Their manner of talking? They may be in need of your help, or maybe they just need a little bit of assistance, something to take their mind off their troubles, just for the day. You may feel that in this phrase there‚Äôs some sort of ‚€˜invitation„ÔÇ¨ for you to help them and take the pressure off? Maybe it‪Åìs just some form of a complaint you heard. Maybe the account is not doing as well as it could be, because of some of their bad habits – which they›Ð¬d just as like to talk to you about, but don't, as they know you might just take them on and try to change their ways. Or maybe the problem is one you were thinking about changing yourself, so there is only one person to be blamed. In each case, there are as many reasons to explain this as there there be to describe it. The same is true of the answers to the question that follows „Do you feel you are up to closing this account?“, which is also a statement that invites a question from you ‹ÀªWhat's your point of view? Do tell. Are there more than just your own? You see, we donâít just have our own opinion; we also have yours, even if itâ Ös only in your thoughts. How would you respond to this question"
719,This Company Sucks! Can You Terminate My Account?,Considering this utterance: This Company Sucks! Can You Terminate My Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

1: ""This company sucks?""
2: Can you terminate my account? / ""Can you close my file?"" / Can I close this file? 
3: Terminating / closing my accounts / files, etc.?
The first two choices are quite obvious for me. They have the same meaning. The third choice sounds a bit off. Is there some subtle difference between #3 and #2? Or is it just that #1 is too short to be an acceptable answer in some contexts? In the first place, it is rather common for an individual to say:
""Do you know what time it's? I've lost track of time!""
Is this correct if I want to ask: Do you recognize the time? What if there is no time, as in this example. If there isn't any time at all that is not correct.  Would it be:   ""Do I recognize a time?"" or ""I recognize no [time]""?
What is more confusing is why people say ""this company"", when they mean: That company. It's the one that this one is talking about. So, the speaker wants to convey something like: You have been using the services of this organization, which has been performing a certain function in the market, and now it has turned out that the company has no merit and is just a waste of effort. This company, in turn, does not seem to mean what is expected from the context, unless the person is a professional in dealing with the organization under scrutiny and has the authority, for example, that of terminating one's employment.
I know that these questions aren't too easy to answer. But any help or insight is appreciated and will be rewarded a lot, thanks. I hope you will find my question interesting. Please excuse me again for the rather long question. Thank you. Have a great day or even better: a nice evening. Cheers!

I am not asking about antonym and synonym. I know the differences in meaning.
But please, answer using the phrase form, and not in the form of a dictionary definition, because the question asks for the ""grammatical structure"". I am confused. Please, help!
If you have any additional thoughts, please share. Thank you. 
[NOTE: The question is not about whether ""retrieving"" and ""pulling a thing from someone's hand"" are synonyms, or have similar grammatical structures in one. The issue here is just the opposite, in reverse. ""Removing"" is similar to ""Retrieving"", and I wonder if ""Pulling"" can be used in place of ""Pushing"" in that sentence without a comma.]
The question I asked about removing a card and retrieving money, but, now I would like to ask about what to do when a door is stuck. Is it possible to say the following: ""What I was doing was pushing the door, which I have just now stopped doing, since the force of what I'm doing is no longer applied"". That's what a friend once asked me about. (He asked it in a funny way, so I thought my answer is worth sharing. You'll see it.)

""What is a machine?""
You answer: ""The Machine is The Computer.""
This is correct. The statement was made by a person who knows little about the subject, but you are wrong. A machine is something that takes action or does some work, a robot, for example. You do not need a computer to do that. What you need is an instruction that tells the machine what to perform. When computers were first invented there was no such thing as an ""instruction list"". All instructions came as part of an application program.
If the ""machine"" in the previous statement were a human, and the person had no knowledge of computers but wanted one, they would need to learn how a program operates in order to use a new computer. It is similar for a ""computer"" or a group of people or animals which are to be controlled by programs. If an animal or person is to control a vehicle, there has to first be some kind of interface to let the animal (or person) know what needs to happen for the vehicle to work. Such an interface consists of a set of commands that are understandable to the other and that is what the program must have to operate."

726,Is There A Way I Can Get My Atm Card Back From The Machine?,Considering this utterance: Is There A Way I Can Get My Atm Card Back From The Machine? What is the intent that best describes it?,"in its natural form? To determine the most frequent words and phrases, you can take into consideration the word distribution. This is how you determine what words best describe your phrases. To find the frequencies of the words, the data can be used from the frequency of usage, as well as the total data. In this case, to look for the top three used, we can use both methods. The most used one is by calculating the percentage of times a specific word is used. However, calculating from frequency isn’t always accurate because we cannot use all data in our database. For example, using Google analytics we have a limited sample that doesn‘t allow us to make an accurate calculation of frequency. But still, there is an alternative way to calculate a frequency that is known as ‘word count”. Word count is calculated by looking at the numbers of words to determine how much data we‟re dealing with. If you‚ve ever taken an online class that has you input a lot of text, then you know that this process is not easy because if there„s even one word error, it makes your work useless. That“s why we need an expert! If there was a software program to do all of it for us, that would be an amazing solution. So if you still can remember, let‒s see if the software can do the job.

In the past, I never really paid much attention to how the atm machines worked. I thought it was as simple as using your PIN and swiping the card. Today I had to go to the local atms to deposit $500.00 to a credit card and I wanted to know what was going in behind the scenes. With that said, a little background, when I first got to Florida, one of my good friends from high school, his wife, and her son were in town for a month. They wanted some time away so the three of us spent time together. We walked around the city, took trips to some cool locations, had a great time and even went golfing a few times. It was the kind of time that makes memories. Now, after I got the chance to meet them again, they asked if they could use the account that I used when there and if I would"

If you have to use the verb “eat,” it would mean that the atm is taking a snack right from your card, and that’s it, that wouldn‘t it? This makes it sounds like they took a picture of the card and now they‒re going to send it to your atms, or is there something else in the story? What about you? Is this ‘eat‖ or something more? Please elaborate.

728,The Atm Didn'T Give Me The Card Back!,Considering this utterance: The Atm Didn'T Give Me The Card Back! What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

a. I have the card (in my hand or pocket).
b. You don't have to give me the back of the (card). You have already given it to me.
c. It wasn't you who gave me back the ""back"" of my (credit/debit/bank/ID card)?. No, you just gave it back. The ""you"" is not you. That is why the word ""it"" must be used. ""It wasn""t you..."". So, the use of ""atm"" (not the name) gives a different meaning? That's why I asked you the question, isn't that right? Yes, it is. And that is what I was hoping to get at. If you can't grasp the meaning of (a) then you are going to miss the point of much of what you read. In that case, I don""y think you will be a lot happier reading someone""s explanation, than if you try to grasp it first. But I guess you already figured that out. ;-)

Here is what I came up to in terms of the answer. But, as
 you read, it sounds like a sentence. In that case, the
 first word (A) would be a noun and the sentence would
 sound like this: Can (you return) the (card) to (me)? It is possible to have the word 'out' in a question
 as part of a single word question. If that were the case
 here, 'Can you give me back the card?' would sound
 correct to most people. So, let's say out is part
 of 'can you' and that it was part the question word
 in the example. 'How can you get back out?' sounds
 fine. The last two sentences were not part questions
 and therefore not really acceptable.I am sure there

732,The Atm Machine Stole My Card.,Considering this utterance: The Atm Machine Stole My Card. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

In order to address these questions, we might be tempted to analyze these utterances as being either declarative or interrogative as defined in the context/pragmatics of the sentence. That is, is this a description of how it is in present state (i.e., it’s true today) or is it asking about how something happened in past (e.g., “It happened to me”). However, I‘ll argue that there is no inherent difference in these two categories and that the only way to identify them is to examine how they are produced. If there‟s a difference, that comes from the listener and what is being described. Here are the two ways we can produce the utterences and the implications and assumptions that each has:
1.
I am the owner of my card and I used it for a purchase. I lost the card. [Declaritive]
You can infer that I am upset; I had my money and my credit card but now it has been stolen. You might not know whether I will make a payment or not. What would you do if this were you that had your card stolen? [Interrogative] (“What would I do?„)
2.I have my name on it but no one else is using it. It was stolen in transit from my home to store. (A declarant says) [I had no idea it was in my purse and when I realized there was no money in it, it had already been taken from store to my house] It didn‚Äôt take it; it just went with my other cards into my wallet in your purse. We assume this happens more than we are aware of. There has to be a better way than putting the value of cards and money into the same place and then they can be easily stolen from us!
A interrogator might inquire: How was it stolen [Did somebody take your money or your cards out of your wallet and take the wallet? Or was the money left in a public place for some unknown time period and stolen by a person?]
3.The machine took my [insert card] and stole it out from right underneath my own nose. The machine had a button to press to tell that it could be cancelled. But when the button"
733,The Atm At Metro Bank On High St. Kensington Swallowed My Card. How Do I Get It Back?,Considering this utterance: The Atm At Metro Bank On High St. Kensington Swallowed My Card. How Do I Get It Back? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? I would guess that the speaker is frustrated with his or her card and has a problem with it being ""swallowed."" The problem of the phrase being swallowed is that it is not in the right form. The form is incorrect and the sentence is a bit of a mess because it needs the subject of being in a specific form, it would need the preterite form or the past participle. There are other ways to express the situation of ""having something swallowed."" This example is too wordy and not clear enough to be a good phrase. In fact, the way you can tell that this is bad is you want to add a ""by"" which would not be needed because a by clause only needs a main clause so you do not want it to change the form of what you are saying, just add the ""a"".

How do you improve it?
There are three things that you could do and all of them would improve what is expressed by the utterances. All the three are very simple and would only need your attention and focus to improve the quality of your expressions. First, you would want the to use the simple past tense instead of saying the present tense. Instead of this:
The AtM At My Banc ATM In London Swallows My card.
you could use this instead: 
It ate my card
You would also want something that is concise and that says the exact thing with one word. This is what I did: ""What is your concern?""
I would say that instead you may say: How do I get it back? or, What's your problem?, but I think a better way is: What do i do? The reason is because the word ""your"" is already used. It is implied in every phrase and saying it again is unnecessary. However, when we use ""it"" in reference to a noun, there is no such implied word of who we are referring to and we should always specify it so that we do know to whom we will be referring. To make a distinction between ""my friend"" and ""he"", for example, we need to tell them apart. We say ""his."" We do the same for ""they"" by saying ""their.""
What about the other two? There is something else that I"

A:
Biology is a fascinating subject. So is Physics. But the former is not more fascinating than the latter. The point you made is very well expressed here. ""Physics is interesting too"". It is quite possible that it is more interesting to you than ""Biological sciences are interesting as well"".  
I think that what you really meant to say was: ""I like Biological sciences because they are both interesting and relevant to me."""

What is your answer to that question?
If my mother had an icecream cone..
Why the hell would you say that in a movie..? (and I'm not being disrespectful here)
And lastly, which one of these two expressions best conveys what was intended by the speaker: He ate my card in front of me or I ate his card (without looking for a card) in his presence? 
For the sake of this exercise I'll not look for the answer and would just appreciate a brief explanation on the rationale behind your choice.  Thanks :)
Edit: This question is not for English Language Learners as I am not asking for help with a grammar mistake.. nor am I asking to be corrected as that's not what I've written for. It is a rather simple question of interpretation of a sentence (of two phrases).
To clear some misconceptions:  No, you're not allowed to cheat by looking at the other answers.
I'm a software developer, and I need a simple way to communicate the idea behind one sentence to my coworkers.. This is my personal project.. I have no intention of getting a job and this is just for me.. so I will be the one to decide which phrase is correct and to what degree is it correct.. but I do not expect you to agree to one over the others.. just to explain why you chose one. And yes, it is an English Question and my English is pretty good so do try to give the answers which best explain the meaning.. Thanks for reading.. :)  :D
Also I think the title of the question may have been misleading.. please, if you have an opportunity, please edit it for grammar mistakes or for clarity in the topic.. thanks :) :)!
Cheers..   :)

 EDIT 2!!!  Here is another question to help clarify the difference between: ""He ate the card"" and ""my card was eaten in my presence"". I still have another problem. I asked the questions to a friend of mine and he said the last sentence converes the intended meaning to him. How? If you can explain it, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks! :))

738,What Do I Do If The Atm Ate My Card?,Considering this utterance: What Do I Do If The Atm Ate My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Is the answer:

What do I do if I am hungry and have no food to eat?
Or
what do i do when my car has no gas to run on?I will do anything that is necessary to avoid being hungry or running out of gas.
(The question I asked myself was: If the ATM ate my card what can I expect? I can't just do nothing. I will take action. It may not have a positive effect in this instance, but it could prevent another instance of this same behavior from occurring later. And there may be times when taking action does have an effect with my bank, credit card company, etc. that will make a difference.)
In both cases above, I know that I would have to do something. So is it the action or the inaction that makes a choice? It was my intent to use the verb 'do' and then follow it with a preposition and the noun. My intent in both instances was to give my readers the context of what I should do about it. (I hope)
If the above intent of 'What Do' were to be considered action, then the question could be modified with the sentence construction: what does i/he/she/who... do or should be done about a situation in which....
So how do we know whether it is an action verb or an inaction verb?

If you mean what do you do when the bank doesn't accept your ATM card, you go to a different bank and they accept ATM cards, that's your first action.
You go from a bank that you have your card in hand, which is in your wallet or purse, then take it out.  If it doesn'' t work, and you want to change banks, your second action would be ""Where do i go for another bank""
And the best answer is if you're using a debit card. If its a credit card they can usually reverse the transaction. So what you ask is a really good question."

742,I Can'T Pull My Card Out Of The Atm. Help Me.,Considering this utterance: I Can'T Pull My Card Out Of The Atm. Help Me. What is the intent that best describes it?,"and what is your interpretation of the person’s intent?

If the phrase was uttered to request a withdrawal, the context could be interpreted as the cashier saying ""I can't cash that card.""
A different context would mean it was probably said in a request for a refund.
The person might not have heard a clerk announce that they were out of cash, but it could also mean their card was refused. The clerk could have refused a card for no apparent reason, and the speaker would have had to pull their credit/debit card from another atm, which I can attest to. However, a different interpretation would be possible in the following situation:
a clerk calls the customer over to make a transaction, while there's still an amount on the card. It is possible that this could lead the clerk to ask the question. Another situation is if they are in an unfamiliar at, or they don't have at a bank's atms within the building. I've had that happen to me at an AT/mall before. A few years ago, I went to a gas station that had only one at at the back and there was a lady behind the drive thru, who could only do transaction that required the use of her card and her signature. She couldn't make any other transaction. My understanding was that the at/machine was only for the store, so she was not able to use it, even though she tried. So she had no cash. They were not in line, at least not at that time. In any event, she pulled out her bank card, that she knew would work at all ATMs, from the bank. Then she went inside to withdraw cash from her personal account and returned. At that point I believe they had a machine that accepted credit cards and could dispense cash to the woman. As in this situation, an atlm card will not usually work in such a situation."

744,Why Would An Atm Swallow My Card?,Considering this utterance: Why Would An Atm Swallow My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? How might it be better written or phrased to express the same idea? Can you see the opportunity for a double entendre here?

I was recently asked this question by a friend, and I had to look it up: a “double entendi” is defined as:
“A person or thing that is or may be intended for two or more specific meanings, especially in a humorous or confusing way. An example of a Double entendaire would be when asking a woman she knows if she’s pregnant, the question, ‘Are you pregnant yet?‘ or ’Are your parents really that old? ”http://thesaurus.com/dictionary/Double+entend%C3%AArer
My first answer was that I have no idea, which is why I‚??m here asking you for your opinions. You can answer me, but please be respectful. It‗is a pretty funny story, so I want to share it here. This is from my book: The Life & Adventures of the Legendary Mr. Lucky and Mr Lucky Me, a collection of my writing, including short stories, articles, travelogues, reviews, interviews, essays, etc.
Back in ‚Äú78, I was in Florida, hanging out at an all-night movie theater on Hollywood Boulevard, in the middle of winter. There were only about eight people in line. The usher was an elderly Jewish gentleman of indeterminate nationality. I thought, Hey, he is one of those old people that everyone likes, like in those movies that have the old lady sitting behind a cash register. But he was no old dame. He looked to me like the type that could have easily gone to fight for Hitler in World War 2, or in Korea. And he had just the right amount of gold in his teeth, for the era. As I waited in silence, with the sound of people shuffling, shuffly feet and rustling newspapers, some guy walked up behind the counter and asked him for his change. „Æ?

746,Help!  The Atm Won'T Give Me My Card Back.,Considering this utterance: Help!  The Atm Won'T Give Me My Card Back. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?
In other words: is it a question?  I would like to know how to phrase a sentence, with a single word or a few words, that makes my intent clear, but avoids the possibility of a negative answer.

A:
Cognitive science tells us that we can easily mistake intent for meaning. That is, as people understand the content of your speech, they are interpreting the meaning and not the intended message. 
To help clarify the issue, you should use a verb that communicates the action of giving. Consider saying: Can you please help me? (or give me.)
So using the sentence from the original question:   Help!!. This does not clearly convey the desired meaning so you must change that to ""please help"" or ""can you help"". Either verb can be followed by a pronoun to indicate the person you are directing the request to. The first sentence you gave: I need help! would communicate the same message as I can't help myself!
Finally, to clarify ""help"", use the phrase ""I need your help."" I do need you to help."
747,The Stupid Machine Just Swallowed My Card!! I Need A New One Asap,Considering this utterance: The Stupid Machine Just Swallowed My Card!! I Need A New One Asap What is the intent that best describes it?,"? The phrase itself is short enough to say quickly. And it is a sentence of two independent clauses, so as not to require the reader to read an unnecessary third sentence which says the same thing more slowly and less concisely. I'd say that the primary meaning of the sentence is 'I need a new machine because my old one just swallowed my card'. The word 'asap' also has its own set of primary meanings, some of which make for an interesting discussion. As I understand it, asap means'soon', and it usually refers to time. But it also means something like 'right away', 'immediately', or 'at least as soon as this'. And the phrase'something as fast as possible' is commonly used (in this case meaning 'new machine as quickly as we can get it'), making the overall meaning even more ambiguous than the one sentence itself. Is it the idea of urgency that makes the 'need' part of this sentence a better match for the word as? And why do I need to know what as means to my computer? It just means I know that something is going on.

This post is not about how to write a good short sentence using 'the' and 'a'. That is what this site is about, but this one has enough examples and variations for a post all by itself, if you care to make one. It will be a short one, since I can do a bit of research to find out what I don't know before I write it. There are also a couple of good examples to learn from in the comments section. This post isn't about learning to use the English language more effectively. The intent is to teach you about the way the language works, not the other way around. Let the examples teach what you don’t know instead of teaching you to not care about what they mean. You already have a lot of experience with writing good sentences and paragraphs, and you should be able to figure out how this works by looking at lots of examples. So I won‘t be explaining the grammar in words here. If you know some grammar, it will become very evident. However, I will explain what a few things mean when I use them, in addition to giving you some good words you might want to look up as you read my post."
748,How Do I Retrieve A Trapped Card From A Atm?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Retrieve A Trapped Card From A Atm? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

To use a metaphor, I need to get an idea of what the original intent was; a thought that was going through the person's mind who used the utterances to describe their experience.
This is to give a little background info to a very large topic: what do you think an uttering like that could mean to you? If you say ""I want to retrieve"" is it about something that already exists or is about future something? Do you like the expression ""to retrieve""? Do people use it with a special feeling? How could it make you feel? What could you do with it? And so on. And if not, what would you change in the sentence to make an expression that works better as the one you meant? 
And, yes, in some cases, people will say a sentence but actually not mean anything like it; this happens when people say things like, ""Do you know what I mean?"" and when they use expressions like ""like,"" etc.  In such cases people often mean ""something to me"" and so you can guess that what they meant to say. That's the main reason why it's important to learn how people really mean things and what their experiences are. People's thoughts can be very confusing, even to themselves, and sometimes people are not even conscious of them, or what's going on in their unconscious. So, to be able to know the real meaning of something you hear a person say, you have to think of how and why they would say something like: and then ask yourself, was that really how they said it or did they mean something else, like you just guessed? Or maybe it was meant ironically, etc.. You should use your mind to help you understand the meaning so that you will not be taken by surprise. (and it will save you and make life easier)
The way I see it: when we want something from someone and we ask them what we should do or should we do something, we have two (or even more) possibilities: the first possibility is that we will get nothing in response because it is too personal and they do not know. This can happen to very many people because they are too introverted or they have something they don't want others to find out. If that happens, it can ruin your life. The second possibility of"

This sentence is often used on Twitter by those who have been in a situation where they cannot withdraw money from an ATM. When a user sends you this particular tweet it does not mean that he is actually trapped in the machine. However, it could just be an expression of helplessness. This is how you can interpret it, for example:"
750,I Was Getting Cash And Can'T Get My Card Back.,Considering this utterance: I Was Getting Cash And Can'T Get My Card Back. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

2. The utterances ""The man who shot John Kennedy was Lee Harvey Oswald, a man employed by a Texas corporation called the CIA"" vs ""the man that shot the president was named Lee Oswald and he worked for the agency that's called CIA"". The meaning of the latter is clear, and one would assume a person using such a construction would express his/her meaning without needing to spell the name out? What's the difference between the two? Is the use of a name to denote a corporation a more correct usage than a personal name? If you have to be very specific in naming it and use a specific name, it would seem that it's not necessary to include the word agency. Is that a correct statement? The reason I ask this is I have a friend, whom I respect and who I've known for almost 40 years, that uses the former construction, but when I correct and point out that Lee was his name and Oswald his employment designation (and his employer), he doesn't seem to mind that he was referred to as such.
The difference I perceive is that the second uttering makes sense in that one has to refer to a company or a group for whom Lee worked, while the first utterings only makes complete sense when one refers to an individual person who holds specific positions of power or responsibility with respect to his organization. Am I totally missing something? Are both correct, or are one right and the other wrong? Or would one need to know the person in order to make a determination of correctness? I don't want to offend anyone, if this kind of question is inappropriate, please tell me. I apologize ahead of time for any inappropriate comments. Again, I appreciate your opinion on this issue.

752,My Card Has Been Swallowed By An Atm,Considering this utterance: My Card Has Been Swallowed By An Atm What is the intent that best describes it?,", and is this phrase gramatically correct?

A:
CARD swallowed by ATM
I don't think a single-word phrase is possible without some other information to make it understandable; the phrase CARD swallowed would be understood by only a few people, as it implies that a card was used to enter the ATM (I have to think ""atm"" as meaning ""machine"").
But I think it's a perfectly understandable phrase when you think of what it means. ""Card swallowed"" sounds quite unusual.
It doesn't mean a very literal swallowing in the sense of that, which doesn’t happen. It also doesn' mean that it is swallowed. In particular, it doesn's imply that the card is inside the machine now. So, with the full phrase, ""My card has been swallowed, by an atm, in this very bank"", I'm pretty sure that most people would understand the sentence, though I can see the other interpretation occurring."

This phrase has two nouns and an indefinite article. I'm struggling with how to interpret it because it seems as if there is more than there should be.

A:
(B): The service is not explicitly specified, only the product, which makes it ambiguous. It would be better if it were specified that the one transaction involved a certain product and another product. The ambiguity of the sentence is a reason not to use it in a writing."
757,I Have A Duplicate Payment Showing,Considering this utterance: I Have A Duplicate Payment Showing What is the intent that best describes it?,"rather than a verb or noun?

A:
The phrase means ""I have a duplicate payment in my checking account"".
It is used when a credit card charge is returned because it is an over payment.
Sometimes this occurs because the person charged the wrong amount because of human error (or fraud).
Another reason for duplicate charges is a person using the same credit or debit card twice on the one day or at the exact same time (as far as we can see). Sometimes these can happen at different stores or gas stations."
758,I Made A Payment That Got Charged Twice Instead Of Once.,Considering this utterance: I Made A Payment That Got Charged Twice Instead Of Once. What is the intent that best describes it?,".

If your intent of the above mentioned utterances is ""My card was used for an unauthorized payment"" or ""I made a payment, and then I found out my card had been used, I did not authorize it"" then it is not the correct choice for a title. It is best expressed with a question:
How do I prevent this from happening again?""
You cannot express ""intent"" in a single word or phrase. And this is why you are getting confused. There are many phrases that convey the same thing without being grammatically correct. You are just using the wrong words to convey your point (in this case, you need to use a noun in place of a verb in the question).
""I Made a Payment that got charged twice instead of once"" and ""How to I make sure this doesn't happen anymore""?
These are correct, because the phrase has the word ""is"" to make that the verb is present. The verb ""made"" (as in I made it) is already used in another verb phrase, the one after it, so that you have two verbs. This gives the listener the idea that one verb has completed (making a charge) and that there is some process or action happening (charging). This is a very common structure in English (and other languages as well). It also sounds like you're trying to say that a fee was charged once, but it was actually charged multiple times."
759,What Are My Remedies If I Think I Was Charged Twice For The Same Expense?,Considering this utterance: What Are My Remedies If I Think I Was Charged Twice For The Same Expense? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Is it to ask how to get away with what you did? Or is it that you may think you were charged twice with the same expense?

In this case, the question that seems to best fit the intention is: Can I Get Away With What I Did? As you might guess, what is said may be interpreted differently than the way you think.
What is your interpretation? Which interpretation is most appropriate to this phrase? (It would be a good idea to say what phrase and to what extent each interpretation fits.)"
760,Can I Verify The Source Of My Funds?,Considering this utterance: Can I Verify The Source Of My Funds? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? 
I feel that it has to do with verification but that might be a poor guess or just off the mark. If I were to think about it a bit:   A person asks a question which has an answer that requires verification, then I'm not really sure what it's asking in the first place.

A:
The intent of your question is unclear so here are some examples of what your phrase might mean: I want to verify if you are giving me my money back that my bank gave you, I will be upset if I discover that you don't.  In the context you give it, it is very specific that the only way you can know whether the bank has been giving you back the money is through your bank and their bank. I think these two are more likely: you asked if we could talk to your banker to check, or you want us to give you a receipt that proves the transaction has gone through."
761,I Want Information About The Source Of Funds.,Considering this utterance: I Want Information About The Source Of Funds. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

(C) This utternce is clearly expressed:
How To Do Something About It.
Is the utterence expressed above one of the two? or is there only one? How do you know this for certain? If the answer is only the second one, which is expressed in one word as “How to Do”, then what is this ‘thing’ that one is supposed to ’do‘? And what exactly does it involve? Is it something that people do, or something done by something? Or is it the way we do or think or feel? Why is ”do or don‟t“ used in the expression above? Please answer this question in detail with examples. (I am aware that you can use „do not/must„ or ‚can not or must‚)
If you are asked to express an answer with a single word, in a list or multiple choice test, you cannot use two or more than two word expressions. Therefore the following answer cannot be acceptable: Do You Know? (two words) or You Don‧t Know (one word.)"
762,Where Are My Funds Being Sourced From?,Considering this utterance: Where Are My Funds Being Sourced From? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

If it’s two word, the most likely intent is to communicate ‘funds‘, but it also could be to indicate the source or origin that provides the funds.
For example, if a fund was raised locally, then it would more likely be a one word phrase than a two-word phrase. If the fund were donated in kind, you could have the phrase: “We raised the money to fund….”
“Funding to…..‪#‎localhousen‬„
However, in this case, it seems to be intended to say, ‪›‫‚Funded from the local area‛‖ or‭#￼‌‥‹שׁFund‡s from‮ﾪ,‰﹣‍ａ︱‱螺ﺓ. (the latter is a wordy way to express the latter). The fund is being funded, and from, or where, is implied. In this instance, that implies it is from a bank or other financial institution. But it doesn‟t have to imply bank. It could just be funding that is not being sourced from any particular place or institution as in,
ﻪﱪ
#FundsＡ﯎ﰤ .  .戀′‣:
I could, of course, be wrong. I just don‧t think that the intention is obvious by itself. You would need context to know that, for example. And this kind of thing is one of the things that a spell checker does not do very well."
763,I Would Like To Verify The Source Of My Money,Considering this utterance: I Would Like To Verify The Source Of My Money What is the intent that best describes it?,"? A question? I can't see how, for example, a question could be the most appropriate description. I'm not even sure ""would like to verify"" is necessarily an expression of intent or even an action verb and therefore an appropriate candidate to be classified as an intonation phrase.
I could understand saying something like ""I would like..."" but not ""Would like....""

A:
(Edit) If you look at the examples of the Cambridge Grammar of Spoken and Written English, you find this (from a section on intension vs. extension: 
Intension (a.k.a: ""semantic content"" or simply ""meaning"") is what is expressed by the grammatical forms and word order of a declarative sentence. For example: In English the semantic meaning expressed (by the syntax and grammar) by ""John gave a ball to a dog"" means a thing which (when it occurs) is associated with John and has the property of giving a ""ball"" to (that is, of being given to) a particular animal. In a sentence like this, the lexicographic meaning is of no importance; it is purely semantic that matters. The meaning of John's giving the ball is a matter of convention or agreement. It is not a fact about the nature of things, as are the referential expressions in a non-declaratives (i.e., ""informal"") language.  [my emphasis]
Extension is to do with the properties or circumstances of entities which, when they occur, contribute to the meaning. Extension in the sense of grammatemes and syntactemae (and, therefore, lexemology and syntax, respectively) concerns, not the actual meaning, but how the sentence is interpreted as being ""made true"" by particular instances of particular meanings, or by their co-occurrence. As such, extension is semantic or pragmatic as opposed to intensional or lexical. A simple sentence such as ""My car has a broken light,"" for instance, would make sense even if the brokenlight were a nonexistent car or the light a faulty lamp of some other vehicle. Such instances are, however, quite ungrammatical in most languages. (It is only when we come to ""that the"", or ""if"" and similar ""subordination"
764,Where To Funds Come From,Considering this utterance: Where To Funds Come From What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

(A)
Borrowing money
From someone
C) Where I have saved money for a rainy day
D) Borrow from someone else to pay my mortgage on the house
Answer: B
The best response to what you read would be: “A.” A is a correct response. This is because where does money come from? It comes from one’s savings. (The word from comes before the money).
In the sentence, there is no word that describes the source of money, but it is implied that money comes form someone‘s personal savings and it must come before paying the mortgage.
This is similar to:
What Is The Intent In The Following Sentence. I can“t tell you where it comes
from. Answer: D
A response of: What‚s its source? is also an incorrect response because ‚„its source‛ does not answer the question asked. In this sentence „‹its› source is that a loan is being taken out. So the ‘source  ’of‌ ‹ a loan  ‌is that ‍ it is taken‏ ‐ from someone else  who is lending‮. Thus, ” ‪its s‬ource is ‬borrow‖
※‡ from another, who is lending. Where ?‽ This‟
source  must come before the loan. ‫‫(In ‡this‭lens, the‥source must come‣first. The loan must first come, and so must the―‰source. It‎isn•'s like saying ‛It′comes before it. But‗the source ′is after the ‱″, which is after-it. If the speaker says ‏
""‪where‒its ‒source is, then †he‧is— •talking about the object ‑‾about money.  ‣
So we can put the word…‷†before the loan and place it after its ․․source:"
765,What Is The Source Of My Funds.,Considering this utterance: What Is The Source Of My Funds. What is the intent that best describes it?,".

The intent may appear to be as clear as day: “I have money and I got it from somewhere.”
I may be a little bit more complex. ‘I earned it, I stole it or I borrowed it. I was given it as charity. Or I received it through a government program. But I don’t know the source. Perhaps, it wasn‘t mine, after all it‚??s the government or the church who paid the bills. Maybe it was from the parents, but I am not sure. It‛??is something that I have not worked for or earned. Therefore, my funds were not obtained in a legitimate manner and so, the question remains whether or not they are mine. Is that what I intend to communicate to you when it is just two or three words?
Perhaps the best example of this is ” the rich get richer and the poor get poorer“. That is a perfectly clear intent. And yet, there are those who don't recognize this as an intent at all. They might say‹??‰. So what does our example mean? If you don '„t think that it means the same thing you are missing the most basic aspect of the use of language. We are not going to try to define or describe the complex nature of intent in all but the simplest of terms. The fact that we don „›‖t have to in order to understand your intent will be obvious in the next example. For simplicity we'll say we have two people:
A: I think the man won the game. B: Really? It was so close. Do you have confidence in him?‪‬‡a
B's response is an example that shows a misunderstanding of what the other person meant. If it had been a yes he would have said: ""He played his heart out and did very well‭ ‥‧‱   ‮…"".

766,I Need To Verify My Source Of Funds,Considering this utterance: I Need To Verify My Source Of Funds What is the intent that best describes it?,"? In the previous post, we explored two ways to determine the meaning of an utter. Here, you will see that the answer depends on the intonation, or the voice quality, that modifies the sentence. The words in the utter express the underlying mental intention. For example, a spoken form of I need to, say hello, is Hello, and this form says hello as it is, I have no intentions to change what is said. A spoken phrase like need I to is different from Hello and expresses a different meaning. It is a question that expresses your need and interest in confirming the source of funds you have.

I Need The Amount Of Money You Have In Your Bank Account. You are in a business where you make money and need the amount of money you hold as cash, checking account, savings account or other form you use to hold money. To determine your source, just ask yourself a few simple questions. Did you put the money in your bank account? When was the last time you used the account in order to receive the proceeds of your business? Did the checks you receive come with a receipt for the funds? If you answered yes in any of those instances, then you might not have the right amount if you just used your checkbook when you wanted to know how much money was in that particular place. Also, in some instances of businesses, such as when someone opens a bank, an account is not held by the bank but by a third party. In this case, your intent should be to confirm the name of the business and the place of business in which you deposited the capital, the sum of what you were paid and that should serve you in determining the best way to proceed. If it was you that earned the income on a particular day, do you know the day of month? For instance, if the date on your paycheck was last Friday, did you deposit the pay check on Friday night into your account of choice? And if it did not occur on that date, was it deposited before it, after it or never deposited at all?

I am not sure if this is a good example to illustrate this point, but the following utterances are all about getting a result. (I would like you to have the result you desire)
“I want my money”
(I need my result) “i want to get out of debt’
The above are very similar in that they all ask for something.
My question: Can these utterences also be expressed in the form of questions? (How I would describe my intent would it be?)
What is my understanding? Do I need to change my approach? Can I not ask a question instead of ‘seeking‘ something?  
Thanks
-A
P.S. This question was also asked on ELL.  The top voted answers there seem to think that ”I Would like To see the source of my Money„  is an indirect question. I wonder if it can be rephrased as, „I ask to know where the money comes from‟?
A more direct example is: ‪I think we are not going into any kind of contract‪, ‬‬because, I want, to see, the contract you‚ve signed .‏
This sentence is also a direct question in my mind, because, here, you can say, in other words,‮, that you are‫ asking to find out where your information comes  from. It could be considered‭, as well, ""to see where information  comes form"", or as asking ‚to know‰‌ the  where  information, or the where, or ‛to find  out‴ the  place in which information, is obtained..
As another example, if someone said‍, (how do I)‖›know  how to solve the problem, and you asked,  ‫Where  do  I  get  a  solution  for the equation  x +  2  3 x = 6 , then  you  are  asking  (for a)  source‡  of the answer, as opposed to asking for an  answer, where, the place  or, simply, a‹ way"
768,Why Do You Need All This Information About My Source Of Funds?,Considering this utterance: Why Do You Need All This Information About My Source Of Funds? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

What comes to mind first when you think of this phrase: The only information I’m required to provide about the source of my funds is my income, and I am not required provide any of the other information about myself. That is because I can“launder money through a corporation” without the knowledge of that corporation, but a person cannot do the same because “a person must be disclosed‖ to be declared legally bankrupt.
That is a key point. People can commit a crime, get caught, admit it, pay restitution, do community service, or any other number of things. They can also be forced to pay a fine (e.g., a monetary fine) or even serve jail time. However, they cannot be made to do any combination of these things in a way to ‘hide‘ any one of them, except the income. If they do so, the information is disclosed. The same is true of bankruptcy. As we all know, bankruptcy is different because it is automatic. You have to file a petition, which may require you to disclose information like assets and liabilities. These are public record.
So, a criminal cannot commit bankruptcy fraud. A convicted criminal can do all sorts of other bad things, including lie in order to gain the benefit of a tax exemption, to obtain a job, etc. But they can hide nothing from a bankruptcy trustee, unless the trustee can prove the money came from an unlawful source. (Note: This is where the IRS has a huge interest, since the proceeds of crime are the most likely to come from unlawful sources. In fact, IRS CID has the power to investigate for violations of RICO, as well as bankruptcy and tax statutes.)
It‟s easy to forget that a trustee does not need to prove anything, not do anything to a bankrupt person, that is to say, if they are innocent until proven guilty. It„s not as easy with a convicted person in terms of fraud in bankruptcy (though you have a good argument with tax evasion because they have no income and therefore no tax liability), but the fact remains the bankruptcy statute does require the debtor to tell the truth. This means telling the complete truth, because bankruptcy law does have penalties for lying and/or filing a false case (or petition).

769,How Can I Check The Source Of Funds?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Check The Source Of Funds? What is the intent that best describes it?,", e.g., check?

I've got it in my head that I'd like to write it as:
""How can I check the source of funds to confirm that there are no imposters or hidden agendas?""
Is this grammatically correct? Or should I put ""for"" in between the phrase? And if so does it mean something different? I know that this is asking a lot, but I'm looking for general ideas on correct English.
For example, if ""the source"" and ""checking"" were replaced with any other two word words in English that would convey the same idea, would the sentence also be grammatical? For example: ""how can a check its source?"" ""How do I go about checking my source for impotent funds?"" And is ""I check my sources"" even correct usage? What if I replace the word ""check"" with a verb like ""investigate"" ""analyze"" etc. Would those work? Would ""Check my own source and my family's funds"" be better? ""My sources are the best""? ""Do you check that source""? What's a good phrase for this? 
Or should it be written as ""confirm the identity of the funds that are being used for something""? I've tried to check it by searching ""What if my check is a scam?"" I didn't really know what to search for. ""Scam check source"". But there wasn't anything there. If it is indeed a ""scam"" what should that word be? Is it gramatically correct to say ""It is grammically wrong""? Is ""wrong"" a gramatical verb? Does the ""grammatical error"" have to do with the wrong thing being said? How can one verify that an ""erroneous"" thing is being spoken? Are ""speakers"" considered the ones doing the checking? If there is an online grammar checker is it the speaker's or the grammer checkers? Grammar check website? There are so much questions. I thought I was prepared for it, and so was shocked.

@Dennis-The answer is in your answer. There has been a change in the verb, which is what makes the difference in ""have"" and ""be"". That change means that the subject is now the possessive.
I'm not sure that your other sentence even has a question-form, so I'll have to assume you meant it as ""What is its origin"". (That's an even more difficult question, and you may get the right answer if you figure that out too!)
But it's not a good question at all. This one should have been ""Why are there things that are owned by people?"" That would have the proper focus. It's also an important question: ""Where did I come from?"" means who am I really? It would be more likely to get a ""why should I even care"" response. (There's no such thing as not caring about that question.) But you can see how it might be a useful question in some settings. The question ""Is money an object? Where does it come? Why is there such a thing?"" is not the best question to ask. That one is better. ""But where does all the paper money come?""
You may also be confusing ""possession"" with ""ownership"". ""I own a cat"" is different than ""my cat is mine.""
The second part of your question looks like you don't know why something is owned. Are you asking ""Does money have owners?"" If so, the answer, as I stated in an earlier comment, is ""no."" Money is just like everything else in that it is neutral. Ownership is an adjective, not an adverb. But it applies to a person who owns something, who is their own boss. Money comes from where you work. You're paid by your employer, you get paid. If you want to look for someone who has money, then look at that person. They either have money or they don' t: you won't find it by asking a stranger if"
771,What Is The Source Of My Available Funds?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Source Of My Available Funds? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Does it describe a person, place, or thing? The answer may be difficult to understand from the first-appearance perspective.
The first thing to realize is that there are many ways of putting a thought or a concept onto our minds. Some of these are obvious while others are subtle. When someone says or thinks: “Where do I get my money?”, this may mean different things to different people. It may represent something as simple as ‘I want to know where I can get money’, but in reality the person may have many additional meanings that do not appear on the surface. Here are some possibilities:

I think I should know what I‘m doing. This is a statement which is often used when we feel it is not appropriate to express our true thoughts. For example, someone may use it when they want others to feel more comfortable talking to them. The other person is probably not aware the other meaning. They may feel their thinking is: I think that I know exactly what is wrong with me; I hope this shows through my actions. If you are not comfortable being honest about who you really are, you may choose to use this type of statement to make other people feel better about themselves. You are trying to say things that will make them feel good when, in fact, your thoughts are: My friends don‟t care; They just want me to agree with them
Here is another example. Someone may ask you: Is the answer to my dilemma ′I got this money from my parents‛. In this case the meaning is ‚No, that is just not true‚. He or she may try to hide what they really think and say. I am not going to tell you it“s my own money.„ The person says: That just is my opinion and I want you to respect it. However, the real meaning may actually be, „I really don't know whether or not this is true and, therefore, I don`t want anyone else to believe it either. There are all these different meanings attached to every thought, feeling, action, and so on. Sometimes people try very hard to be understood and when that does not work, they are very likely to put forward a ″thought‹. These thoughts do have real value. We"
772,Can I Find The Origination Of My Funds?,Considering this utterance: Can I Find The Origination Of My Funds? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? 
The first word, i.e.: Can is used for question or inquiry, and is often placed at the beginning of a sentence. So, for this question the first sentence would be: ""Can I find out?"" ""If I have a choice, can I choose?""
Now if you were to look at it as an interjection, what would you say?
It's not very common to use the interjections like Can, So or What, but you do see them used. Can/Can't, etc. However, they're used when the speaker is not able to say/do something, when they are questioning what they can or cannot do, or in a general sense of when you want to express frustration or disappointment. For example, it's common among English speakers to ask for a drink when someone has already ordered their drink in restaurant chains. This is a request for more alcohol, rather than an insult or statement against the waiter.  (see here for an example of Can't vs. can.) You could say to a person that you can't go to bed, that is when your body's saying it needs sleep.
When the second word of the utterances above, find, is also used as the word for ""discover"", you get:

Can it find me? Can they find you? (the two questions are similar)
Find the owner's name? Find out who was in it? You have to find that out. Find her/him?"
773,My Source Of Funds Need Verified.,Considering this utterance: My Source Of Funds Need Verified. What is the intent that best describes it?,"? What do YOU say to explain this intent expressed by that phrase?

A few days ago, a friend told me about someone else who asked me something like this: ""How does a man of science explain a miracle?"" I told him that, in fact, I don't know how a guy of physics explains a phenomenon like a supernova, for example.
I told my friend that I'm not a scientist and that it is not my job to tell people how to do things. But, when some people have no ideas or are confused or ask questions like these, and I answer them, sometimes I use a joke or a story, or if I am in a more serious conversation or with someone older like him, then I try to say that we need to be respectful of other people. I have learned to keep my answers as short as possible...
What do you think I mean? Have you encountered this kind of question? If so, what would you say? I think the first part of the sentence has to stay in the same form that you usually hear it... Is there a rule for this?"
774,What Information Do You Need To Verify My Source Of Funds?,Considering this utterance: What Information Do You Need To Verify My Source Of Funds? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

If the phrase has a noun at the end, the noun is usually the object and this usually means something like:
A verb in this position usually describes the action. If the verb describes a passive action, as in: This car has been stolen
The intent expressed is: to identify the source of the car (car is object).
An adjective in the position described above can also describe an action; this is often seen when describing a product of some kind, or describing how something is used. Here is a sentence to show how it is put in a statement: 
It could also be: My source for information
Here is another example to demonstrate how this might be used: It could be the following: If you want to make sure that the person is reliable to send money to you for something important, you need to ask this question: How can I verify that these funds are coming from the right source?"
775,I Need The Source Of My Funds Verified. How Do I Do This?,Considering this utterance: I Need The Source Of My Funds Verified. How Do I Do This? What is the intent that best describes it?,": to sell to customers?

Can”t Find My Source
You need to verify the source of that money. I can“t find my
source. You need help with that, right? We do not know where any of
those funds came from. Can�‘t you tell me where the money came
from? You„ve got to be able to tell us that.
In the above, you may have heard someone say it this way:
I need the origin of my funds verified. But, did you hear it with the verb: ""To Verify"" or ""I can't verify"" the funds were coming or going? If so, then that‚s correct. Otherwise, it sounds like this: Verifying my origin. It sounds better. ""Verify"" has a specific meaning and is not to prove something. To prove is something else. This is what Verification is. So when you say: Can't you verify my sources, means verify that my source(s) are real. (In this sentence there are only two. )
There are many different words for Verfy: verify, validate, confirm, prove, authenticate, and certify. These words do have specific meanings, as I will discuss later. If you are asking about someone verifying something, that is different. Here, we can use the word confirm. Confirm means to confirm the truth of something: Do you confirm (to) what he had said? That is a confirmation of the original statement. We might say We will verify all of this. or We'll verify everything and come back with a report. That means we‭ will‬ confirm this or that statement by checking it or showing it to you. Or, We confirm your statement in advance about this thing. As a verb. For instance: You should confirm or verify what the contract calls for.

777,Help Me Check Where The Funds Came From.,Considering this utterance: Help Me Check Where The Funds Came From. What is the intent that best describes it?,", such as ‘Get the money…’? This question is important because, as we go through the various ways that a person could give a request for cash, we need to know which way to interpret such a command. Let‘s say that this person asks his or her spouse to get some money. What do we think is intended from the phrase?

“Help Me Find Out Where My Funds Have Gone”
(Intent – Obtain knowledge)
The phrase implies that the person who has received the request is curious and, through further investigation, might be able to determine the source of the funds. He or she does not expect the spouse immediately to provide the answer; in fact, it would be quite a lot of work and it might take a fair bit of time before any results are obtained.
However, this phrasing would not imply that he or (or she) would expect to receive immediate response, so it does imply the need for the recipient to find out the facts. This request would most likely be asked in a calm and quiet manner as opposed to screaming or shouting, which would imply a demand. If this were to occur, he (it‚ÇŹs she‖Äú would need patience, and the other party might even need time to understand the urgency of what is being asked for. Once this is understood, however, the demand would also most often be met. So, if the husband or wife does decide to check where he funds have gone, then the wife can tell him the amount was spent on her mother‟s car or that it was needed to take her son to the eye doctor. The intent of a sentence that reads, “Can you help me check…?‰ř is different from one that might read,„Please Help. It seems that my funds are being withdrawn without my permission.›Àž, because the former implies the question of „what are we going to do with the info?ÌŒ while the latter is a direct request. As a final thought, I‡‹d like to point out that, in these examples, you might want to read ‚‬‒†check as in †‗check into,Ó to indicate a thorough and careful effort to"
778,I Want To Know Where The Funds Come From.,Considering this utterance: I Want To Know Where The Funds Come From. What is the intent that best describes it?,".

A: To make a statement with a purpose of getting information
B: Get info on where money comes from
C: Find info regarding how money is created
D: Want to know how the money gets to me and/or where it went
e.g. A is more open-ended in the question than D, with the intention to have more information available when you answer. The intention in A might be something like:
""Where did you get that from""
The answers to the questions in B and C are more closed-off, the answers in D more vague and open to interpretation. B is usually expressed in a way similar to ""how"".
You may also look for other expressions to express your intention: ""To ask"", ""where did he go?"", ""what did they do?"", or ""who are they?""."
779,What Is The Source Of My Money?,Considering this utterance: What Is The Source Of My Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Do you see it as having two possible meanings, or one meaning? Is there any way that the speaker was referring to a single source, as in money from, for example, a government or the government? Or does the sentence imply that there is more than one person from whom the listener received the money? If you think about it, the words used in the expression can have more meanings than the phrase would imply. The words “is’ and ‘of” in this case can also take on more specific meanings.

If you do not see the meaning as two separate meanings for the whole expression, then you will probably find some way to interpret these words in their separate senses as being in a relationship with each other as if they had different meanings to them. If a writer wants a reader to get both meanings by using one expression he can use the word ”of and is“. Or he could use a word such as „from‟, which also indicates two objects. For instance, one could say ‚I received my car from my father„. This sentence implies that a father is a source for someone‚s car. A more common example is †I am writing this from home.‖ This implies home as my source or from the place that I am in currently. Another example would be ‗‘I went to work from school. ’‛, in which case you might find a teacher is referring more specifically to school as her source. So you can see that one can refer to multiple sources or sources that may or may not be known by the person speaking. However, when a person speaks about their money he is usually referring one source of money, and most likely more people than just one. Here I will try to explain what one refers to as the source in more detail.


There are two ways to describe what a ‬source of (any type of) money is: 1.) A person or people, (a ‪source,‬) who is able to provide money to another person, either through giving that person money directly, giving him or her money for work done, providing them something of value, etc. 2.) the way the income is received. When one receives his money in another way, it doesn‗t matter how, but simply the"

Intent – A plan for achieving something
The best definition of the word I can find is: to think, wish, or intend; intend to make or be; will; wish or choose; purpose; resolve or intention.
How does the context of this statement help you to know what the speaker’s intent might be? You are likely to guess a range of possible meanings and then make an educated guess at the most likely. If you could ask the other party the same question, would you get the exact same response? Probably not; however, most people would probably give the “right” answer. But how can you be certain? And if your guess is off, how could the situation possibly be improved? The answers to these questions are the foundation of developing a successful communications approach and a good strategy to help improve your organization‘s ability to communicate. It is called strategic management of strategic communication. Strategic management is defined as the application of an organizing process that focuses on the creation of organizational goals and the execution of a strategy that is appropriate for the particular situation. Strategy, defined by Collins Dictionary, as: a plan or methodical course of action for accomplishing a particular goal; a method or process for getting an organization to a state. The organization is your company, your team, a project or even a single person. I will discuss the communication aspects of strategy later on. First, let‟s look at some other aspects that should be considered when you are working with others. A few years ago, I worked for a company with over 1000 employees. There were a lot of different departments and sub-departments throughout the company. We were divided into four groups. One group was responsible for marketing, another for sales, one for operations, and another that was more in between. All of these four departments had their own unique objectives for each of their subdepartment areas. Then, the marketing group had its own subgroup for research or R and D, this one group also had another sub group for new markets and products or NMP. In addition, each department had a number of subgroups within their department such as, Finance, Human Resources, Training & Development, Legal, IT, etc., Each of those sub groups had it„s own objective for their specific department, plus there were individual objectives that"

This is my best attempt at it:   I have to verify the source of my funds.  This is not a very well thought out question and would be thankful for any help.

A:
The best word-for-word translation would probably look something like: ""I'm going to have my bank (or other financial institution) verify whether or not the money that I'm getting from this guy is real."" I think that the phrase ""have to"" conveys the feeling that you're a little uneasy about it in case some bad thing has happened. For example, ""we can't let him leave until he's confirmed his bank account,"" would convey the same information. The key word there is ""can't.""
Your phrase may also imply that this person gave you the cash to give to the person who's selling the car. So you need to make sure that they're really your bank so that there's no fraud going on. This may be true in your case, but it doesn't necessarily have anything to do with verification. It could also be that ""verification"" means ""to see if they really have the bank to back up their claim, and, if not, to tell them."" In other words, verify to see for sure."

In this video, we'll discuss some parts of the sentence: this is a perfect passive sentence, this sentence has an adverbial phrase, and there are three parts to it: first there is this, then there's that, followed by it's like this.
So this part would be the subject, I am a professor. This part is called the objective case, it describes who or what is being talked about. Then there’s that part, which is just a prepositional phrase which can go as the topic sentence or the conclusion of your essay. It can also be a supporting idea or a subtopic sentence. And then, there it is – the final part and it‟s like that. Let‘s see what it means. We have a sentence – I”m a teacher. You“re looking for someone to teach. But what„s the difference? You can look for it yourself. Look for the teacher you need – it could be you‚re talking to a friend. The word ‚it›s can be used as an object. I have my friend‰s help.

it that it, its physical body, is in control? This thinking and feeling is also a choice that we can make in order to see
and be. We can see that life around us is so much more than we think it to have been, than that the senses give it out
to us. Life is everywhere, around and inside us, everywhere. To find your own place, we will need something
which is always here with us; your thoughts, our feelings and our senses are what create our sense of place and we are in the
world and in our place all the time. Your choice, thoughts and feelings control your place in your surroundings."

I have no idea what to tell you, other than the word “funds.” You might want to look more closely at the question itself and ask why you feel the need for this. Maybe a more specific question will provide you with a better answer. Good luck, and take care of yourself. 🙂

Note the downvote - is there some sort of irony I’m missing? 🙂 I don't see anything that looks off. I will reword to clarify, this person was asking about a specific source, so my response was about the nature of that source. The point is I didn't answer the OP's question. If the answer is ""no, there is nothing wrong with the way you asked that question,"" then that is what I provided. It was not an explanation that there was nothing else to offer. As I said, I was offering no explanation. But I'll edit my original reply to add more detail. –

As you are an expert at this site, can you answer this question? Thank you in advance. Is the sentence: ""I'd like to buy a computer"" a grammatically correct statement?
And the correct answer: Yes. Thank You. Now for another question…Is the statement ""How do you make the most effective use out of what time you have each day, while keeping your priorities straight?"" gramaticaly correct? Also, the ""while keeping…?"" is in bold. Thanks for your help!

What is this ""the"" in the bold? Is it necessary in this context? Could it also be ""a/any"", or ""that""?
Yes, it's correct, ""The"" is necessary, unless the context of ""how do I make a good use of..."" suggests otherwise. And yes, that's right as well, as the entire phrase could be rephrased, if need be. So, no need. Have fun learning! –"
787,Where Are My Funds Coming From? I Need To Know.,Considering this utterance: Where Are My Funds Coming From? I Need To Know. What is the intent that best describes it?,": to inform, to warn, or to command: ""Where Are my Funds (coming from)?"" This phrase will help identify the underlying meaning of what is said. It is best to state the question in the past tense, as ""I need to know"" as opposed to ""need to have"".

The phrase ""where are my funds coming from"" is a good question and question to ask if one is concerned with how the business owner is making his or her money. This is because there may be something to be concerned about. The question may also be important when dealing with any potential investors or creditors. There are two major reasons why ""what's the source of my money"" would be an important question for an individual to answer.
First, it would identify an owner's sources of income. For instance, a person that is working in a corporation is an employee. They have a boss, and their salary is provided by that boss. Thus, the employer is where the income is coming. On the other hand, an independent contractor is not directly responsible for where his money comes from. He could have an agreement with someone to pay that money, be it for a certain sum of money or a percentage of any profits he may make. An individual could also come across a windfall and receive money without having any obligations. That would not be his job, so his salary may not come from his company, but from the person he came into contact with. These are the major situations where ""who pays the money I get"" can be answered. If he is receiving money from an employer for the time that he spends working for them, then the answer would simply be ""my employer"" to the ""source question"". If an investor pays him to work, his answer may change to reflect ""me"". An independent consultant does not get paid by the hour. His salary or fees may vary according to agreement, such as what his performance is worth. A wind fall may come through a personal encounter; this is also referred to as an ""earner"" or even a ""gift"". These individuals can also answer the following question with similar answers:
Where do you work?
Who employs you? (if not me)
Do you have any other income besides this, like investment income? If so,what is it? And where does it come in?"
788,Where Has My Available Money Come From?,Considering this utterance: Where Has My Available Money Come From? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? (You can use the “What is…” prompt below in the free practice section.)

The first phrase below, ‘’Where has my money been invested?,‘ is probably an example of a question about financial affairs, and the second phrase, where has the money come from?, is more clearly a statement of belief.
You may be more familiar with ”Where does my available money go?“ which is a more common, or traditional, version of the latter. The two versions of this question have the same intent, but the former puts the emphasis more on money being available, while the later puts more of that on what is invested."
789,Why Do You Need To Know Where My Money Is Coming From?,Considering this utterance: Why Do You Need To Know Where My Money Is Coming From? What is the intent that best describes it?,":

""Why Do you need to know from where my money comes"".
What does the author of the utterances intent is he trying to express?
How can I express it as the same meaning without using the word ""need""?
If I use ""Why do you have to ask"" what does that mean? Why can't you ask? What's wrong with asking? 
Or, maybe: ""You know what I mean - why do I need you to get it right?"" or ""Are you sure you got it straight?""
Does the answer help you answer my original question? Does this make it clear what is intended to be expressed? Am I overthinking it? Is this too broad? Or am I simply being pedantic? Do people just say it all the time and not mean it at all? If so, why? I'm a writer and this is very confusing.
(I hope this all makes sense).
Thanks.  


A: It is a very odd expression. ""The money"" (of my ""money"") ""comes from me"", the ""bank"". That's why I asked. But it's not quite ""why do we need it to have correct information?"": that is ""How do people know we have the information?"", ""do we just tell them?"", etc, etc. It's ""Do we trust the bank?"", a bit of a joke, a kind of rhetorical question. The money, and I trust that's where the money is coming from. There's something odd, or at least the expression is odd. I think it is meant in a rhetorical tone, to show the speaker has some degree of confidence in the person who will answer the question, so there is some level of trust. And if you don't have that level you might need the other person to explain and clarify. A simple question is probably not meant to convey so much, it just shows that you care."

791,How Can I Check The Source For My Funds?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Check The Source For My Funds? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
The phrase expresses a feeling of dissatisfaction and doubt.
If you have an intent of ""I am feeling discontent"", ""how can I check the source for all of my funds?"", then the context of your thought will tell you how to construct the question. For example, ""How can they trust them when so many of their own have been corrupted in the past?"" is a very different question from ""What is this new thing they are offering that I do not want a part"" or ""Is the new investment offering too good to be true?""
I think, but cannot definitively say, that ""source"" is an adverbial and you should use ""where"" to modify the noun ""money"". The sentence ""This investment sounds suspicious. Where will I get my money?"" would be similar to ""They said it was safe. When is it coming?"""
792,Where Can I See The Source Of My Money?,Considering this utterance: Where Can I See The Source Of My Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? What does this phrase mean?

There are many phrases in everyday speech that have the same meaning as the English translation of this Hebrew phrase. For example: Why Can’t You Be More Like Dad? (Why can‘t you be more like your dad?), What Do You Mean, It‟s Over?/It Won”t Make A Difference. (What do you mean, it won„t make a difference? / You mean it will just make me feel worse?). We could ask a person or a student to think through this expression and write it down in English. They would write something like „I want to know where I can SEE the source of my money (food, clothing, shelter, health care, etc.)“ or “I don‛t really care where the food comes from, I just want it to be there (in front of me), I want what I see it (it) doing.‪‡‚ What‌s happening?‬ Where‖s it going? Is it good? Can you see (understand) it? Where does it come from? Do you know about it?""
A person can easily ask about money, food, or shelter and be satisfied with what they are told. Why does the person have questions? Why do they wish to understand the process of providing these things? For some people, this is a very natural, even if frustrating, question.
It could be that we want the student s question to ‚show‹ that they do know, because their question implies that the answer to it, is ‘yes, they know. It can also be because we may not know the ‛whys‰ about their own question that is bothering them. This question can be difficult to ask because of the fact that ’money (etc.) is not always available at will. Therefore, we might say, ”Well, the money isn—t available right in front me and I do have to go and get more―

The answer is that in a formal language, you can write about the whole world including the facts that the money is from a job, and it comes in through the front door (i.e., your wallet), whereas in the informal language of a conversation, the speaker might have only one of two facts, namely that his money comes from his paycheck, from which he has to take out money for rent, food, etc.
But in English, if the subject of the sentence is mentioned by an object relative pronoun, then the object can often be omitted, so the following sentences are very similar:
I got my lunch from school today. (subject omitted)

How Can Check Funds
Incorrect: how can check funds

A: We can see how this happened, but we don't know who. We should find out, however. You have just lost five million dollars and you are the only one that can help.
I was a little bit curious about how to check whether a check is valid or not. So I have been reading some of your comments on different topics.

Why Am I Seeing This Fee Now?  I Am Not Happy About This At All. What is the intent that best describes it?","?

A:
This answer is for those that may encounter this type of question in the future.
I am not 100% sure if this answer applies only to Chinese people, but I think that there will be a lot of people who use the Google translator when they have a question. So I will try to provide a general answer for this phrase. I may have made some mistakes, and if so, please feel free to correct me. Also I do not claim to be an expert of Chinese language, so feel absolutely free that you can correct anything that I got wrong. Please tell me!
The most accurate phrase that describes the fee that appears after you transfer money in your PayPal account can be translated as ""Paypal charge"", which can also be expressed in other ways. For example, this is what the PayPal site will show on your account page: ""Paid. You can only transfer in or out the amount that’s left in this account."" In this case, the ""You"" refers to you the user of PayPal. It is like this because if it did not show like that, PayPal would have to pay to the banks or whoever you sent money to with a charge. In other words, after transferring, you get a fee. This is exactly the meaning of the phrase ""charge"", and it has nothing to do with ""the intent"".
Now let's talk about Chinese! It seems that the way people use this word in Chinese also varies. Some people will use it to refer to all fees, some use other specific words. Like the Chinese person in my question, I only use ""pay fee"" when it specifically refers the above-mentioned fee in PayPal that we talked about. But I am also familiar with some people that used this term for other fees. Therefore, ""to pay a pay fee"", in some cases, will have the same meaning as the word ""fees"". The only thing that is different is that sometimes it will also express something else, such as, in English, we usually use a word which has only one meaning. While the one that has many meanings is used to say different things. The most commonly used"
798,I Got Charged And Extra Fee When I Transferred Money So Why Was I Charged?,Considering this utterance: I Got Charged And Extra Fee When I Transferred Money So Why Was I Charged? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Is it to complain, complain about or tell someone about the matter or something else?

A:
In the case of I got charged for this..., ""I"" is probably referring to oneself. The use of ""for"" here makes it seem like the action is a charge being incurred for that one's own benefit. However, in the phrase: you get charged when you..., the person being asked about getting charged is implied from the context. ""You"" might not refer to self, but it could be referring, at least, to a group of people.
Another similar example: You got it charged to your credit card, not your own."
799,Can You Explain The Transfer Fee To Me?,Considering this utterance: Can You Explain The Transfer Fee To Me? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Do you think this was a request for clarification, a rhetorical question, or something more?

This one: You've Got Mail. The intent of this, in my opinion, is to inform me that this person is aware of the mail (email) that I sent to him and that he has read it.
In a formal business environment, this may have been considered rude or condescending. In informal situations or when the sender isn't aware that the recipient has seen the message, I believe it is more a statement of fact. If I were the senders, however, it would be a question of intent; I would need to clarify whether the person was actually reading the messages I was sending."
800,Will Salary Be Received Through This?,Considering this utterance: Will Salary Be Received Through This? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

1

2

801,How Can I Get Paid In A Different Currency?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Get Paid In A Different Currency? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The speaker is expressing a desire that the other person should be willing to pay him or her in some other currency, in other words, he or she is asking for payment in a different currency to the one he has been accepting so far.
This means that it is in your best interest to be able to express these two phrases well because it can be a very powerful way of establishing rapport, and you might be surprised by the impact that this can have on the way that people respond to you in the future. It would not be very common for someone who says it to actually get paid in anything else but the currency they are speaking. For example, “How can I get the $20 that you owe me?” is unlikely to get you $ 20 in exchange as is, although someone might reply ‘I’ll give you 10 more in cash.‘
It‚Äôs important to think about all of the various ways in which people interpret what you say, how the words you use are connected to their context. If it‡Å¡s hard to explain why it makes an impact, try doing it over email, or in person. This is a great exercise to practice on before speaking publicly. The way you talk about money impacts how people feel about you, which then impacts your own ability to establish rapport with people.

802,Can I Receive My Salary In A Currency Other Than What It Is Deposited In?,Considering this utterance: Can I Receive My Salary In A Currency Other Than What It Is Deposited In? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

This is a difficult question to answer for several reasons. In addition to the obvious fact that the answer to this question is highly subjective, it is possible that there is not one single, objective answer. There may in fact be many different ""intent"" answers for which to one person ""I can receive my salary in a currency other than that which it was deposited in"" is, and to another person it could be, "" I cannot receive more than what was paid to me"". The following are a few possible interpretations of this type of question.
Let's begin with one of the more obvious answers to our question: I am the boss and I say, in as many words, that I will let my employees have a choice as to how they want to be paid. Now, if these people are smart, they'll choose the currency in which I have deposited their salaries, because it will result in the most favorable exchange rate to them. Thus, I should be willing to let them keep their money in that currency. The alternative to that, however, is that they are stupid, so I would simply say they don't know what they have done and take back every cent of wages deposited by their actions. To me, the first interpretation is more appealing. I can't think of a situation where I want an employee to lose something of value. (Unless the employee is my wife, of course, but then I'd have to give her divorce papers. ;-) I hope this helps to explain the ambiguity of what the phrase really means. But I guess there's more to it than meets the eye, as usual."
803,Can I Get My Salary Through This?,Considering this utterance: Can I Get My Salary Through This? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
If you are asking if it is about the phrase or the intended action, it sounds like you should ask yourself: is this something I should do? It can be a good question to ask when you want to know if you have a legitimate reason to take some or all of your salary through a company (rather than leaving it, for example).
To me, the question is a bit awkward because it's a request and the answer is not ""yes, you can"".
So the better question here is, ""should I take my salary in cash?"" That's the ""can"" question, and you'd ask it like this: does this benefit me?"
804,How Can Someone Send Me Money?,Considering this utterance: How Can Someone Send Me Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? And, what is it really asking? The answer may be a surprise if you are asking yourself. You may not be thinking of anything in particular or may have never given the question any thought at all!

In the first paragraph there is a hint in the sentence How Did You Send Money. As soon as these words are spoken, you think of “send” and not necessarily money. In the next sentence you get more information about your intent. The question asks How. It is not about how I sent money but more a question of how. How is my money sent? This could be money I send myself, money for someone, for some purpose.
There are more examples to show you the difference of thinking and how you could change the meaning of the words. Let me know what you find."
805,Is There A Problem With Receiving My Salary In Gbp?,Considering this utterance: Is There A Problem With Receiving My Salary In Gbp? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

Is there a problem with receiving your salary in Gbps? What kind of problem is that? The problem may be with the amount or the source of the money.
In the present context, it is a sentence to show that I am concerned that he is about to be fired or that you are about do something that should not be done. That is why, for example, this sentence may have a slightly more emphatic meaning than this one, Is there There any problem when you receive your pay in dollars? In that sentence, the speaker wants to know what the situation is when he will be paid, and the verb is in passive voice
This one is slightly less emphatical than the second one; that is to say, in this example I would have the feeling that your problem should be solved, as you may not have enough of money or you want to have your own money, or there is an amount problem. 
I think that these two sentences are very similar, but for an example:
1. Is this a good practice of a company?  No
2. This isn't the right place to complain about the company. It is not the place for you to talk."

As a writer who‘s trying to figure out if my content was good or not, I found the article titled, “5 Key Points I Learned from a Writing Instructor in 2 Minutes.” What do I think is being said there? The author wants to convey her message by means of a short statement with an example, and the point is, she‚d like to make her point clear to the reader. So, what‟s she going to try? What„s the message or the idea she wants the readers to understand from the piece?
In this short article, the author talks about five points she learned from an instructor during a conversation. To help her get her idea straight to her readers, here are the points and their meaning that she conveys in this piece:
#1. Use clear points to connect readers with your article
A clear and concise sentence helps to explain the topic of the story. As the writer, you don‛t need to force to have a long sentence. If you have to write a lot of words for the sake of having a lengthy sentence, then you‗re probably trying too hard. A long, drawn out, or unclear sentence can put readers off. They can get confused. Also, it can cause them to not read the entire sentence or article. When you think you need a really long or long-winded sentence for a reader, just ask yourself this question and you may find that your message is better delivered with one sentence than with several paragraphs. Just keep it simple. You can always add to it later, but if you go too long to do it, don't worry about it. The key is to give readers what they want and need and keep them interested. Don t over do the details, unless you are writing a technical piece. Keep it short. Make it quick. This will keep your readers reading and enjoying your piece to finish. And, most importantly, they won“t be able to stop reading till they get to your conclusion. Then, at least they will have some idea about what the whole story is about. Now they should be more interested and want to read some more"

I have been a member of the IHSA volleyball community for over thirty years. In this time I can recall no instance when a team that won a regional championship did not go on to play for a state championship; it has to be the most coveted sports trophy in Illinois and the nation.
There is just too many good coaches, players and administrators that I have come in contact with to believe that any team will not take it all the way to a State title. The only difference I see between today’s state tournament teams and those that have won in the past is that the coaches now have the opportunity to coach at an elite level. It just takes that one good team, and I believe there will be a few that rise to the occasion. I am not sure if the level of competition is as high as it was in decades past, but in my view it is a lot better than it used to. My first experience in high school was with a great Illinois team in 1976. We won the Illinois State Championship that year. Since that time the quality of play improved and it seems to keep getting better as the years go by. Today we have a much better understanding of what it takes to get to state, the talent level is high and coaches are not afraid to take their teams where they want them to go. But you still have to have good teams with strong individuals to reach that pinnacle. And, as you know, it could even happen this year with some of these good squads. As a coach I would be honored to participate in this state volleyball tournament and take my team to win state. This tournament is not just about one team. A team can”t win the tournament if they are in a bad place during a conference tournament. To do well in state a whole team must be in good place. That is why in basketball teams can finish at the top of their conference and still win a national title if there is an exceptional team on the opposite side of them. Illinois volleyball is very similar. There is too much talent around the state to make a judgment on any of those teams in regards to how far they will go in an I-State Tournament. Let‟s hope that this will bring out the best in each"

A:
This question was posted by the OP in the following comment: 
Comment from ""user29172368"":
The word ""received"" is used in a manner synonymous to the verb ""take."" It is a present participle that is being used after an action that has been completed.  The word is in this sentence synonymous with the phrase ""has been received.""  This means that the money has already been transferred, in fact, the transfer might already have occurred when the statement is made.

815,How Do I Get My Salary In The Account?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Get My Salary In The Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?
Is it to describe how the person in question got their salary, or to tell them where it's located? Is it used to ask where a person gets their money from? Does the word ""Where?"" need to be included? If a better description is needed, should the sentence be written with or without that word.
I'm trying to figure out if I need a ""where"" at the beginning of the question, because I'm not sure if the ""in"" means ""from where"" is where the money comes from. 

A:
When it is a question about a job, you don't need an ""is"" before ""get"". Instead, a verb that indicates a process would be better. So ""How do I get to work?"" would mean ""how does one get a salary?"" or ""what is done with one's salary"".
In this case, I donít think it matters much. Both sentences are fine, and there is no reason to add in ""or where?""."

How would we know? We are not in the position to know. We do not have the ability to directly observe what is going on inside the minds of the people who are giving and taking such a transaction. So we can only observe the external manifestation.
We can make reasonable guesses based on the available evidence from the outside. But even our best guess may be wrong due to all of our fallibility, and the fact that we do have a mind of its own. It is a difficult enough problem as it is, without us adding to it by our own ignorance.

A:

If you're looking for ways to translate it to your specific currency that is more accurate, this answer by ChrisF is a good example. As far as the translation of it as one word or more, a common approach is ""GBP/USD"":
GB: Great British Pound (UK currency)  
USD: US Dollar (a US currency used in many countries around the world)
The ""/"" character means that these are two completely separate currencies."
824,How Can My Friend Transfer Money To Me?,Considering this utterance: How Can My Friend Transfer Money To Me? What is the intent that best describes it?,"There is a great deal of confusion surrounding what you might call the concept of intent. So much so, in fact, that even those who teach the topic often don’t even know what it is. It‘s not hard to figure out that it has something to do with the meaning of an utterances.
In everyday speech, people often express this by saying “I mean this to mean that“. The most obvious meaning when we use this is to say ” I am making a general statement about what is meant by something that I say, but I don't want to commit to a specific interpretation.”
A related concept is that of sarcasm. In many cases, sarcasms are based on what they call ‘hidden‚ or „hidden meanings‟. This is where what people say is not meant to be taken literally. For instance: When someone says ‚I love you‛, what he is really saying to his loved one is: ‬I‹ am willing to die for you. But that does not mean he does really mean it. He is ’making a joke‌. A lot of people are very good at telling jokes with this hidden meaning. We all know jokes can be sarcastic, which is why we don`t understand when someone tells us the story of ‭The Man Who Died For Nothing. ‏
If someone is speaking in an ironic tone, it's probably safe to assume that he means one thing but says something else that is completely different. There is another kind of irony in which a person is making fun of someone else, while the speaker himself is taking it seriously. An example of this might be a friend of whom you say ""I can't believe he's so silly,"" while you are talking to another person. If you really meant: ""Oh, I really can‮believe‬ he‭is‪ so‫silly‰,"" you would be using sarcasming. That, of course, would mean something entirely different than what a speaker intends. Another example might include someone saying ""That guy is so stupid, he needs to have a brain transplant"" while thinking: 'Boy, am I glad that guy doesn't have one.'
So, to answer your question, if I want a loan,"
825,Can My Friends Send Me Money?,Considering this utterance: Can My Friends Send Me Money? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? It sounds a bit like “Are you my friend”. I think the first question in the mind of the hearer would be: Is the speaker your friend? The answer to this will determine what you are looking for in a friend. If the answer is no, then your question will be about an investment of money. You may ask for something, like a favor, help, etc. The most common intent will likely be asking for money, especially if the word ‘friend’ was included.

The word can is included to make the sentence sound formal. We do this in English to show that a request is made to someone. However, it can easily be interpreted as being a question. It also has been said that asking a child if they want something can be misconstrued as if you were asking if your child wanted something. (A child may not know that you would not ask them a direct question like that). I‘d like to share a different way of thinking about the question that can and friend could be used together. First the meaning of friend and the different kinds of friends should be defined and then how the words used in this phrase interact with the definition should also be considered. For this example, I decided to focus on the two main categories of Friendship: Social and Family. Then I will discuss a little bit about money for the sake of this analysis. Social friends are people to whom we have shared our experience for some time. These people are in our family. They are not blood relatives. There might be a time when you did not really know them or have spent that much time with them, but still, they are your friends and we do consider them as friends. Family friends, or family members, are the family blood and you do not need to tell people who they might have known, unless you really want to know for educational purposes. But in real life, most of us consider family as blood, even if we don‟t really like them that often, we still consider it as important to maintain our blood ties. So, if I were to think about this as an equation, this would look like the following:
If you want friends you have to be someone people want/need to have as friend, while for Family you just have be there. Therefore, to get friendship you must provide people with a"

Does your mind jump to a specific answer? I hope so. If so, then you have already made a step towards understanding grammar. Grammar is simply the art of making the right choice of words based on your thoughts. Let’s take a look at that question and find out what this is all about.
1. “Can I...” and ”I Can... ‘ is a common example of the use of present tense. The question here is not asking about permission now but rather about a future action. We can use either present or past form for this question:

I can... – This means I have not yet done this action that I want to do and I can do that action in the future. Therefore, present should be the better choice here. You would be using present form to mean that the action of depositing your salary to the bank account is something that you are planning to perform now, so I suggest using the present-tense form: ’Can you deposit your…
Can‘s and Can't are two common English words that have a slightly different meaning. When the word „Can"" appears in combination with a verb like can, can't, may, might and should, it usually indicates a choice between alternatives or possibilities. These words also work as negative expressions. In these cases, ""can't"" indicates something is absolutely false or impossible and ""may"" suggests that something might happen, but it is uncertain. ""Must"" is another kind of negative word and is used to express a command or instruction. It means ‚You must... '.
For the question, I am in no position to make a decision on behalf of you or to tell you what you can and cannot do, or rather which is right and what is wrong for you. So, the choice is up to you and to no one else. That is why I say the words can‚€™t have any meaning in relation to this sentence. I simply mean to emphasize the fact that there are no rules to follow or standards or criteria by which to measure the quality of your choices. They are choices as much as your opinions. Do you like broccoli? Then you must eat broccoli. Can you choose something for yourself? Yes and no, depends on what kind you want. But you need to be careful"
829,How Do I Get My Salary Through This Account?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Get My Salary Through This Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

Answer
In this example, the first part of the sentence conveys a simple fact. ""How do I?"" shows a need to ask a question. The second part conveying the answer is not a complete sentence. It is an incomplete sentence and is often called a clause. A clause is a combination of two or more sentences with an auxiliary, adverb, preposition, or other type of a sentence (or group of sentences). The complete clause ""This account"" is used to describe what kind of account this is. In short, it means the account belongs to the person and he or she will get his or her salary from it."
830,What If I Need My Salary In A Different Currency?,Considering this utterance: What If I Need My Salary In A Different Currency? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The intent of the phrase, „What if I need my salary in a different currency?“ is to give the speaker a hypothetical situation and ask the listener how they would react if faced with that circumstance. The listener would interpret this speech as an emotional experience that the person is willing to risk. Therefore, the most common answer to this question is “I would panic.”
You can express the emotion of a person by the way you say something. In this case, when you want to express anxiety, you should use the words in order to make that happen:
1. ”I have to go to Mexico. I will be gone for two weeks. Do you have enough money to buy me a new refrigerator? ‘What? I'm in Mexico? How can I buy you a refrigerator when I don't have dollars? What if, God forbid, something happens? The refrigerator breaks in my home. Now, there will have no food in the refrigerator to eat. How are you going to help? You are a man. You have two legs. No, I cannot ask you to borrow money from your father. He is a proud man, he would never lend me the money. That leaves you. So I’m asking you for the loan.
2. It's been raining and I have been waiting for my bus to come to my house in this neighborhood all day. Finally, it is about seven o'clock in evening and it's time to leave. As always, my father is in no hurry to pay my debt of gratitude and he is waiting in his car. When he sees me coming to his side, his face changes like he just saw the last piece of evidence on his worst nightmare. Oh God, what if he asks to see my new car? Will he be able to understand that I owe some debt to him? It is so late in night. Will it be possible to do the business before tomorrow morning? So what? We have lots of time. Let him say what he wants. If he makes a big deal out of it, we are both in trouble. At the end of day, let's just enjoy a dinner at a restaurant. After all, today is our last day on Earth. My father will probably be waiting at the table with a gun in one hand and"
831,I Receive My Salary In Gbp. Do I Need To Configure This Somehwere?,Considering this utterance: I Receive My Salary In Gbp. Do I Need To Configure This Somehwere? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Is there a different nuance/mood to it?

If you were asked to provide your best guess as to what you'd expect someone to say if they wanted to ask about the nature of the relationship between the person who says the utterances and someone else:
1) Who? (Person A, Person B, or Person C?);
2) What?;
3) Where? and
4) When? Would you expect either A) Person A and Person
B) B and C) A or B? or C?) Or would you assume it's not a question you had to expect an answer to at all? Or is there something you can assume about it without knowing the context in which it would be said? For example, you would know that there is something in common between Person I and B but not A.
It's probably easiest to assume that this kind of question is not meant to be answered directly; rather, your response should be about something else. For an example you might be asked about a person to see whether you recognize or associate them with a given context. It's possible to use it as an indirect question, but it has the same problem that it can be interpreted as something it isn't meant for and you wouldn't want to give an unhelpful answer if it were so asked. But the question might have an entirely different, unrelated intent. I'm pretty sure there's no way for you to know for sure and if you don't know what the other person is going to do with the answer it might very well be better to just say something that shows you understand there are many different kinds of questions and that you didn't understand the situation as you've presented it. Or it could be the case that the only possible answer is one the others would consider stupid, and they might just think you'll give them the stupid answer regardless of your intentions, so there may not be any point to responding at that point. 
For a general answer on how to deal with such questions in general, I'd have to look in my personal copy of How To Ask Questions The Smart Way but this question on the subject is a good starting point: Why are some questions closed as off-topic but other questions are open?"
832,Do You Know If I Can Use This For My Salary?,Considering this utterance: Do You Know If I Can Use This For My Salary? What is the intent that best describes it?,". For example: I do not have to do it, because I can do this work by myself.

A question about the verb, to can. In the first statement, the speaker says, he can, which is a present perfect continuous verb meaning I have a way; I've been doing it that way. He can also mean, I will do, or I'm going to get. To say I'll can or will can can mean I already have or am going
to get to, but if I had to say it in that context, then I'd have no choice but to use the will version. You can use will to mean that there is no alternative. It's a strong construction in which there are no conditions that preclude the thing from happening. Will can be used in the following: You won't have an accident
while using the brakes. The police will arrest the person who stole that car. There are people who can drive the car, and people like you and me who cannot. I am not going out tonight because the snow is too bad, so I think I won’t be able to make it there. And there
are times when will is used with verbs expressing past action. If you've ever said, ""I can't, will you"", you are using this form. These verbs include can take a -ed form:
I will go. They went. We went to the store.They have gone.I used can today: Can you go to work?
Can you do that? I want to go out to buy some milk, a banana and an apple.Can I use that for my salary? You are asking about whether you will be allowed to put the item to your own use. Yes, you can make that kind of money."
833,How Do I Get My Paycheck Through This?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Get My Paycheck Through This? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? 

I am going to look at a simple example, because it is easy to see, and in real life I find the answer can be found by looking at the word(s) in context.
What could be the meaning of this phrase: ""You have been served""? The obvious answer is that the person was served. That is correct, however there must be more. I could say ""The waiter served this person their meal"". However, the more important question is what does it mean to ""serve someone""? Is it just a verb, or is it an action with a consequence? The only meaning that I can see with such a word is one where a person or thing (a chair, a plate, money) is set upon the table, then a waiter or waitress takes it away, putting it out of the way, in the same way that someone is served their food.  A waiter is a human servant, who brings food to a table and removes the food after it has been eaten. But, what is ""served""? Why use the preposition when it does not mean ""set"" in this case, but means ""brought"".
Is it possible to define what ""serving"" is? What does ""to serve someone"" mean? Is there a meaning which is implied? I want to understand better the ""intents"" of my native language. If one of you could help me, I appreciate it!
Update:  I was not sure I should post this question as it may be off topic. To be honest, this may not be what I intended it to be. This is about a single word, not an aspect of grammar. However I have found a book from the late 1800's (The Story of English, by Thomas Wright) which addresses the subject of language and its history. In this book, he discusses the etymology of a few English words. There are some interesting points made in it which apply to this problem. He discusses ""Serve"" and notes that in Medieval English the verbs meaning ""To serve,"" and ""sate,"" ""eat,"" were pronounced exactly the other way around. The book contains a very interesting section on ""the history and the evolution of verbs"" which discusses words that have changed. It may have something to do with this issue, though that is not my conclusion. Anyway,"

I am trying something like this for my app's UI language translation feature:
<Label Text=""{x:Lang Key='MyApp.Labels.MyLabel'}"" />

and I would want to translate the Labels folder name into the app language. The problem is that I can't figure out if I should use a {x:'Key'} or just leave the Key blank or what...
Is this the best approach? How will it work when the application is installed in a different language? Does the {Key} need to be a full path string or a simple {Value} name? Thanks for any help.
Thanks
UPDATE: If you do a text search on Google for 'I Can Get Payed [blank]' you will get a lot of people who asked how to format their question. In the end they ended up using a 'code in' statement for their answer like 'This is my answer' (which is great!). I am still looking for a way to get this information from the text of an answer. I don't think it is possible to use the 'Key-Value approach' when you don;t know the language of the label. That is, if it isn't the default 'en', then you can;'t use {LanguageName}'... 
But maybe it would work just fine as is. Maybe.  If it does it may be too simple. But I could make it fancily formatted to display the right text for different languages. It could use some testing. So I'll continue to play with it. Thanks
FINAL UPDATE:  So, I decided to not use it and just write some code to determine the correct language string to assign to the UI element. Not a huge thing to do but now I need a place to put some unit tests. And I will put the information I have above in my comment. Here is a snippet:

So, there's nothing that I feel that, I have an issue with the fact that people can say that. ‹There„s a lot of people who I see, when they ask for a second opinion on whether they've written something and they feel it's good and I'll say it is and then, they'll ask the second reviewer, can you tell me what you think? Because they want a review on it as something that needs to be changed. I will then give them a grade, and it was an F!

There‹s just something weird about that that bothers me. Because I can‪t help but think what are the results going to look like?‬. . .

Can I do a Bank transfer to put additional money in my account because I am out of money?-
My intent to transfer money from one bank account to another is very simple.
I am transferring money because i am running out. This is a financial emergency. I cannot buy food. My family is starving. The only way for me to feed them is by putting additional cash in their accounts. -
It is not a very difficult phrase
But it is long
-My first instinct is that it should be short, simple and fast-paced. However it needs to be clear. It is clear to the reader - it conveys intent. So, it has got to stay. Can someone help me with an example. Please feel free to add some examples of longer phrases. Thanks in advance! :)
Thank You. :) 
Regards,
Shailesh
EDIT 1 :- My intent is to send a message of urgency to someone. Like a friend who is out-of-cash can ask me for the money to pay for groceries. If I don't have the funds to give him money then he cannot live. There is no other way to save him. No one should face such dire situations
In my example I say - Can i do Bank Transfers to Put more money into my Account because you are out? Is my sentence correct? Can some make sure? Thanks to anyone who can correct and edit it.  Please give me a clear example of a longer phrase to make it clear, like a short story or dialogue or something like that
Thanks in Advance!  :D  <3
The longer the phrase, the higher the word count. Hence, in order to have a shorter word-count (I think) we have to use shorter phrases? Or, are longer-words better when it comes to word length. Or is it all about the meaning? -Thanks for clearing all doubts!
P. S- I will be using this for an essay writing assignment. Hope I got this clear - I need clarification. :p
Here's an additional question - In a similar context as above, If you were to explain the concept to me, Would you use a long or short sentence? What's the difference between the longer or the shorter one"

842,How Do I Go Forth On Transferring Money Into My Account?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Go Forth On Transferring Money Into My Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,".

Answer:
The intent is to ask an external authority for help on the transfer to your account. ""To go forth on"" means ""to carry out"". So it means: ""How do I carry my funds from one account to another?"".
To be able to carry on something means to be strong enough to do it. Here we have this image: A man or woman is going forth to the grocery store to buy something with her debit card to feed herself and her family. She has not transferred or withdrawn the money before the trip to get the debit cards. If there are two or more persons, it may be a question on how to share or divide the food. Or it could be about the division of money or a family business. In all cases the person going to make the transaction is not yet sure of the outcome, but still plans to act. The person answering the question may not know where the funds are stored, may know the account where it can be found, or may just tell how it should be done.  
A question of this kind could also be phrased without the preposition: Is it possible to go on/forth from here to there?
Another example: Do you need to tell him/her the reason why you want to transfer the fund from the bank account in my name to my account?"
843,"I Don'T Understand How To Top Up My Account, Can You Please Explain The Process?","Considering this utterance: I Don'T Understand How To Top Up My Account, Can You Please Explain The Process? What is the intent that best describes it?","? What words should be changed to convey the sense more clearly? This may take a bit of practice, so you may need to try a few different phrases of various sentence structures.

I will go over this in the order you have provided. I agree with everything you stated, however, a clarification on the term “dynamic” is needed. Dynamic is a term you would use to define something that has the ‘power’ behind it to do something, something ’dynamized‘. It seems to me that we are not speaking of the correct definition of this word. ”I don't know how to top up my account, can you please explain the process.“ is what was said. In this case, there is no power behind this. The sentence implies that this individual doesn't understand the terms of service or how one uses his or her account. So, in fact, we cannot call this the phrase ″I Don't Know, How to Top up″, it is more akin to „I Understand, how Topup″. You have given us a hint, the individual is not understanding that the user has already created an account with a debit card or is asking if one is available, and if so, where he can create it. However, this does not fit the statement: ′I understand how topup′. This individual may be looking for a way to replenish an existing account balance."
844,I Don'T Understand The Money Transfer Process.,Considering this utterance: I Don'T Understand The Money Transfer Process. What is the intent that best describes it?,"? I'd say something along the lines of ""I can't understand the process."" But that's wrong. What does that expression of intent tell you about the speaker? Is she confused, or does she have an understanding of the money transfer process which leaves something to be desired? She has an attitude of disdain about how something is being done. I think that she is expressing her displeasure, and this could possibly be the case, but not with the use of a single word or phrase. In this instance there is a complex sentence (a compound noun phrase) that describes the situation. And she has a reason for her attitude toward it. It comes out through her choice of words and the complex construction of that phrase, which she chooses to do so. She is telling you, ""Don't get it wrong, because I will make you feel it."" Or in an extreme case she might use: ""It's not my money you're going to get from me.""

In my opinion, this is not a simple one (2 word) sentence that expresses an intent. That is, it has at least 2 words in it which describe her feelings and intent with respect to the whole thing.
What might this complex phrase be?
Money transfer. The words used make it a compound phrase with a meaning that has been set to represent this. There is an additional word, 'process', which describes a series of things, not just one. But I have never seen a two word phrase like this that simply says I don't see. 
So, in your example I would call the statement ""a complex compound, compound compound of compound words with an implied reason behind its construction."""

Intention-driven analysis and classification
In computer science, the use of intention-based techniques (such as intention recognition and analysis) to classify documents, web pages, spoken or written words, or other forms of computer input are commonly used.
Computer scientists use intent recognition to assist programmers in detecting errors in programs. Some languages, such as C, have built in support for it. These are called static analyzers. Intention analysis is more advanced than static analysis because its goal is not only the detection of a syntactic violation, but to find and categorize the intended behavior of programmers. Static analyzer implementations have been used for years by the developers of compilers, interpreters, and interpretted programs to check for common errors. Examples include the ""coding standard"" or coding guidelines. They have also been applied to natural-language documents and used to identify the main purpose of the document, whether it is an email, an article, some kind of marketing piece or report. For example, ""I Need to Transfer money into my account"" could be tagged as ""financial management"" because the user was most likely intending to ask how to deposit money in their bank account. This is important when a program (or website) receives natural language (a text, in this case) input. When using text to control another program, one must be careful to understand how the two are interacting. Otherwise, bugs can be introduced that are hard to detect when they're not in your code. So it's important to know what the author was trying to achieve. With intent analysis, we can see that the text was indeed intended to perform the action of transferring money to the account holder. Thus intent and purposeful communication can often be determined by intent-analysis systems. See also Natural language program analysis. 
There is a large body of literature on the subject. An important early reference was published by Robert L. Cook, John E. Hopcroft and John W. Tukey in 1974 (""An efficient algorithm for computing an axis-parallel rectilinear convex hull"") but, as the authors themselves note, this is still a hot topic in computer vision and graph theory. There are many references in the literature, starting with a survey paper by David G. Lowe (1988, Journal of Intelligent Robotics Research), and continuing"

A:
[1]. If it was written as [1] it would be a short phrase, not a complete statement. It's not an imperative. You need to say 'If it needs to' or 'Because' before making the statement about 'what to do'. And in your case, this would have to be 'I don't know what to tell you'."
848,Can I Add Funds To The Card Directly From My Bank Account?,Considering this utterance: Can I Add Funds To The Card Directly From My Bank Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A: Is this card transfer or payment of a loan? Or, is this transfer of funds to a specific bank account for immediate use? Is it for a one time transfer and then the funds are gone? In most cases, it is likely that a transfer can be made by using an online service that is connected to your banking account. If this is a card payment, the best way to add money to the card would be to use the online services that accept the payment card of your bank. A bank will have this information on their website. Most services will allow you to enter the bank information.
There are services also available that allow one to make transfers from another service such as your mobile phone or tablet for use on the GoPayCard service. One of the most popular services with over 2 million active cardholder accounts is PayPal. They allow transfers to be paid by the transfer service using their secure service or using the PayPal platform. The online transfer services can also be a great choice to transfer to GoFundMe. You can use an email address or phone number to link the two accounts and make the transfers. There are many other online payment companies that are available to help make online payments from one service to another online."

If you have been thinking of this question: how does transferring money into my account work?, then don't feel that there's anything strange in asking this particular kind of question for your understanding to become clearer or your doubts to be resolved.
You have got all information about this, which was the main point of creating this post for the sake of those, who, like you, have just begun to get to grips with what it means to transfer money. This post has the same point, as other posts on this site. It has to do with your transfer of money, that is, how to set about it and how not to make any mistakes and get into trouble in the process. You will be glad to find yourself with an opportunity to learn some tips on transferring money for free. There is no need for you to buy anything expensive or to consult anyone else, for that matter. We are going to reveal some useful tips to assist you in getting to know how money transfer works in this case. But if after doing all there is to your knowledge and your own experience, you are still unsure whether money is transferred from your bank account to the other or not, then you definitely should read this information carefully. To begin with:
There is some general information to tell you about how your money transferred is being taken from the bank or the lender. In particular, it is necessary to understand why you can transfer your funds out of your account. The following information will help to explain to you more about money transfers in your specific case:How does money moving in and money out work?
What money moves in to another account and what money comes out are completely distinct in their nature. Money coming out is always transferred for payment purposes. If your credit card expires, the money withdrawn from it must be transferred. As long as all bills are paid up to date, there will always be money in an account for its owner and a bank will not be obliged to take money back that you had transferred into some other account, or it will even refuse to carry out a withdrawal of the funds from an open account if it detects some suspicious transaction activity. How do people make money to move into their own accounts for further transfers then, and this is where the question 'How can a person get money moved into his account?' comes in. Of course, to ask such"

What's the question, again? It is not a question. If you read this sentence as an interrogative sentence, you will have a hard time. You will not be able to use your imagination and you may even confuse yourself. How do know where you started and how do you know you have arrived? How can you be certain what you understand?

A:
As for the meaning of the sentence and the grammar, I have no idea why someone wrote so strangely. I guess it is a mistake but then again there are people for whom every comma and every word is important enough that they will write nonsense just by inserting an unnecessary word into such a sentence. (This is actually pretty common on this website, but in case you are a beginner, it might also be that it was meant to be a joke.)
I would guess the most likely intention is “I want to transfer money from my other bank account into this account”, which is pretty direct and clear."

This was something I was wondering about myself as I have had trouble to understand how to transfer money from my Chase Bank acount, to my PayPal account, or my bank account. I don't know how that can be done. So I am really interested to know your answers to the question, this will make me understand better. Thank you so much, God bless you, and have a better day."

What about I can't do this? How? I need to do something? Are there other sentences that express the same idea of I Can't Do Something. I want to transfer funds..., but the sentence is incorrect and needs to be fixed.

This is a good question. It is one of those questions that many people don’t realize you can have a very big impact on the way the world works by just simply thinking about them. And there are many times that I think I should not ask questions, especially questions like the one you asked. That was such a great question, I actually thought for a bit about what was the best way to answer it, not realizing I had done so. But then I just went with the flow and said “Well that is probably a pretty good way of answering the question” and I guess that was it. The only problem is I am not exactly a world class essayist so I didn‘t really know what else I could add to it so when I read some comments on other questions I felt like ”Hey, that person did it all, here let me give you the full thing“. So the main thing I was hoping to get across is that you really didn't have to think about it much longer than that really. You just needed to have enough information to begin writing a decent sentence and then the rest is easy. This is just how it is with life. When you have all of the information you need you are ready to just start writing because all you do is write. Writing is how you learn all the time. Learning comes from the process of writing as you try to figure out what information is useful in order to write good sentences. Now you should be ready because there is more to writing than you thinking all about one question and writing sentences like that. A lot of time we think we need a lot information in the first few sentences when in fact the writing can really begin when we are already half way through the second sentence. For that reason I always try not to look at all questions when it comes to questions. Just ask some questions and the answers will tell you everything you needed. Sometimes I will just ask someone about how they like doing research and how their process works when writing essays. If they are willing to share that information they will have"
854,What Are The Steps I Follow To Transfer Money Into My Account?,Considering this utterance: What Are The Steps I Follow To Transfer Money Into My Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? How about, How long will a bank loan stay active in my bank account before it is closed due to inactivity?

The first two are easy to answer. A step to a task of a certain kind is a noun phrase in English. So your task is to name the first one. It’s a step in a direction, so the direction is what you name. And since the steps is plural, you say it‘s steps.
A step from an activity is also easy: it means to leave one activity and enter another activity. But the step can mean to enter the home or to go up a flight of stairs. Here ‘step” is just an adverb in the phrase steps of home. The word “step,“ used as an adjective, means †a short distance, as in, a short step. ‣ So the question is asking, „How long does a transfer take?„. That‹s not as easy as answering the second two questions. There are lots of different actions and processes that take place when transferring money into a checking, savings, or CD account. To find out how long a process lasts, and how many steps it takes, it will take some thinking. How are you going to describe in words what happens when a money transfer to your account takes place? And it has to be one long enough word or phrase to capture all the details. You are probably going have to write out a word list. For instance, to transfer $1,000 you might describe something like:
‚ÄúGo to the bank, get a check, fill it out, bring it back, write a deposit slip on the front, drop the slip in an envelope, put an extra stamp on, seal the envelope and mail it to yourself.‛
This one doesn‖t really work because it doesn't tell you how your deposit is going. If you had to use it you‡d have the $1000 and the check and a few extra things around but you wouldn‰t know how to get from that to what your next step is. Maybe, this one would work: ‚‮

855,How Can I Transfer Funds From My Bank To My Top Up Account?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Transfer Funds From My Bank To My Top Up Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

856,I Want To Top My Account By Using A Bank Transfer. How Would That Work?,Considering this utterance: I Want To Top My Account By Using A Bank Transfer. How Would That Work? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

You might be thinking, what are they talking about? What does one mean when saying one wants to top his account? This is a very common statement and it describes something like one wishes to get a certain amount of money from his bank account to be greater than the amount that is already in it. So one says that if he could top it by getting more money out than is in his current bank balance, then that would be the best thing that can happen to him or she. This means that one would have a great amount more than one currently has.
So, now that we have understood why one said that I want to Top my Account by using a Bank transfer. how would that work? It’s quite straight forward. It can be described like this, one can top or even double his or her bank transfer by doing so. You can get the money which is transferred in the account through one‘s debit card or credit card. The amount gets directly added to your current account. One can also use a bank wire transfer from one's bank in order to do so, which also involves the addition of the desired amount to his/her current one. Now, with this explanation, it becomes clearer to you why the person is saying that. We will see the next part in a bit!
One more question that needs to answered is that how to increase money in an account using Bank Transfers? The answer is simple! By using an ATM, you can access your account and withdraw a desired sum of cash. When using it at the ATM one has the advantage of a lower cost and speed of transfer and the transaction will not be subjected to the bank verification procedures. Also, the transfer can not take place without the knowledge of account holder! In the same way, people use online banking to transfer money to their bank accounts from bank to bank without any hassle!"

A. I don’t know the correct answer.
B. To know if I have money available from an account. If the answer is B, then you could have said:
C. How do I transfer money into my account? Is this correct? It seems a little strange because the meaning of the phrase is “to transfer” or ‘to move‘, not to transfer into an ’account“, correct?
D. This sounds like the name of a bank service. Is there a service like that? What does it do? If D, you need to say ”To transfer funds from my savings account to my checking account, is this right?„ or something like:.‚I want to withdraw $5 from the savings and transfer $10 to the checking, can they do this? Or ‚ I want money from a savings bank account and put it a checking bank and vice versa? „
E. You want a transfer of funds that is done from one account into another? You don't need any service or bank to do that, it is an automated process that happens when you do a transaction with your regular financial institution. It happens without any ‟service‟. 
If you have an idea or a feeling of what is meant, say it so we can see more clearly. We all have ideas of how we want things to sound like to us. The words we use to explain things can be helpful. For example, if you are thinking of ‹to withdraw› money, a ′withdrawal of money′ would be ‬a‹transfer of‬ money. A ‰transfer‴ from your Savings Account to your Checking Account would have to be an automatic process. When you make transactions through your checking-account, such as with a credit card or to a check, ″the system makes an arrangement with the person or the company, who sent you a debit or credit.″ (Websters Dictionary)
We can only guess. But that does not mean we know enough to not make any guesses. And if we don′t, there are a lot of other things we could do. Some questions, like this one, are easy to answer by using what most people would call common sense. Sometimes, to"

I would consider it a simple question and the answer is very obvious.
The question is:
Does the question contain information about the methods? or about accounts? 
My first thought is that it contains information abut methods. That it's a question about methods to add money into an account. So the correct answer should be ""methods can be used""
However, the next sentence says: ""You are allowed to use any kind of methods.""
How does one know to what kind the ""any kind"" apply? I assume some kind is specified but what is it the kind? Is it any method? Or any type of method or only particular types? But is any of them specified? And if it is not what are we looking for? It could be a very vague question which we can only guess at, like what's the time."

But, if there is something that isn't correct or something you don't understand, then the listener will understand the issue better when you say, ""I don’t think I have the right number of characters in my email, let me check that.""

Explain it in one sentence. For example, we are writing an essay but we don;t know how to start.
In this case, it would be ""My essay has a good introduction, but I am not sure on how I should continue the body of my essay."" Or, in the case of asking a question, ""...how do we ask a simple question and answer in an interview?""
Good luck. Have a super-day!
P.S. I love your profile pic. :)

And to your point, I would write the question in that way. If it were to come out as, 'How am I going to ask the interviewer to explain the concept,' I think that would work a little better. And of course, be sure it is a very simple concept. Otherwise you'll have too much work writing about it. Best of luck, again. Good-Bye! :-)

Thanks. It's been a while since I posted this and I thought I'd get some feedback, so I put it out there. Thanks! :D

Hello,
It is great to see"
863,How Can I Perform A Dual Money Transferring From One Account To Another?,Considering this utterance: How Can I Perform A Dual Money Transferring From One Account To Another? What is the intent that best describes it?,". The phrase is an example of an Idiom. How can we know if it's an adverb or an adjective?

A:
[1] If I was you, I wouldn't do such a thing.
B: What if I wasn't you? Then I would do it.  [2]If I were you [or, 'were you'] I'd be in that place right now. [3]I'll get to this, but first I think I'll take that over this. / I should get that, before I get [this over] [something else].
It's a modal phrase, as is [4] It's me or we are."
864,Can You Explain How To Transfer Money Into My  Account For Me?,Considering this utterance: Can You Explain How To Transfer Money Into My  Account For Me? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
Beware of using more than one word to describe a single idea...
This may be a sign that your communication is being misinterpreted or even misconstrued: ""Can You..."" ""How To..."" and ""In How...""... 
What would a more concise expression be? If not already stated, consider what you really want to convey, as well as the listener's ability to understand what your intent was - this can be as simple as ""I need a way to transfer money into my account"" or simply ""transfer money""
Here is a link to the Grammar and Punctuation Guide from Business Dictionary
https://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/phrase.html
""Can you explain how to do that?"" or  ""Explain how  to..."" and so on are very different. You would have to explain each of these phrases.
However, in common usage and colloquial speech, these can both be used together. For example, ""can you/explanation how/transfer"" and the meaning is essentially the same."
865,"I Need To Bank Account Transfer From Another Account Into This One, What Is The Easiest Way That Can Be Done, And What Information Do I Need?","Considering this utterance: I Need To Bank Account Transfer From Another Account Into This One, What Is The Easiest Way That Can Be Done, And What Information Do I Need? What is the intent that best describes it?","? The correct answer is I need to, as the phrase has a verb, I (need to).

The sentence, however, sounds like it is stating the conclusion of what is about to be said:
I need (to), what will be the easiest way to do this?
If I were to read I want or I'd like to or some other verb phrase, rather than a preposition of to with a noun phrase or pronoun attached, then the intended meaning may be more clear to you.
This verb use in speech is not common as it would be better expressed in different ways."
866,How Do I Transfer Money To My Account?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Transfer Money To My Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A) I want you to transfer money from my account to my bank account
B) When does the money transfer from one account in my family to the other?"
867,How Do I Send My Account Money Through Transfer?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Send My Account Money Through Transfer? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? What does an author who wrote this intent think the readers would do after reading it?

If the sentence had been about an object such as ""how do I send the account money with transfers"", then it would be an example of a verb phrase and an action phrase.
In this case, the word transfer refers to money, so it is a noun phrase, and the question is asking how to send money through the transfers, which is an adverbial phrase which modifies to the verb."
868,How Do I Do An International Transfer?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Do An International Transfer? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Is it a question about moving money from a U.S. bank account to a bank in another country or a statement about a financial transaction where you have to move money across borders?

What about this one, then? The two-word statement is a bit less clear, and its context has some implications. It would be best to know whether the person is speaking about an account that is in one of those countries:
A. Or about the account of a friend or relative that may or may not be in the other country.
B. But it could also be a comment about that friend's bank, which is located in a country different from the one in question. That could make it an expression of frustration with the friend about her own bank — but I would guess she would say ""How do I do an international transfer?"" not ""What is an inter­national transfer?"".
To be sure, this sentence has a subject (""you""), a verb (""do"") and a clear predicate (""an international""/""inter-national""). What the speaker wants to express may still be unclear. This sentence can also have an implication, though not necessarily one you would think of when you look at it from that direction. For instance, a common way to say that you want to buy a gift for a loved one is to tell someone that that person has something you like — perhaps not as something that your friend likes. If that's what this speaker means, the implied answer to this question would probably be ""how do you get it to my friend"" even though the ""do"" in this two word-statement refers to an action."
869,Are There Ways To Transfer Money Into My Account?,Considering this utterance: Are There Ways To Transfer Money Into My Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I want to make an order for some merchandise, so as I can pay for it using my bank account, which I have. Can I? If yes, how? Are there other options, or is this the only way of doing it? Is there a way for me to pay by cash? Can you please explain it to me in a little bit more detail? I need to order it in 2 or 3 days.
What kind of bank should I use, and what should it be? What should the minimum be for the transfer? How to transfer money into account? Will it work from a bank to an internet bank or vice versa? Please, help me! I don't know about any of these. How should one know this, if at all? Thanks in advance, very much! :)
Can I transfer cash from one bank's account to another? Which bank? Or if I had a friend's name in my account and it is a checking account that I want, can I just transfer to him directly? (This friend will be my guarantor, because I will buy and not sell the money, just put it on my checking and he will take the risk.)
Is there any other way to do it besides banks? A person can transfer directly to someone's online account using the same person's login and password on the bank, right? Do the banks have any security for this? It's not a big amount. It will just be about $150.00, about 2 weeks worth of rent. Is PayPal a good way? Any other ways or tips? :) Thanks!
Will it take a long time for a cheque to clear my name to the recipient? Because I've never done a transaction like this and I haven't read any instructions or guides yet. If it could be a problem in clearing or getting to my recipient, then I won't want it, unless it takes a lot of time. (I think I'll do the transaction on Monday.) I also don’t know how much it costs. Thanks. :) I'm not sure I made sense, but I tried to put some details on it. I hope they will help. You probably don've the time, I imagine, to explain and help all these questions, since it might take time to answer every one. So, the next time you answer"
870,I Want To Transfer From Accounts In Order To Top Up. What Are The Steps Necessary.,Considering this utterance: I Want To Transfer From Accounts In Order To Top Up. What Are The Steps Necessary. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
It is an expression that refers to the act of transferring money from the account of your current institution to your new institution.
This is usually a simple process as money is transferred automatically between accounts.  The only steps necessary are to make sure your accounts have the correct information to reflect your transfers, and to notify the institution where you've moved to inform them of the transfer."
871,How Does A Transfer Work?,Considering this utterance: How Does A Transfer Work? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? You might ask, ""What's the best way to describe this sentence?"". A few ways that I could word ""transfer"" in one word would be to use ""to"", ""of"", or ""from"". A couple ways I might use the word to explain transfer in two or three words would include: ""How to do a transfer"". Or ""Transfer of how to"".

Or even:
Transfer from/to how
The transfer can be from a person to an item, or even a company (if you want to be precise about it).
But in this case, there is no mention of a vehicle or other physical asset. It is only a verbal asset or skill which can also be learned.
However, in order to get the meaning of the sentence to make sense and understand the ""grammatical"" flow of this phrase, we have to know what it's talking about. A transfer is a process or way of doing something. This is done by transferring a skill, from person or people to a product, and that product is what you receive or have from the transfer. So, I'm not sure if you have a question in mind which will clarify your mind on what transfer here means."

873,I Want To Use Bank Transfer For Topping Up My Account. How Is It Handled?,Considering this utterance: I Want To Use Bank Transfer For Topping Up My Account. How Is It Handled? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? I suspect that many people in this country would say that I want to use bank transfer to top up my account. That would indicate a sense of urgency. I have something that’s due for me, my money, to be available to do what I wish to.

What is your intent to communicate to a bank teller?
I want them to put the money in the right bank account for the person using the bank in order that he/she may make a purchase or use of an account that will benefit from the transfer. A transfer of funds is an act of generosity and kindness. It is to extend a gift in a way that is intended to help. You may be making an attempt to say,
“Give me the best offer you have.” You can‘t be certain as to how it will be interpreted, so use caution. If you are not familiar with your banking procedures, it‛s wise to have the contact at the other end of the line explain to you what―s done when you transfer money. Some accounts allow for an immediate transfer, but you will need to wait some days before you can see the funds appear on your account in any other location. Others may have a delay of at least a few days. There are some circumstances where it is necessary to call your bank for your transaction to go through. Your bank may require a minimum payment to your chosen account and this could be done in an instant. They may also have an established fee for making the transaction. This may cost you something as part of being charged for that service. All of this depends on the situation. The service you‗re paying for has to offer some benefit to the account holder. For example, if you make an online purchase and are sent to an onerous collection center for having a debt, then you may end up losing something and that isn‚Äöt the kind of service that should be expected or desired. Banks and other financial institutions need some form of assurance that you won‖t abuse the service they sell. Many banks have customer complaint departments, who are supposed to keep you on top of any problems you might have with the services you use. Do not think that it must be a person from your branch that handles customer complaints. Customer services"

876,Is It Possible To Give A Second Card For This Account To My Daughter?,Considering this utterance: Is It Possible To Give A Second Card For This Account To My Daughter? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

Answer:
Is it possible to give a card for this account to my daughter
Explanation is that it is possible
To is an adverb phrase
It is a possibility
A second card
For the account
My daughter's
There are no restrictions on how many words are in a sentence so it can be: 
""It's possible  to have two cards on  this  account"" or
“It seems possible for me to  receive two  cards  on this
account""  or ""It sounds like it might
be possible""
or any other way you see fit, but in this case, it only has two
parts; there are two possible actions you can take, or verbs in
this case to do
Give and receive.   The two parts can even be the same verb if they can
take a direct object and a prepositional complement.
This is just an example. The important part is there is only two of
them, so the speaker doesn't need to worry what order they do; so
there is no need for an order, just like there being only  two verbs."
877,My Daughter Needs A Card. Can I Give Her One Of Mine That'S Linked To My Account?,Considering this utterance: My Daughter Needs A Card. Can I Give Her One Of Mine That'S Linked To My Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
There isn’t a lot of ambiguity about that statement. I think it‘s pretty clearly meant to be a request for a one-time favor, not a long-term commitment. 
The question I”m not so sure about is, what do you call it? It could be an IOU. In the United States, an unsecured promissory note for something like this would usually be called a “bill of exchange"". A card is a thing you give to a person for the purpose of having the person pay you back in some other way, with a promise to do so. A bill of lading is something similar in form but usually has a few more pages and is used in shipping. The terms ‘note' , 'bill', ’bill' of   'lading'   and  “ 'shipping document' are generally reserved in the US for documents used to pay debt. ‌"

879,"My Daughter Needs A Card, How Do I Add Her?","Considering this utterance: My Daughter Needs A Card, How Do I Add Her? What is the intent that best describes it?","that describe a person’s intent to do something. How do I add my daughter to my existing Facebook account? How is it a statement of intent? It means you intend to add your daughter ... \[to your\] Facebook. I can tell this from context because you used a question marker.

This utterances is an expression of need. The question *How, can I, add*... indicates that you need help with adding your young daughter. It is clear that the speaker needs the assistance of the hearer to accomplish the goal. *Can I*, an auxiliary verb, means that it is a possible way to complete the request. If I say *You can send it \[the email\], can't you?* it implies that I want to send the email, and I know you will send and receive email for work and personal uses. However, in the phrase, *My Daughter needs \[[a]{.ul} *card*, *\[[b]
{.}b*\]]*, you use the imperative verb *needs*. As an imperative, I believe this requires more than one word that is more likely the infinitive or verb that expresses the action. To complete what I just discussed, here is another example: *To complete \*, I will add her.* This one is also a request, but the verb is implied because it completes the sentence and is what most likely completes it. As you can see, using a single word verb can mean many things. We need to look back at our list of synonyms and use a verb with the appropriate meaning to express your intent. This is not only about adding someone to your friends list or posting a message to Facebook, it can be just about doing anything. Let's look at three of those verb's again and see their meaning. First, we looked at *add*, and its meaning, which was the addition of a number of things; or adding in a different way. In this case, your need could also be a need for a *new* or *different* relationship with your child. Second, let's take a look again at this one about *completing.* To see the meaning of this, you might want an example. For example *I want a \**\*friend* \* *to complete"

881,How Do I Top-Up Using Cash?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Top-Up Using Cash? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Does it mean:

The author is writing about how to top up the phone using cash
This is a list of top-up methods
In this list, the author ranks these three methods in order of popularity
There are two methods of topping up using prepaid: (1) buy vouchers, (2) load money onto a phone.
When a user top ups the SIM card, they must enter the number on the voucher they wish to use, and the amount they would like to spend
A top Up is where the top half of the handset will be attached to a special device called a topup card and inserted into a slot on a cell phone's phone
Topups are usually done from a local store or online retailer that will give you a voucher to give to someone to load onto the sim card of their phone at their convenience
It is easy to pay for topups, however, there are many services around the world which offer various options for topping
How to Get Cash for a Top Up, how do I get cash for my top
I use this topUp method for getting money from people
topUp is an online service and a network of stores that sell topo cards
To top your phone, you should find a store where you can buy the to Topup, or you may go to an ATM that lets you top it up
Pay to go top is to get a prepaid top or top credit for your SIM
You will go into the store and give your number to find out what you need
Once your purchase is made, a receipt will show your account balance
Then you will need to enter your amount you want to add and then top off your TopUp
If you don't top of your balance to $30, then you cannot use your top for the entire month. To top down, your first topOff to be $15
As long as it is in the $20, that top will stay on for an unlimited amount of time
So you must top before midnight each day to keep the free top on your sim
Another method to obtain top Off is from your carrier's website
With all the different options and different ways to do a TOP UP. You might have to choose, one method over another, depending how it works for you at that time. So what is your favourite way do you use Topups"
882,Can I Top Up With A Cheque?,Considering this utterance: Can I Top Up With A Cheque? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

What's the difference between an intent and a purpose. Which are easier to articulate.
Why can't you say ""I intend to do something"" to ""Why don't we do this?""
How do speakers use different words and grammatical structures to give their intent or purpose? 
When is it best to use a verb and when is using a noun better? Why? What are the reasons for using one versus the other? Does it depend on the subject matter. Or the person talking about the topic? If I were to go to my friend about what I need to buy a present, and we are talking hypotheticals, I'd use ""want"", but I'm also talking to a salesperson trying to get a quote for something I want.  Do you use more or different language and which is more common/prevalent? Are they just used in different contexts and for different reasons?"
883,Is It Possible To Top Up With Cash? If So How Do I Do It?,Considering this utterance: Is It Possible To Top Up With Cash? If So How Do I Do It? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I would have to say it was a statement that the speaker was surprised to learn what he had just said and wanted to make sure it could be understood properly.
In the context I believe the use of “can” in the above sentence meant that it wasn’t possible to simply top up with cash because the bank was shut, or there was no money in his account etc. So the question asked was more about the feasibility of making the payment than about what was actually happening, i.e. the answer was yes it is possible but I‘d need to use a bank transfer. 
Another example would be: ‘Can I pay you today?  I know I promised you last week.“. In this case ”Can [I] pay [you] today‬‪‫? is a question of asking whether you can make a small present to someone, which is always possible. If they›re not there, it has to be sent as an email, postcard, text or tweet."

If both, how can I tell one from another by looking only at the wording?
Are any of these three the best way to think about this in terms of determining if the speaker meant the word “is’ in the question (or in a sentence) to be the same in meaning as the ‘there is‘ used as an intensifier in expressions like ’I think„I don‟t think,‚ „there‡s a problem, ‚‪there isn‖t‬‹ any doubt, and so on?‛
Is ”there any option to top up a with cheque‏‰‌ (a single or double ※)‍ ? 
Any other options for thinking about it? For example, I know there is †something like the ʊənˈiɒtɪɡɨs‧iˈɑːʃ.ɛt of which there are some examples, like:  ‡›There‱isn′t any chance he might be‭‥able to find another‫way of making it work.‣ But it doesn‑t feel right to use that expression (for example), because that ‹ ʇʜʞʝʟ doesn ‮ ․‷‴‵t really seem like part of an ‴i˘ɐrˈtʌdʒʀʏˈʔʁ ɴˈpʰɹ ˅i※rʐɯˉʎʑʈʄ/ that could be used with an expression like. › …He was able to get a job in town‿‗ .

886,Need To Deposit A Cheque Into My Account,Considering this utterance: Need To Deposit A Cheque Into My Account What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I would suggest to be in line with most, if not all, English language phrases of a single or a few words.
This includes:
- Need
need
Need To
etc
The reason why is for a good reason. The need is a noun that is in need of to as an adjunct. There is no need for it. It is an adjective that needs a verb. Need is used for the need. I hope this makes sense!
Another example for this: You need to go see someone. This is one sentence. However, as you know, there may be times when we need the use of this phrase. For example, you have lost something and then you realize that you need money to buy another item. In this case, need may refer to a temporary state. That is, it is what you ""need to do"" now to get the situation back to normal."

The correct answer is option 3 (I'VE LOOKED). The reason this was not an option for question one was that it does not imply the use of language as described. I'm looking for option three, so I can use the word 'I've' in the same way as if I said to you I have looked.
It is similar to option 2 with the exception that there is no past participle 'to be'. It could be written: The cash deposit top up option exists, but it has not yet been found. In this case, if you did say that to somebody, they would immediately understand what you are saying, as it would mean they do not know what they are looking at, and therefor, looking. 
Another example: There's a red ball and a blue ball. The one is harder to find than the other. If you say you're looking, you should probably choose the blue one."
888,How Do I Top Up My Account With A Cash Payment?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Top Up My Account With A Cash Payment? What is the intent that best describes it?,", or does it describe a longer action?

I have a feeling that it would be something like:
'You may top up your account with a bank transfer.'
However, I'm not quite sure how this works.
For example, what would happen if someone went to an ATM and tried to top it up with the bank? Would the person receive a message saying that their account can't be topped up? Or would an error message appear? What if the account wasn't topped-up due to insufficient funds? Could the error be caught at the ATM machine, and then be conveyed to the consumer via a text message? I don't know about this last one, but I think I'll have to investigate it more. I suspect that the answer to this question lies in a technical solution, which would involve programming something for a given ATM platform, ATM bank and bank transaction. This would obviously involve some research on my part. The ATM would then have its own bank account, with which it can access it by means that I do not understand. In this case, the cash transaction would probably be routed through a third party payment provider (like PayPal), which could then route it back to another bank or ATM, for example. 
But then, if I wanted to make money, wouldn't I be better off doing freelance design or web development? But I would love to have my own business so I can work on a flexible schedule and work from anywhere. It just so happens that in this part of the world, it's possible to get a job as an illustrator, without a degree!

EDIT :
In response to jonathan's suggestion, my understanding of 'top' is simply, to move to a higher or upper position. And 'up' just means to go a place from a lower to higher place. So 'to top' a list means the same as 'go to number 1','move to last' or 'rise' in an ordered set, so to 'do top-ups' would mean the opposite of a 'bottom-down' action, i.e. a downward action. (I think this is right, at least I hope so)
So the idea is that you can top/do the top of something by placing it at number one in the list, by"

890,Where Do I Locate Topping Up With Cash.,Considering this utterance: Where Do I Locate Topping Up With Cash. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A
tendentious phrase.
(a) one expressing an attitude or opinion about the matter in hand. (b) a claim or statement that tends to prove a point. An author of history may assert his attitude towards the events he narrates; for instance, that 'all human events are caused by the free-will of man' is a statement of his own opinion. A statement like ""The only good is good and the only evil is evil"" is tendentious, because it claims to be an absolute assertion and has a tendency to persuade. It is called an example of polemical writing. [M.W. Turner - The Poetical Works of William Blake - 1844]
In the phrase, 'topping up with cash', the cash is 'top-ed up' and therefore has the same meaning as the 'tipping', in its sense of a financial transaction - the transaction is to the advantage of the receiver and disadvantage of him who has been obliged to make the payment. He would probably not be able to do so, except at the risk of losing his employment and being sent back to his native town or district. The word to 'pop' (to) has its origin in the practice of 'popping' a small coin into the mouth of an exhausted or sick soldier to buy a drink - a penny. This was known as 'pinking'.
This can also be explained by:
I'm sure you'll agree, when one has paid the money, he would want his money back. So he does not 'pay' back, in this sense. But he might use it, if he needs to, to pay someone else's back and then have it back at no risk. Which is what 'payment' means in a transaction. Also, one might have to wait a few days before being able the get the rest of their money from the person from whom they have been paid. One could then say that he has 'paid back' the extra money. And one could use this term to describe a similar situation, where a person is obliged in some other way to provide cash, but he or she is waiting a while to get it repaid."

Can You Explain This Sentence? The question asks for an explanation of the sentence expressed. This may sometimes be referred to as “grammar and usage”. In other places, it's simply called ‘gramm’.

A. I accept your deposit.
B. Deposit into my account.C. Your deposit into mine.D. In your account there is my deposit.(E. To deposit the money into your
Account).
(1) Which is best?(a) A is better because it conveys a clear sense of
concurrent activity between you and me. (e.g. ""I've accepted your offer and
will come to see you tomorrow."" B: ""Your offer has been accepted and I plan
to come and see it tomorrow"".
C: The two of you have already done this activity, so it is redundant
and would sound a little odd, as if you were just making a formal statement. If you use this statement ""Deposit
into my Account"", you might think about a situation in which a deposit
is going into several accounts. For example, an accountant might say ""the total
of all deposits to the company's accounts is $100,000"". (It was not ""into
my accounts, or my accounts"".)D: This is a passive statement, but not as
clear as ""accept your/my deposit"".E: Deponent is just saying a fact about his/her
own account and nothing more. It is not a question of yours.F. The sentence does not
mean anything. We do not know what kind of deposits are accepted nor into whose
accounts they are deposited.G. Since no one accepts deposits any more, there
are no deposits accepted.H. You can ask ""Where are you putting your deposits
now?"".
I. There is no way to tell which of the options is correct.J. When you deposit money, it belongs to someone else. So it
would be a strange statement for you to accept money from someone's account
without the consent of that person (that is, if the account belongs

894,Can I Top Up Using A Cheque?,Considering this utterance: Can I Top Up Using A Cheque? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

This is a question that is not so simple.
It all depends, from what I see, in my own opinion at least, of the
context in which it appears. And that context is,
I'm certain, very important. A good place to start looking, then, is
at the question, can I write a check? What do I want to convey to the bank by
this? A simple question? But it does not always go so
smoothly. Consider the following:
My wife and I took out a mortgage. I wrote a
check for $1,000. It cleared. The bank
reimbursed us $100. Then my wife cashed
$500 in checks, and we have $500 left. Can
she use this cheque to withdraw $600? Can anyone? The rules are different
in your bank than they are in mine, or mine are
different than yours, but we can all answer ""Yes"", so long as we
are talking about a transaction, not just the cheques themselves. In
fact, we could even have done the same thing with one
cheque, written it for any amount, cashing it, taking out our money, giving
it back to us, writing another chequethe same amount for our new transaction to top
up, with our own chechequess of same total amount in our pocket. So far, the only
difference, which we will discuss shortly, will be between the rules at
your own bank and mine or his, if he has one. But
now let us move to a real world bank. You can
withdraw money from a bank that you are not a customer of, by writing a checkeveryone is authorized to do it. Now, you can only withdraw the exact amount of your
bank account. For example, let's say you have

Can you top-up a credit card with a cheque

What is this expression describing? And how would you write this as an English phrase? Or, how does a native speaker say this?  
The phrase above is in regards to the ability of some banks to ""top-ups"" credit cards with cheques instead of charging the customer interest on the money.  The banks do this because they have a large inventory of low risk ""cheque"" chequebooks on hand and do not wish to lose money to high interest rates on deposits.
For this particular phrase, the answer is: ""Can You Fill-Out A Credit Card Form With Only One Hand is correct, but is a bit of a tongue twister. I'd say that ""can you"" is too verbose.

This particular phrasing may or may not have an actual use, and it's not the one that I would use because its not a very intuitive phrase."

As I have said in the past, intent is not as easy an art to master as it seems. I am reminded of a story of the great comedian George Carlin. There was an old lady in a nursing home. Her room and bed had no door and when she was in bed she always had a window open. Carline asked if she would like to close it. She said: “Oh I like the window just wide open, when I’m all alone.” Then after a few seconds she said, ” I can‘t believe you haven‚t come to visit me today. It is a good day for a walk, a nice little walk. So how about it?“
Carline said to the resident, that was a hard word, she asked, which word do you mean by ‘visit„ He asked her, do your friends drop in? She answered. „ No,‖ he said. He told her that is what they call ‚business‛.
She said ‖ business‟!‹ What‬ he replied. Oh. Well you see, if you are going to be alone in your room, your business is to walk around in circles and that‰™s how you do it, isn′™t it?"" This is how I see intent in speech. We can not control it when it comes to others, we only control for ourselves. However, I do have a saying which can help:
""If You Know What You Want Then How Can A Stranger Stop You?."" I say this not to judge others or to take away anyone‮™ right to make whatever choices they want to. But because I also believe that we know what we want. And if we do not, then we can be given the answer, in so many ways, whether they be our thoughts, emotions or actions. That is why we need to understand the concept of intent. Without that you will be like a person that tries to jump off of, off the edge of of an elevator, only to fall off.

A:
I think I'd say ""Pay my bill"" for ""I want to top up my account by cheque""
""Pay"" is a more abstract verb. It doesn't specify what you plan to make the payments with - but you've used it in a statement that makes it clear you want your money in exchange for providing the service (the top-up).
You can top it up online, of course, or by going into a branch and doing it there.
Note that while there are some verbs with this meaning, it's more often used for people. When used in this more personal sense, they often want someone to use a specific resource to do the action - and if there's no other way of doing that, then they want payment by some kind of money. Paying with a chequebook is much less personal than paying with the money you have in your bank account."

I just learned a new way to look at the sentence to solve this. I thought this would be easier, but I think it will help others who use an English major to think the same way. Let's start with the first thing:
...What locations can I top up with cash?
This is an interjection - this indicates that it's an exclamation, or is something that you would say to make a declaration - and it means that something is being stated, so that is a statement. The next two things are adjectives describing something else. It is stating that these locations (the locations) can be toped up. So, these things (locations, top it up, with...) can all be adjectivally predetained. That means, you can't just say 'the cat' - you must say ""I am going to go to my cat house."" You can change the ""to go"" to a different ""can"", but we are not changing anything here. You use the verb 'can' as in, ""Is she in pain?"" (can I go? - yes! Can she go?) ""Can you help?"" ""How do I do this?"" You are asking something of someone else - ""Will the cat help me?"" But, we already have the statement that the locations are going be topped up by the cash (which is what is in the brackets), so it is clear what the question is. And you are using the adjective 'locational', so the phrase 'top it' is now the subject of the clause - the person is going top them the location by topping up the funds. Then, 'with cash' follows the adjectival definition and then, the last sentence completes that definition. We have a sentence of two or more words which describes a person doing something, as well as something being done to him or something he or others can do. There is no 'what'.
We can break it down like so: 'What can X do' (X is not a name that represents who you have to use, it only refers to what you're doing, what location, etc.) The '"
899,"I Want To Top Up Using Cash, Where Can I Do That?","Considering this utterance: I Want To Top Up Using Cash, Where Can I Do That? What is the intent that best describes it?","? To be more precise, what is that intent and what does that express?

The context of the question is a cash dispenser that dispenses money into an IC card. That cash, however, is not enough to satisfy the bill, so the user will have to top up the card with additional cash.
That top-up is to be done via a card reader attached to any bank or cash machine, or even via the cashier or the dispensing machine itself if the customer wants to do so. In that case one may also be asked by the machine that he wishes to pay with an electronic or plastic card, that can be any card such as credit, debit or prepaid; the point is, one needs cash to add to the IC-card and that needs to go into a slot or an outlet of either the top or bottom of a banknote. So that's why the context asks if you can do that in a store, which could be a grocery store or a convenience store. I guess. 
In that sense, the meaning of: To top it up with money
is very clear in that context. But the fact remains that there is no exact equivalent in other contexts, as to understand what the OP is asking for and how it's being asked for. The question itself has the tag ""idioms"" and as one reads it one gets the idea that the asker is looking for a synonym. This is probably not true. It's just, in my opinion, due to lack of understanding that that tag is being used. Or just an ""idiom"" is one word while the original ""English"" word is two."
900,Is There A Way To Do Top Up With Cash Deposit,Considering this utterance: Is There A Way To Do Top Up With Cash Deposit What is the intent that best describes it?,". The answer is, yes. There is indeed a way to do top up with cash deposit.

This is one of the best places to make cash deposits in Singapore when looking to invest in forex or currency trading. When depositing money in your foreign currency account, it is recommended that depositors have a minimum amount, typically $10,000. Most of these top-up facilities also have ATM facilities so you can make deposits and withdrawals without using your debit card. If you are not a resident of Singapore, and are worried about the exchange rate risk of having too much fore x money, this could be the perfect solution for you. It is worth noting that top ups are sometimes capped by some banks and not all banks are accessible in all of their ATM. This usually means that you’ll need to have enough foreign cash in the account to cover these withdrawals. That‘s the good news, but it might lead to a situation where a client withdraws money from the top–up. Withdrawing from a top –up account is often not possible without first making the transaction in another currency (e.g. the client can only withdraw SGD$ and cannot use the funds to withdraw in his native currency from his local bank), or they can withdraw as much as he has left in that account. So, the other option available is that the customer can ask to be paid in cash, which will be sent to him as soon as the cash has cleared. Of course, a customer would also need an account at a local exchange traded fund (ETF) that holds fore X money and has a margin or topup of say, 5%. As for the risk factor, you may want to consider using this method to avoid any potential fluctuations in interest rates. But, as mentioned, top -ups are often subject to various restrictions such as not being able to use ATM withdrawals, or having to limit the size and rate of withdrawals that can be made. To prevent such instances, one may ask his bank to provide a foreign exchange account that is fully liquidated, meaning that he can deposit, withdraw and do whatever he wants with the fore exchange funds in it, with no restrictions. In the case where you have an interest-bearing foreign-exchange bank account such an approach can still not work. Even if you could top that up, interest"

This is a great way to get more exposure in your home business and it may even help to improve your business’s search engine rankings. The goal is to have the search results link to pages within your own web site. Then we will have a greater chance of having the information you want to offer to visitors on the first page of search engines. By having your web content all in one place, this means your search rank will be boosted for the keyphrase you choose. When you use this method, you can also choose to ‘piggy back‘ on other web sites by having them ’link“ to your pages. I will show you how to do this as well. We also will cover another method of building links. You should be aware, that when you buy links in this manner, the web master does not have much in control other than giving you the link and letting you keep their website as it is. These are what they have. They are ”freebies‟ and there is no need for you to pay them back. However, they want back links as they help the ranking of their site for keywords. This type of link has to be built on trust, and should go to a web area that is relevant to what you have to give. In other words, it has be a link that will benefit both you and the site being ″linked″. So be sure to choose wisely when using both methods. Both the paid link method as the freebie link building methods are discussed in other sections on this site and I am sure you know where to look. Now to answer the original question posed.

Here are more examples like this one:
The sentence I want to use here is ""The book is not written in English"".
Is the intended meaning of this sentence: the book in question is written by someone who knows English very well, or the English-speaking book?
If this book were not meant to convey the meaning the author intended, we can see immediately that the phrase not in the sentence conveys this message: there is something wrong with the text, and it would be incorrect to say: ""that text is neither written nor read in english"". In this case, a very similar alternative phrase could be: that book does not contain a single English sentence, for example. 
Another example is: I don't understand the language of that country. Here we should ask: is that language understood by the native speaker of English? or is it a language that is spoken by speakers of other languages, with English as an additional language?

If you ask any of my friends who have read ‘On A Plain’, they will all tell you the same; that it is a brilliant book. I have been asked many times why I chose such a difficult book to read, to which the simple answer is; I could have chosen almost any other of the novels that I own. However, I was drawn back to the author, whose name, by the way, is not the one that you will find in ’On a Plain'. He is known by his pen name; the actual name is Joseph Plunkett. His real name should be well familiar to any Irish person who may have studied in English Universities as the name of many of our most distinguished scholars are based in that part of Ireland. The point is, that his name and the reason why it was chosen were both of such great interest to me that they were what kept me reading. In fact, at first, the real reason I started the book was that one of his novels had been adapted to a film starring Daniel Day Lewis, which to my mind was a great pity that that had never been possible. This novel, in fact his first novel; ”On an Old Mill Pond”, was written in 1962. It was the first book that was published after the death of Thomas Merton; one must be born anew, after such loss. So, as I said, my first contact was with Plunckett, not his real surname. Anyway, back on course; this is Pluntett; his birth town is Limerick and was born in 1919. But he lived in America in the “great“ days, so I guess that he was about 19. He moved to New York with his wife in 1952 and in 1953 published his story; On An Old mill Pond. And then he moved on to write about a man who was in love with a woman who wanted to end the relationship. At this point, he decided to go to India and spent four years writing a novel about it. By 1960 he‘d published the second novel"
908,How Come I Can'T Find Anywhere To Load Using Cash,Considering this utterance: How Come I Can'T Find Anywhere To Load Using Cash What is the intent that best describes it?,"?
You might use a simple dictionary to help you figure this out.

For example, the entry for ""load"" in my dictionary is ""To transfer data or a piece of software into a computer for execution"".
It seems to me that the only meaning of this phrase that you really understand is to load cash and that does not seem to be a very common or useful meaning. 
How did you come to that conclusion? Have you thought about the other meanings of load that may be implied from the context?"
909,What Can I Pay With? Does Cash Work?,Considering this utterance: What Can I Pay With? Does Cash Work? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? I would venture that the meaning or intent was to ask ""What kind of item(s) can I pay for with cash, and what item or items will work?"" 
So, I have to believe that a possible phrase would be:

What can you pay with money?
or
  What items can be paid for in cash?"
910,How Do I Deposit Cash Into My Account?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Deposit Cash Into My Account? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? What do you think it means?

(a) To deposit cash into a bank account.
 An idiom that may be used with or without an ‘ing’ verb. It is always used as two or more words. The verb can be a transitive verb in a main clause, or a verb of speech, which usually does not have an object (e.g. the verb to do).
Example: I‘ve deposited the cash in this bank. “To deposit” is a „transitive“ verb meaning ‚to place a thing into another, esp. in order to prevent loss of or injury to it.‹ The ‹I› in the example is not a pronoun, it is one„s own name. See also ‛The cash I deposited …‛. (b) The deposit is into the bank‚s account, not into my account‮, so it doesn‟t make sense. In fact, you‪‬don‭‧  ‰t deposit the money into …‥ ―‖‡ ‗ your  bank‫ accountﬁ‌‽ (unless it is ‒ in—″‱your checking account or savings account)

911,Why Can'T I Top Up With A Cheque?,Considering this utterance: Why Can'T I Top Up With A Cheque? What is the intent that best describes it?,"in English? 

A:
In your example: 'I can't'.
The reason for this is because if you look up what can mean in the dictionary it states that:   'can not' and that means it has a negative connotation.
Whereas 'cannot' means that they are unable to do the action in question.  So, in your question, because you can is negative you could be able to is a way of saying that you are able, but it's not necessarily positive."
912,Can I Send A Cheque To Do My Top Ups?,Considering this utterance: Can I Send A Cheque To Do My Top Ups? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

C: You can send me a paper to top up, I just need to pay a bank to give me some money."
913,Can I Top Up My Account With A Cheque?,Considering this utterance: Can I Top Up My Account With A Cheque? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? (1)

Can I top-up my account with a cheque
This is most frequently used in a bank when customers deposit money in cash that cannot be processed at the bank and then have insufficient funds to cover their transaction.
What is meant
To add money that has been deposited to their account
When using this form of expression the customer is seeking to add a quantity of money. 
The question
Is this phrase correct? What other phrases can be used to ask this question?
My research
I have been able to find only one instance of this exact question in Google Books. It does state that the phrase is common, but does not list other expressions. Here is a sample search that I ran:
can + I + top + up + with + cheep +. + expression
A sample hit was as follow: ""Can you top up this card with cheques?,"" but with the query string ""cheep.""
Note, the above hits are only the first few pages of the search result, and so the number of pages searched may have changed the results. Also, these results are from a US-centric search. The search I have ran was for a UK search string. I am seeking for other UK-centric hits on the same issue. Google books did not return any results when I searched UK. (UK does have chequebook.)
Thanks for any assistance that can provide!

914,I Want To Do A Cash Top-Up,Considering this utterance: I Want To Do A Cash Top-Up What is the intent that best describes it?,"? I know I want to do a cash top-up. Is it possible to make a statement that conveys that same meaning as the above utterances? 
Examples:

""I want you to give me an update on your financial situation so I can give you an estimate of how much a service will cost.""
  ""The doctor says I'm fine, but the nurse says you're in trouble."""
915,"I Have A Cheque Here, Can I Use It To Top Off My Account?","Considering this utterance: I Have A Cheque Here, Can I Use It To Top Off My Account? What is the intent that best describes it?","?
A) To give someone money.
B) As a statement of fact: The cheque was there to give but the owner wanted it back. (a bit old fashioned now!)
C) Something to do with bank cheques and transactions. A short sentence describing the situation. It could be a story in itself to tell in a group. An example might be: “We were walking down the street and saw a man at the other end, waving his hands up and down in front of him, shouting ”I have a chequer here, can you use it to top up your account”“. There is no intention in this sentence to get money, but it describes the action of the man (waving his hand up in the air), and what the result will be (top up the account).
D) A statement that someone has something and can offer it. In most cases the offer would not be taken up. However there is a slight possibility that the person you are giving the chequ to might want to take the money and run. But what is important to you is your word that you have money that they can have. If they take it and don’t come back, you can say they stole it from you. So ‘I Have‘ (money) ’here‚ (someone can take and keep ) ‚it‛. This is not about being generous; it is about protecting your assets. You have no intentions of being paid back with interest but you want people to be aware of your money so there will not even be an offer made.‡
e) I think I should say that I am a very generous person. I never like to lose an opportunity of helping some one even if it costs me. That I had a lot of money in my account was a secret which I did not want my wife to know. We were out in public and I was walking home. Just when it was almost in sight, I heard a little cry: ""Oh, please sir, take some of my money"". I turned on my heels and said: 'That is my own money; you cannot have it', and walked away.§

916,I Need A Physical Card.,Considering this utterance: I Need A Physical Card. What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
I need a physical card. Or I need one card - that's ambiguous.
It's clear from context that he wants a specific, physical, paper card from that bank, though."
917,What Are The Fees For A Physical Card?,Considering this utterance: What Are The Fees For A Physical Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? A phrase is a unit of meaning which contains a subject and a verb.

You can't think of the meaning of a particular word without understanding its context. In this case, you need to understand the subject, that is, the nouns ""This"" and ""Is.""
For instance,
I am happy to see this day, This is my friend, She is going to be our teacher. All of these are statements about the state of someone's existence or feelings. To understand all of them, it is necessary for you to know who is being stated exists, who has the feelings, and who will be the object of those statements. You cannot understand any statement until you understand who the agent (actor) is and what the result (object) of his act is. This, too, is known as the ""who, what, when, where, why and how."" These are all parts of what is called the context of any utterances made by anyone. So, if you are interested in knowing about your own thoughts, ask yourself who and why. If you want to learn to speak more clearly, look into the who, then move on to what and then to how much. The ""what"" refers to the fact; the why tells you why you should do it. Once you know what you intend doing and for what reason, ""how"" can determine the best way you can go about doing it; and, finally, there may be a ""when"" that will tell you the optimum time to do a given thing. When you have these four ingredients in any given sentence, they will make the sentence into a well-rounded and well thought-out statement. For instance: I will meet with Mr. Brown in the lobby at 11 a.m. means I have agreed to meet Mr Brown at his place of business in a designated place and time. These four elements form a statement that has been made intentionally as much as anything else can be described as intentional. Knowing the four parts and applying them to a sentence allows you as well as others to determine a person's meaning or intent. That's how it's done. Now, as to ""What are the fees?""
The fees that are involved in your purchase of an American Express card, like any other credit card is to make an annual charge for the purchase privileges of using the card."
918,How Do I Get An Actual Card?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Get An Actual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? The first thing that comes to mind is: ""How to get an actual card?"" It suggests that the person asking the question has an issue with the status of their current card. They would like to do something else with their credit card to improve it. In our sample, this may be a better question to ask if the user is trying to purchase something online or if they want to use the card for a transaction.

How Do We Determine Which Card Is An ""Actual Card'
This is where we start defining how the system is going to make decisions about what the 'Actuall Card"" can be. We also need to think about how we are going the handle situations where two cards in two different systems appear equal when they are not. How do we determine if two given cards from two systems are actually the same?
The simplest way is to assume that two identical credit cards are the identical card since they both have the exact same number. If your system has a unique ID or number for each credit and if it is a one to one relationship for this ID then they can compare it to each other. This is simple and easy when the IDs are unique but what if you don't know the ID? Do this comparison by the serial number which is usually on the back of the credit/debit card in a serialized fashion. I don' think they will always be serial so you might have to go to the manufacturers website to determine the best way to handle this."

921,My Disposable Virtual Card Doesn'T Seem To Work,Considering this utterance: My Disposable Virtual Card Doesn'T Seem To Work What is the intent that best describes it?,"? It could be used when referring to one of the two following: 1. The card that is in your pocket. Or 2. Something electronic that you bought at the store, but is not working properly.

A) The first of these two examples could refer to a plastic or cardboard card such as an access pass, credit or debit card, loyalty card. B) To refer more specifically to something electronic in regards to the second example (that you purchased at a store) you would use the word ""card"" in the context of, as with (B)(2): ""My plastic card"" or ""I lost my plastic/electronic card.""
C) Or, you could use this phrase when you mean to convey, that the object in question is an electronic device you are going to discard soon. For example, if you were speaking about your smartphone or computer you can use, My electronic card doesn't seem to work. In that specific instance, this would have to be followed by a statement of what specifically is wrong. As in...

922,My Disposable Virtual Card Is Broken.,Considering this utterance: My Disposable Virtual Card Is Broken. What is the intent that best describes it?,"? And, why it is expressed in a specific way?
The correct answer is: “I need a new Virtual Machine card!” This phrase is spoken by someone who has lost a card and is seeking the next best replacement.
Now, let us consider this: I will need to have a Virtual Network Card. What do I need next? What does this say about the first utterances? Can there be a better way of talking about such a matter? I want a replacement for a broken Virtual NetCard. Can we make that into a single word and say NetworkCard? How would we say it?"
923,My Non-Physical Card Will Not Work,Considering this utterance: My Non-Physical Card Will Not Work What is the intent that best describes it?,"of English?

For example, a card-holder, when he is using a credit card, has a right to expect (if the credit contract is a valid contract of commerce) that his credit is valid, that he has not given away his bank account, or his property rights to someone else, and that there will be no fraudulent use of his card. He will also expect that the bank or financial institution will protect his money from losses due to theft and fraud.
A person who has just won a lottery, is, if he wins a large sum of money, legally entitled to that money. The lottery winner may also win the jackpot of life itself, but is unlikely to do so, in the absence of the lottery contract. If there are fraudulent uses of a winning ticket, then the winner can bring suit (under contract law) against the wrongdoer. Similarly, the seller of an item may require the buyer to return it (in this case, money). If the purchase is illegal, under fraud, for the reasons stated above, this does not void the entire contract with the sale of that card to you, just the use fraudulently to defraud the cardholder. This would also be true if the holder of credit cards is defrauded, say by some computer hacker. Fraud destroys the validity of all transactions involving the fraudster and the victim. It is not a contract violation, because a fraudulent contract, like any one else's contract that one wants to enforce, requires the existence of valid law to validate it. So fraud invalidates any valid contracts entered into by a person, including any contract in which the law permits fraud as an exception to the general rule of contract enforceability. A valid and enforceable contract requires a signed written, mutual agreement of intent expressed by the parties. That written agreement, expressed orally or otherwise, can then be reduced to writing and signed by all the participants, to become an enforce-able, legal agreement (a written contract). So, fraud is an act against someone who signs something to which another party is fraud-ulant. To the extent that law does permit this to happen, there is no valid or enforceble contract (there is none unless it is expressed, written and mutually signed)."
924,Why Did The Disposable Virtual Card Which I Used To Pay A Gym Subscription Get Denied?,Considering this utterance: Why Did The Disposable Virtual Card Which I Used To Pay A Gym Subscription Get Denied? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Is it, for example, a joke? Does it describe your attitude? Or is it an example of a thought about something or someone in your daily life?

The first step is to analyze the phrase into two parts: why and where is there and it? That sounds complicated. But you do it in less than two minutes when you take a moment to think about the question.
First is ""why"" the gym denied my payment method; second is where it happened. The two pieces may also be separated by a preposition and/or an adjective, ""Why?"" is a noun that modifies ""did.""
""Where?"" can be any word: location, place, time, location. ""Where did it happen?"" ""When?"" etc. In this case, the location is not as important as the context of the word ""it."" The context is what makes the meaning clear. I'll give you a few words for the next step. Let's start with:
I, I
You, you
He, she, it
We, us, we
They, them, they
This, this is how you analyze ""where it is"" and ""who I am""
In this first part you are looking for a single noun. You have to know what kind of noun it will be. It can have any number of definitions. This is just an exercise in logic. So the noun is an ""I"" in the subject, and the sentence is about me. Here are the kinds of I you may find: I, me, myself, my, mine, him, her, yourselves, ourselves, yourself, yours, his, hers, itself, themselves, oneself, your, theirs, its, ours, our, etc.)
Now what is this noun used for? Let me start over with ""you."" ""You"" is singular, not plural, so it may be used as an I noun like: ""He is your friend,"" but we want it to be a subject because I already know who he is. We are not saying ""he/she/it is you"" (plural). We know it's you! We don't use ""she"" unless we are referring to a specific person. That's why we use He, She, or It"
925,Why Is My Virtual Card Is Being Declined?,Considering this utterance: Why Is My Virtual Card Is Being Declined? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? I am leaning toward the two word: “Why is my virtual card rejected?”

I had a similar discussion with an American friend of mine yesterday. We were at a restaurant and a man came in and ordered a glass of red wine. They wanted to know what kind. He said Merlot because it was the most popular type but they didn’t want to sell him it. The waiter said:
“We only sell Bordeaux and we don‘t even have that in stock.„.
So my friend was like:‚Why are you not selling me red Mer…‹. It was a really good story. That was his conclusion!
Why do you have to talk about wine as if it‟s something that comes out of a bottle?
It was really funny and I think that‏, to me, is kind of what you are suggesting. To just talk ‘like‛ that is a different level of discourse. And you did it really well! You are such an intellectual‡, you know all about this and that! So, I just have one more for you‖, but it is not a two-word answer. (It is, however, my answer!) It is to tell our guests: We sell a lot of different beverages; we sell many beers and many different brands of wine and other drinks! That is the answer; don't get the wine out!‪

The word “what” can modify a verb phrase. In general, it can be added to any verb or gerund phrase, which means that it doesn’t matter if you say the noun or the verb is modified by a what. The what can act as an object, as well as modifying the subject. For instance, you can say: She has a good what for you. You can also say that you have a bad what with a friend of yours.

Here was the question:
How do you feel about this app? What are some things that you would like to see changed? If you use this as one of your disposable virtual cards what is it that doesn't work for you? My disposable Virtual card will not work. It is a simple question and it has two parts, one about ""feeling"" and one concerning ""app"".
What I thought the answer to the ""feelings"" portion should be: 
Feeling: It feels like it is targeted at people who do not like using the app. For me it was easy to say ""I would not use it because it does not suit me"". If asked differently I believe, I would have answered that I do like the idea of it, but I am not sure I could use an e-card without a real paper card. However, it looks like I can do a lot of that on Facebook (which I love) so, there is that. I like Facebook and I already have a digital card for it so why would I want to use the disposable card app as well?"

Why not? 
Is it that it is too short? I think so.   Can you give a better reason? Yes. If there are other reasons, let us know. (You don't have to state these reasons. We're looking for an answer. This is for a homework assignment. I'm looking at you, MSE moderators.)"

The listener knows what is being referred to or is implied.

This is a very good example. You would answer:
""B"". Because the person speaking is acknowledging the truth of the fact that they are experiencing a difficulty with the virtual card. This is true whether or not you already know about it. If you do not know, then the statement ""I have a virtual Card and my Card doesn't work"" is an affirmation of fact to the effect that there is actually a Card there, and your virtual one just does not work. It is very true that you know the Card will work in the future because you have one that works just fine in your real-world. Therefore, the assertion in this case is that the speaker's virtual ""Card"" cannot be read, so they would like you to fix it, which you will do once you receive it from them."

A:
I don't know if the question means that you need to ask the meaning of ""For Some reason"". In other words, does it mean that we can understand the reason why we don’t work? The question is too vague, I‘d like you to add more information about context.
For example, in this link you can see that the speaker of the sentence doesn‛t need an additional reason to not open the virtual card. He has already explained the reasons why he wouldn‚t do that. So what is your question about? Is there a specific reason? Maybe he doesn't want to open his virtual account for any reason. If that is so, then it can be that he won‌‍t open it because that reason doesn;t exist. 
However, if you add another detail and ask for the specific case the person doesn, you'll most likely find out that in fact ""some reason"" doesn's express the actual reason of not opening the account."

What is a good phrase that could be used to capture the same concept as ""What Do""
""What Should"" could work as well in the sense of what do you do to fix this situation?
The idea would be to get the best phrases to work in all situations as far as the most common situations are concerned and also those situations where they may be more common or less common.  
This question is for both native speakers and non native. If native doesn't exist just suggest an answer that would fit for a user of all languages. I am looking for general terms and not particular to English. A single term would work if it can be translated across other languages as I don't care for particular phrases that only work for English or a single other language. In order to make this a great question I want to include as much as possible for any language if they would want this to have the widest possible appeal. Thanks for the consideration all!"

A: It is not a trick, but it is possible to make it work. The trick is to use the new VPC service account, if you wish to get the same features as the other VMs.
I would suggest that you do not use either VMI. In fact, I would avoid the Virtual Server role altogether. Instead, consider an instance type that has an RDS instance and that can use Amazon's VPS service. These instance types are available in all AWS regions. There are some caveats regarding these instance sizes and some availability zone (AZs) as discussed in the link."

I will be thankful, since I am a student of communication.

A:
After I received my degree of ""Doctor of Communication"" I was assigned to teach the topic of 'Speech' with emphasis on how to communicate effectively as an individual or part of a group in any given environment. My teaching approach is to help students understand the 'what' is that makes a sentence or a communication a'successful' one. It is also to understand what makes it 'unsafe' or an ineffective communication and why. In my teaching I do not focus on specific languages, such as English because most communication does not take place through a language. Communication is an activity that takes place between two individuals and is a dynamic process that involves both the sender and receiver."

If your answer was “it‘s a statement of intent, not an action plan, or a goal,‖ then you have to change gears. You have a choice here: you can make this the beginning of your plan of action, you start planning your path, the things that you want to accomplish, so you become clear, specific, and committed in your intentions. Or you could take the path of least resistance, which would probably mean to let this statement be the end of this exercise and continue along the road of inaction.‭
You„ll start to recognize that as you read more and more‚ more often it will be this kind‪of statement‬of intention, an uttering of the truth that we‫believe deeply and hold on to very, very close to our hearts. We know that this‌is the way to solve this‏problem. That, „we feel it deep in our bones that that is what we must do. And so it becomes very important that the next time that statement is uttered that you respond in some way in order to affirm what this belief or intention is. So the question that comes next would be ‚how do I affirm this? What․action‡will I enact? How will‧I know‥that this has the ring of truth behind it?‮
This exercise has helped clarify how we might think about our attitudes about ourselves—things we feel in deep and fundamental ways. Here are a few other examples of attitudes and intent statements:

We're all aware that the new card-reversing policy that Google has implemented has made it quite a big problem in the world of Internet. In other words, if your card is lost you won't be able to retrieve it any longer. Google says that this happens because the card number is encoded on the magnetic strip. And if you don't know this, you can read Google's explanation for the policy. As you will see, this is what they call a change in policy and what Google calls the ""transition to end-to-end encryption"". You will also see that they make all of this in order to protect their customers. We're just going to explain to you how to make the best of your situation, and the first thing we will tell you is that is to contact the customer service of Google directly. There, they will answer to all your questions and help you to figure out what to do in your current situation. So, dont lose your mind because of the Google problem and just call up their customer care number to get all the help that you need. They will be more than willing to help to the fullest so you shouldn't worry at all. If you're one of those who have the problem of a lost card, do not worry because Google is not going anywhere. That's why they are making this big move because, as mentioned above, the main problem for them is their security. But it doesn't mean that if they lose their cards to be secure and if that's not true, then, what is it?
Well, it would be a security measure for all those cards that users keep on their phones or devices. This policy is just to ensure that there wont be any unauthorized transactions in Google services, such as Google Play, Play Store, Google+, Google Talk and so on. Now, when we say Google Plus this means, for example, that when you try to log into your Google+ account and you lose the access to it, in this case, because they don´t want to allow any further unauthorized access, to your account you cannot do anything any more in that account. Well, there are other things like that and they can also happen, but it all depends on how the lost"

What if you are looking for something you can give a short answer to? Then we can get this question sorted in about 10 seconds: What's the problem? You want to know why your virtual disposable card won't work? Here is your answer:

What's The Problem? : Why your disposable cards won'nt work
You know what you just asked, because you read the title - so it looks pretty simple, doesn't it?
Now, we could just look at the words - and we might find the answer in one - but what if we want more information? So we ask our brain to take the phrase apart - we start by looking at what we think is important: virtual, disposable, card - all three are singular (one) so we know we are dealing with individual elements. Next, why: it won;t... This might seem obvious, but it isn't. It means: the virtual card isn'n gonna work, the disposable one won';t work and the card one isn'; gonna - or maybe won"";t - work. If I could see any problems with the sentence now I'd be done - which means there is one word that could take a look - why is missing. So I need to find out which word the question was referring to. Is it the most important one? Which one is more important than the other two? Is the whole ""dispos"" a part of it and if it is, what part is it - is that a word or a group of words, or is there a whole word there with no parts? We would say: Why won""t it work or Why doesn' it (which is an incomplete sentence) - that means we don' care where the missing word is - it could be anywhere - the subject, complement, object, predicate or anything else.
I bet you see how this works. You could even ask yourself - ""Why is this the only word in the entire sentence that was missing from the previous sentence, and where is my missing one (or ones).""
But there's one more problem with this answer... it assumes - in this case - something in an ""it"" position; so let's move to ""its"" and look how we go with that. What about if ""is"" was the important word we looked for or did we"

b) Is this the sort of thing where one is trying to maximize a monetary value or benefit, or a more general or subjective benefit like happiness? What kind of information is available to help determine the value of different things you buy, like a car or house, for example. And, are there any ways to measure the subjective aspects of life? Can there be some sort? 
Thanks for any guidance, and I apologize for the general nature of the question. I think my question is somewhat vague, which is why it will be hard to find any useful examples or links.  I'm looking for a specific sort that I can find some helpful ideas or advice about. If that makes for more difficult question, let me know, I'll edit out the parts that seem out of line or don't really provide much useful content. Thanks"

There are a good few that fit this, but, for some reason, this didn't really catch my eye until you mentioned that this wasn't just an explanation, it was an example. I agree it could be the right answer, although I don't think it is, because a 'little, or no, explanation' just doesn't cut it.

This was also posted in the ""What"" thread, where ""a little... explanation"" was already on the list, so that's why the comment was downvoted. If you can understand, I'll post it here too:

3 - this answer is too vague. Please try to improve the title by summarizing the actual problem. The question asked for an ""utterance"" with the intended meaning, ""I used the ATM to get money out for holiday shopping"", and that is not explained here. Perhaps ""The problem I wanted help with was"" would be a better title?
You're absolutely right - and the reason given is that the asker had a vague description of their problem so it would have been a bit of work to figure out exactly what they wanted. So what do I put here in this place? Just ""This utterence has a certain feeling"" - like I said, a description and not an actual explanation - or do you want one as well? There's also the possibility that no answer at all will be given but that seems rather unlikely. And what if it's not the questioner who wants the help - what's the general answer? Or is it just not possible to know what a sentence expresses? And the OP, if they're not actually familiar with English, might not have a clue either. Is it a bad title to say that I want an answer for this one? Maybe they know the context, they just haven't mentioned it because it doesn;t matter in their question? It seems to be one of those questions that will only get a correct answer once you actually read the whole question and give it"
958,The Cash Withdrawal Exchange Rate Is Not Correct.,Considering this utterance: The Cash Withdrawal Exchange Rate Is Not Correct. What is the intent that best describes it?,"? [1] This uttering is not correct. This expression is incorrect. The speaker is making an utteration expressing her disagreement.

This utterement: We will not let the government raise interest rates on its citizens. Expressing the speaker's intent: I am telling you that no one, including the Federal Reserve, will raise any interest rate on us. That statement is what I call a declaration. An utterment. A verb. It is an assertion. I will call it an affirmative statement. Because it includes words such the words: we, the, let, any, interest, raise. All words that are a verb or part of a verbal phrase and are used to make a statement expressing the listener's belief. So, I believe that the writer will never raise his children from a low interest to a high interest. [2] That is my belief and you are hearing it. You are listening to it now. We are not going to let them raise the interest [3] rate. He is saying that they will NEVER raise it on anyone. They say that you can't pay with interest.. [4] He says that he will stand up and make this statement to you so that it is heard by everyone. In order to do this he is using a word such as: ""will."" A verbal form of the verb to say. To show that someone is going or going back. Someone is returning. But, what is meant by ""never"" in English? It means never. And that never is in the past tense. There is no need to add: it's not right now, nor in five years, or in a century. For this is already true. ""It's true"" as in this expression: It's a true that. Also, when we are talking in past time, we use the phrase: to never or have never which means ""has never"" or ""did not ever"" when talking about what we do or do not like. Or, have not done in our lives. Such as never eating pizza. Never taking drugs. Having never eaten chicken. Now, you see, that's the difference between ""it's"" and ""is."" ""Is"" means the same in all tenses. If it says it in any tense, it means it right away. What does it mean now? Or in twenty years"

To answer these questions, it is essential to recognize that an international money transfer may be a type of currency transaction, a kind of international exchange, and a foreign currency exchange (FX) transaction.
A currency transfer is among the most common form of a currency business. Currency business is an exchange among two or more nations, nations of different countries, currencies, etc. For instance, US dollars may change hands for Chinese renminbi with a transaction made between two countries. On the other side of the globe, the US dollar may turn into a trade in the Russian Ruble in an transaction between the two currencies (or between a couple nations).
This might be described as an FX transaction if the nation or company is involved that is based in a country other than the place where the trade takes location. This can be when a business in France changes into in US Dollars for any person in Brazil. In this situation, an additional transaction is required to complete the transaction: the exchange between US and French money. If the business that trades in dollars is located in Canada, then an inter-national money transaction will be required. An example of this is when US customers are able to send funds into the Canadian dollar by going to an online exchange. The funds are exchanged between American and Canadian money, thus the money is no longer located within the borders of America. Because it was exchanged, this would be regarded as FX business as there was a change in money while the change was made in borders. But, when you do a transfer to your bank account in Europe, you are making an overseas or international currency transformation. While this may also involve an currency change, what is being changed in one nation (the US) to another nation, in many cases it involves a money conversion. As such, that‘s why FX is a better way to think about international transfers that are made from one country to a different country, while ‘Money Transfers” is better applied to transfers made inside of your own nation"

The reason is simple, if you don't you are likely to get your messages muddled up, confused or misunderstood. This will happen more than enough if your words don’t come from you in the way you intend, or worse still if they don´t. That is why you need to be careful in how you communicate."

This is why you should always take a good hard look into the company you are buying from because if you don't do that then you may be missing out on your potential. I don’t care how many bad reviews you take into consideration before making a purchase. In fact I would go so far as to say that there is no company out there that is perfect and even when you find that perfect company then something somewhere along the way will go wrong and you will be unhappy with the experience or you can simply lose out and miss out. When you buy or sell anything you need to ensure that your company has something that separates it from the crowd and this is where the quality reviews come into play. They can tell you all the things you want to know about a company from their experience. The good side about it is that the customer service is something you also need so even if reviews don;t seem to be positive, if its the right company they will always respond and help you. If you do take some time and think about reviews as well as what you know, then they can really help your decision. You should look at your needs and what type of service you might require before buying or selling anything. Look at some company reviews and also look to see what the industry is like for that industry. This will help if the service that you have needs more improvement. Check what others are saying in the areas where your looking to buy and sell in and look up some forums that are related to that area. For example if I wanted to sell online, I could look in forums to find out more information about the current trends and the products that people are using now to go online. Once there, it would be a place that would have people that had similar interests and they would talk about all kinds of interesting things that have to do with online services. There could be some that were really happy and others that weren”t happy at all and these people would let you in on what they saw was going on out in this world. Take a look yourself and see if they are anything that interest you or if your interested in learning something new. Its important to take the time to review the website and learn about each and every aspect that they offer to their customers. Some have"

1.
It is a computer program that can be installed on a
handheld device for the purpose of transferring funds. It is
also commonly called a ""pay as you go"" (PAYG) card.2. A
small card that has been specially designed for use with an
ATM. The card has a magnetic stripe and a builtin, read-write
chip. This chip is usually read by inserting the card into a card
reader, usually at the ATM.3. An I.D. card used in the
process of payment at an electronic terminal.4. In the United
States, an I-95 or other federal identification card, that is used
for access to the interstate highway system.5. Also, used for
payments over a network such as the Internet.6. Used to provide a temporary
identification for someone who is not registered with a permanent
one (driver's license, credit card).7. a disposable credit
card or debit card for a mobile device.8. disposable prepaid
gift card with value, redeemable for specific goods or services
from a given vendor.9. I have read about the concept in an email from
a friend who got an American Express card which would be
useable on the internet. He said that the company would mail
the card to your address.10. ""What's the catch?""
I have also read in one of the comments about these:
They can only be used at ATM and at merchant sites for online
purchases. They can't be bought from an online merchant.11. You need not carry cash or any other form of
currency for everyday purchases or even for occasional purchases. There is this card available for us.12. the most commonly found
disposables that come under this head is ""Pay as You Go""
cards or the ""Chip"" which has the credit or
debit chip on it.13. These cards are not real card since
they are used online.14. Pay as go, prepaid,
prepaid gift, and cash card are all terms to denote
what is known as prepaid gift card or pre-purchase gift

966,I Would Like A Temporary Virtual Card,Considering this utterance: I Would Like A Temporary Virtual Card What is the intent that best describes it?,"? For example, is it a request for a temporary change of status of a physical card to temporary virtual?

The best way to answer this question is to apply the following principles:
1. The most important thing is always clarity - the best form is simply as clear as is possible to the listener.
2. Always make the most common sense interpretation - this is likely to be the one most people would have if they were to think about the situation. For some reason it seems natural in our world to assume that the temporary status is temporary, rather than just temporary. We can get into the habit of ignoring our natural instinct to do that and just make an assumption. However if we make a judgement in a different way we can be more likely that we won't make silly mistakes. (I know this sounds very vague, but I don't want to get too into it at the moment!).
3. Ask yourself why it would be better if you asked for an alternate interpretation rather that just asking for clarity? If you have an alternative interpretation then ask yourself, 'is it actually better to say that or does it sound more natural to me if I ask for the clarity?' In many ways just being clear is a bit more useful and it's better that it is clear. So, if it makes a difference to which answer people have - why does that matter to you? Is it important? Would it be nice if the answer was different? Why would it make sense for people to have that difference in their opinions? You will come to realise (if you hadn't already!) that a lot of the time you will find there is no good rational reason to make one choice or the other. There's really a good chance that you can make people do what you want just by telling them to. Sometimes you may need to convince someone to a particular interpretation to meet a desired goal, or you might convince them that an interpretation you don' want is actually the better one. That's fine and makes life interesting, just be aware of what your intentions are and what they do to people and you'll have a pretty full and interesting life!
4. Consider what the consequences of asking the question would mean to someone who was asked. Would asking that change anything? Does it? And if so could it change the outcome in the way you wanted it to? Could it even have changed it"
967,How Do The Disposable Cards Work?,Considering this utterance: How Do The Disposable Cards Work? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? I can see two possibilities: either the speaker wants to explain the method by which the cards work, or the listener has an idea of what the person is saying but does not understand it.

I see some possible grammatical errors in the sentences in your post such at the pronoun ""me."" It's probably better to use ""I"" than ""Me.""

Lance RobertsFeb 5 '12 at 21:32
Edit
The pronoun'me' can also be replaced with 'one' depending if you are speaking about a person or a thing. For example: 'The card will work for one person' versus 'I used a card to get my car started.'
If the sentence makes sense to you the way it is written, there should be no problems with it grammatically."
968,How Do I Use A Disposable Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Use A Disposable Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? I would probably think: This is a disposable virtual card.

In this sentence: Disadvantages of a paper record. I see a contrast between: The advantage of the electronic format and the disadvantage of handwritten entries. The advantages may be: Electronic files are more accessible and can be searched electronically. Hand-writing files require time to locate data and to decipher handwritten words and sentences. Electronic information is stored and retrieved by an electronic device. Paper information must be physically transferred and stored by hand. A paper-based record takes up much more space than an equivalent electronic document. How would you say this?
The disadvantage is expressed by: handwritten notes
or
handwriting is much faster to complete. (This implies an earlier point of time when they were written).
I am confused about the correct usage. 
Please help me with this. Thank you
Note I was given the example as an answer below. This example did not work for me. Maybe I am missing a word or word order?  I have a different definition in mind. Please help. Here is this definition of disadvantage. In this example you might say: ""This card is disadvantageous for use in business transactions.""  Here a business transaction is not mentioned in the above example of disadvantages (though I know a person can use the word transaction in this meaning).  If you are a lawyer I might be talking about: A disadvantage to the client is that he must come in person to a court house to have the court take a physical deposition from him and/or his lawyer. If that is what I mean then I think the advantage is: it saves him from coming to another place physically and it is fast. But I don't have an example. Is this a disadvantage? Or a benefit? It could be called a downside. It means having a negative effect or it could mean: It has disadvantages. Does this change meaning? What other uses can you think of? How about a ""benefit"" of not having this advantage? That might mean that it has a plus side. Do you need a verb for it? ""The advantage/disadvantage of"" is fine. There is no verb, right? Is it ""it is"" or ""is a""? I can't seem to think this one out. Can you? Thanks for reading. Sorry about that. My apologies"
969,Where'S The Best Place To Get A Disposable Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Where'S The Best Place To Get A Disposable Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,". The context is where the best place to get a disposable Virtual card can be bought.

For this, we may assume the answer is ""Where?"" (or ""Why?"" in a different context) followed by ""The best."" ""What is it that is best?"".
""To buy"" and ""to get"" are transitive verbs. ""To get something"" means to take it from somewhere; ""from somewhere"" implies some distance from here or to there. If the distance is not specified (as in the case of ""someplace""), then from what? ""A"" can stand in for that ""somewhere"".
I think it depends on your interpretation of the words ""a"" (plural) ""best"" ""place"", ""get"" as to what the context here really means. Here, to buy or get is implied by the ""at someplace"". In this context, ""where"" is a more generic word than ""the best"". ""At the"" or ""in"" in this case is also transmissive. So it is probably ""In Which place, do you want to go to? (Why?)"", which would then imply the phrase has the question word of why/purpose. But you may also be ""Is there a best (what) place in which to"" etc etc."
970,Can You Explain The Disposable Cards To Me?,Considering this utterance: Can You Explain The Disposable Cards To Me? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Is it a request for someone to tell me something, ask for help, or describe to me how something is done?

For example:
A: I want the disposable cards explained to.
B: You should explain the cards to her. (To her, the card is not disposable)
In B's sentence, how is my intent shown by this statement? I am requesting that someone (in this case, myself) explain a card to someone else. Does the use of ""you"" in this context reflect the first person singular pronoun, ""I"", or is it actually being used instead of the second person pronoun ""Them/you""?
If it does reflect ""my"" intent, would it be correct to say instead: 
C: The disposable deck of cards explain.   (This time, we see that it is ""them"" as the object to which I desire to explain)  Can a similar structure be used for a statement of intent? For example, I wish the ""new"" (and improved) software to be explained. Is such a ""desired explain-to"" correct?  Is the structure used here the same as in B when ""card"" is substituted in place of software? Or does this imply a different intent than I was looking for in C? Do we need a verb to express the idea of describing ""something"" to another person (as we do with ""explain"", as illustrated in A)?
Is this ""to be"" used correctly? If so, what does it mean, and what is its significance? Does it always mean that ""somebody"" will get something done for me, for example ""You are to call the doctor"" when it appears in a letter, etc.?
I am not an expert in English. I do not know if these questions are appropriate. So please, if you think they aren't, direct me to some place where I can find an answer. Thank you. :-)
PS: Is there such thing as ""the explainer"" who will do the work for another when the time comes? How do we address such persons as we meet them? ""Please explain to him"" instead sounds so cold. Do they understand we are asking them to do something for us? It is so difficult for those who haven't tried it before to understand our requests"

Choose the one word, phrase, or group of words that is closest to your intent. Choose a single word.

I am not concerned about being stolen or about the loss of my card. j. since a virtual cards are disposable, you're just wasting time if you worry about it getting damaged before a use. k. no one would want a physical card of any kind if they are not sure about keeping it safe and in one place. l. this is a very safe way to protect your credit card and protect yourself from any fraudulent use of it before it‚??s used. m. This card is safe because, should it get damaged/lost, it's very inexpensive to get a new one just like this one. n. using a card that cannot be traced/detected or stolen is one way of securing it from being used fraudulently. o.

My answer:
"" I would like "" to buy "" a disposable virtual credit card
OR
I would  like to  buy  a
disposal "" virtual
credit card.""
In other words: to express a desire or a preference, ""I Want"" should be followed by a verb in the plain form. In the example above, the verb is ""to buy""; the prepositions are ""for"" (to get) and ""with"" or ""at""; I have included the word ""dispose"":
What about the following: ""The only way to get a good night sleep is in a nice room, not in an uncomfortable place""
or
The best way is to take good care of yourself, but you need to eat, too.
Which form is correct? I want to... (or you want me to...)?
Thank you in advance!
Edit to add this clarification: the two sentences above are intended as examples of how "" I Would Like "" and the use of the infinitive verb ("" to do"", "" do"" etc.) are interchanged in speech. The second of these is a grammatical construction that is often used in conversation and in spoken English. A native speaker of any language will readily understand what is meant. My example sentence was designed to highlight this difference and show how it may cause confusion to someone learning English for the first time. 
As an aside, I'm not talking about ""Do"" but about infinitives in general...
To get the answer I asked a few native English speakers (all of whom grew up speaking American English), one of them said that he didn't think he would use either of those forms because they are a bit odd, while another said he thought it would be "" The best thing to...."".
Please bear in mind that I am not trying to say that either answer is right, just to point out that both answers were given in response to that sentence and that all native speakers would understand the question just as all would comprehend the second as well as the third sentences. Both sentences are grammatically correct. They are not ambiguous and are used frequently. I do appreciate any feedback though. Thanks. :)
PS I think I also understand ""do"" as meaning ""make"" rather than ""perform a certain action"".  Please correct"
976,Can You Explain Disposable Cards?,Considering this utterance: Can You Explain Disposable Cards? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

This post has been updated: see bottom, for a better way of writing the first sentence.
You’ll probably know the meaning if you think about it for 5 or 10 min and then decide. The sentence seems very simple, but its ambiguity and multiple interpretations are very useful for learning. Here are some of the most common meanings:
1. To explain the mechanism of a process that is complicated
2. Explain
3. Show the process of
4. Demonstrate
5. Prove
But there is a more important aspect that I want to highlight and explain. For example, here
I‘m reading a book titled “How To Create Disguise Cards: the Art of Disabling Security Systems”, by James C. Collins. He uses Dispose as the main theme and the word Disposition in the title. I was puzzled on how could I explain or give examples to people who haven‟t read his book, to make them understand the „disposal„ concept. This post is not only related to his text, because I‭ thought that it was really hard to explain how to ‚dispose‬ of things, so this is what I made and here. (I will explain more as I write more, or as people comment.)
It‚s not about how you can dispose of something, it is about the disposal of information (and other forms of communication): how can you dispose a communication that has an intent, meaning and importance behind it? You probably have seen people disposing some things like CDs (or even DVDs), so you know what he is talking about, what we call in Spanish ‟quitar la información de algo“ (›information removal‫).
If you want more examples (you will probably understand by reading my example), here are a few others: you‪ ‪disposing‮ of ‫an app‹ is to remove it from the phone, and ‖delete an email‼ is ‹to remove its content  (from the server)
The book says the following about what you need to do to dispose something properly: ‭ 1) Disposing is always reversible (if you did it correctly), but not always possible. It is like"

There are three possibilities: a) It means something like ""I need a virtual card for an experiment"" b) it could be a metaphor for ""a virtual life"", a life which is not real, or c) I need something for one time use to be used once.
In this context, option c is possible. A virtual one-on-one session with a therapist is likely not to happen very often, but I have had many one on one coaching sessions with the same person over the years. 
What's the best choice? I don't know. Perhaps all three are viable."
978,May I Get A Disposable Virtual Card As Well?,Considering this utterance: May I Get A Disposable Virtual Card As Well? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

What are the possible intents? Here are a couple:
1) You might want to know whether you can get a temporary credit card to get money to pay for a service you are planning to use. In this case the speaker is asking you whether she would qualify for this.
2) This question, by itself, does not have a direct intent. If there’s any ambiguity it can be inferred that the person is either asking if they can have credit for free or they might be asking for the opportunity to have the privilege offered to everyone else: a free disposable credit cards with free trials. 
If we go through an analysis of the phrase and the context, we may find out that it has a double meaning. For example, the listener might infer that she is being given the ability to buy something in the long run, but the immediate purpose is to be given a chance (or to make a test) to see if this offer is actually free."
979,Can I Get A Single Use Virtual Card,Considering this utterance: Can I Get A Single Use Virtual Card What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I think that the sentence conveys the following:
Can I acquire a single use virtual card. If so, what is it, and how does it work? If I want to understand more, then I need to know more.
The sentence could be reworded to be more direct, but it would convey the same meaning. For example,
Could I get a one time use card (or a token card) with one transaction."

My Answer:
“A disposable virtual card” – this is not a complete thought. But it has a purpose, a destination, and a goal. So this statement does represent, in a general sense, an intent or goal that could be pursued.
The key is to determine what you want, that you would like to do or have. To do that, you need to be clear what it would mean to you. Once you have, go for it!
What are your goals, your dreams, the things you’ve been dreaming about? If you do not know where to start, ask yourself these questions: What would it be like for me If I had all this? What Would It Mean? How Could I Do? The possibilities are endless."

The answers given to the student were:
1) to have fun, and
2) as the virtual gift of a greeting card.
It was noted that this is a “double negative”. This is an example of how to identify double negatives: In a double negative, there is no subject–a subject is necessary before the negative. Therefore, the first word must be changed and made positive; the other word may or may not, depending on the context. The answer of choice one was correct, but a more formal answer would be that it was expressing that idea that there would not be a negative subject and that the word ‘would’ was not necessary. Choice answer, two, is not correct. It does not accurately reflect the grammatical pattern, which may be paraphrased as follows: It can express fun in the presence of, or if there were a subject, it could be expressed that way."
983,What Is The Process Of Obtaining A Disposable Virtual Card,Considering this utterance: What Is The Process Of Obtaining A Disposable Virtual Card What is the intent that best describes it?,".

To answer that question requires a little knowledge of some history and a great deal of patience. A good way to explain what this process is all about is to describe it as we do when we have to tell someone else what the process of purchasing a car is in order to sell it to them. We will first explain the steps. Then we will walk through what our process looks like when it has to be performed. But first things first. To explain how to buy cars you have three very important questions to answer:
1.What kind of car are we purchasing?
2. How many car do I need in total? and
3. Is it important to find the cheapest price? or the best deal?. The three questions are the same for a virtual card. In our case we are buying a prepaid card because they are easy to use for the consumer while also having the ability to charge a fee to the card holder for certain functions. So we want to know what kind it is we plan to purchase, how many are needed and where we can find them the least expensive. It is this last question we cannot get out of. You cannot buy a card online, and you cannot find a price for online transactions either. That means that when buying these we get what we need, we pay what needs to paid and we find what's best for us. There are four major types of cards we deal with. They are Prepaid, Prepurchase Prepay, Postpay and Prepend. Each of them have different functions and different pricing plans. If you're going to get into the different types and functions of prepaid cards you should read a lot about them and how they work. Otherwise you will make more money and your customers will have a better experience than if you are not educated and they do not know that there's a difference. When you buy cards, you do need to have someone on the phone. Someone needs your credit information, or someone needs a photo ID and proof of residency. Some cards only take credit cards and some only allow cash deposits. This is a huge deal. I've written about this before here. For now we'll just cover this because it's pretty clear cut. Here is our list of different cards that you can buy. Prepayed Prepurchased Postpaid Prepended Prepared cards (credit or cash)"
984,What Does A Disposable Virtual Card Do?,Considering this utterance: What Does A Disposable Virtual Card Do? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? The two key questions to answer this are:

How do consumers interpret this phrase?
When presented with this statement, what do they think about it? Do they like it or do not like? Or are they neutral? Why? What does their experience of the statement tell us about its value or worth for their life? As such a question, this would be a useful guide to understand the market and consumer response for such value statements or phrases.
What is a disposable virtual card? How does this help with a virtual business solution? (see the post on disposable Virtual Business Cards)
Why is this a valuable service? Because it provides an immediate and inexpensive way for companies to get into the business of virtualizing cards. Why is that valuable? See the next post. Because the service is disposable it is much less expensive to the company providing the Virtual Cards than it would otherwise. In fact, when compared to a more durable card, it could be significantly less costly. It is as good a solution as any other solution. (For more details see the Disconnected Virtual card) Why do it well, or not, if you know what I mean? It helps if people understand why you do something; what makes your company stand apart? And, how they may benefit from that unique offering. A simple statement like ""We are a Virtual business cards provider"" is probably not what you want to communicate. However, a statement such as: ""Virtualizing your business card means having the ability to have your card available virtually"" makes sense to most people. This is because they would likely not understand how the actual technology works, but the benefit of having that ability would not escape them. The question that will help you in this is 'Why should customers care about a reusable VirtualBusinessCard or a DisconnectedVirtualBusiness card'.
The question to guide you is: Why should people care? That is, why should they be interested in what this means for your VirtualCard offering? A good place to start is with the value proposition of your service: what problem is it trying to solve for people? To make a long story short: Virtualizing businesscards is like having a real businesscard. How cool is to offer a way to put your real (or virtual) business in everyone's pocket. Now, of course, we know that this won't work for every"
985,When Can I Order A Disposable Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: When Can I Order A Disposable Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,":

The word ""order"" refers to the act of selecting a specific item to buy.
""Can"" and ""When"" are modal verbs. We use them when we are telling an
authoritative being (a shopkeeper, a teacher, or a parent) that
they can do something but we cannot yet tell you what. For example: ""Can
you please open the shop today?"" or ""I would like to speak to your mother
about her son's education.""
You can say, ""when I will have the money"", which means ""as soon as
possible"".
If you use ""can"" by itself with a gerund (which ends in -ing) like
this, you are simply saying what you can already do. You don't need to
add ""at any time"". ""You may go to London at any moment. If you want,
I can get there as soon at you do."" (If ""any"" instead of ""all""
follows the ""you"", this means a limited amount. In the previous

986,Is It Possible To Also Get A Disposable Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Is It Possible To Also Get A Disposable Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? A phrase that expresses a single meaning is considered a sentence.

A phrase composed of two or more words that collectively express a meaning separate from and distinct from that expressed by the words taken individually is often referred to as A compound sentence (also referred as: A complex sentence, a compound subject, compound object, A combination of words and phrases, and A dependent clause)
. An example of a dependent sentence is:
This phrase is not a verb phrase, it is a noun phrase. This is an adjective clause (a noun or noun clause followed by a prepositional phrase).
An important characteristic of the language in general, in comparison to many other languages is its rich and varied lexicon (vocabulary). The richness and variety of its vocabulary is illustrated by A vast spectrum of different words with multiple possible meanings. In addition, the richness of this variety is reflected in the various ways in which those words can be used to describe and define phenomena. Some nouns are noun-like adjectives, some adjectival noun forms, many noun derivatives, as well as various preterit noun and adjective forms. The vast variety and number of possible sentence structures can make English an ambiguous language. (English, like the great majority of other natural languages, has a high degree of flexibility of sentence structure). This means that one meaning may be expressed, or may also have a sense expressed in another way. For instance, an expression can have several different meanings or senses and be subject to various degrees of ambiguity. When the meaning intended is clear, but the exact words for expressing it could be in dispute, this is referred To wordplay. Wordplay occurs when two distinct meanings of word sequences occur simultaneously to the same listener. It is one of several linguistic phenomena where a person is able to understand a language, despite the fact that he or she does not understand the actual meaning of each word in a given sentence or phrase in that context. A person can understand something even when he is uncertain as to which word or sequence of them was actually expressed and understood, though he may have no way of expressing that understanding in ordinary conversation or writing, except in his head."
987,How Do I Obtain A Disposable Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Obtain A Disposable Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? What are the key words in it?

Answer :
1. It is an enquiry regarding the availability and method to obtain a disposable virtual card (VCD) from the bank/reseller as the case may be. The card would be used in a network to authenticate the user.
2. Keywords in the phrase are:
– Dispose. Obtaining the card for disposal only
3. In this phrase, the subject is singular. This means, this is a one time use of the VCD and not an instance of many times. Note: If using a VMS that supports multiple users, a virtual disposable card used by one user may not be useful to another user and it can become a security hazard. If an agent or application must know whether the virtual ID is for the same user or a different user, then the system should ask the question and the answer should be recorded."
988,How Would You Use A Disposable Card?,Considering this utterance: How Would You Use A Disposable Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? Would it be a question? How would you answer?

How would I do this? Or I am going to do that.
If someone asks how you want something done? Do you say I will make a note or I'll ask him/her for help (if you have no intention of asking)? 
It sounds like I'm asking for assistance or assistance from my friend. It's a little awkward but I don't know how else to phrase it."
989,"I Need A Disposable Virtual Card, How Do I Get One?","Considering this utterance: I Need A Disposable Virtual Card, How Do I Get One? What is the intent that best describes it?","? You might say: ""to buy/get a card"". You could also say ""for an online transaction"". The first one is probably most common, and this is because ""card"" is such a generic term and we all understand it. However, I would say the second, more specific, description is actually the ""correct"" one. The reason we say that the phrase is more correct is it describes what the person wants. They say, what are they asking of me - that is, ""For a transaction"" or ""Buy a virtual/online card for an account"". This, to me, is a far superior phrasing to saying, you want, a disposable virtual card. It's specific and it helps us understand what we are supposed to be building for them, or what their problem is. This is just an interesting concept that I found when doing copywriting for the first time."
990,How Do Disposable Cards Work?,Considering this utterance: How Do Disposable Cards Work? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The phrase itself is short and to the point, but the concept of the sentence is what makes the phrase worth considering. The concept is, “How do Dispose cards work?” What would cause someone to ask that question, is to be determined.
We are assuming, that the card in question is of a type that is used as currency and not, say a debit card. However for our example, we will assume that we are dealing with credit cards. As such, the purpose of this article is simply, how to answer the question and, why that phrase is a good one to begin with. If credit (or, debit, whatever the case may be) cards are what our question refers to, then it is an excellent question to frame. Why? Because a card of that type will most likely have a magnetic strip on the back to hold the information that will be read to authorize payments. That magnetic stripe will hold information such as the amount that can be spent and a pin if the owner has to use a PIN, to enter into it. It will likely include the expiration date of when the pin expires. To use this information, a person swipes the credit card through a reader that reads the magnetic card stripe and compares what is read with the PIN (if a chip is not implemented on that card, or the reader is able to read the chip). In that way, you can see that your transaction is completed. When that swiped card is finished and discarded or when it returns to its owner, in whatever way the holder returns the money to a store, at that point in time, all the data that was read from the swirled magnetic data are gone, forever, so to speak. They have gone through the transaction and are no longer available to you or to anyone who might have gained access to where it was placed to process the payment. Once that payment has been made, it has left the store where you placed it in one of two ways. One of them is that you are allowed to leave the shop and the other is someone else does, for example the parking lot attendant. In both of those cases the magnetized piece of aluminum that contains the details about the purchase has gone from in close proximity to that transaction to someone’s car to an employee bag to something else, perhaps the trash. At any one single point"
991,Is There A Disposable Virtual Card I Can Order?,Considering this utterance: Is There A Disposable Virtual Card I Can Order? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A. To give a disposable, virtual credit card, as well as, a way to pay by phone with one’s phone number. B. A virtual card that one could use instead of the real card. C. Ordering of virtual cards on a website so we can be billed later. D. All of A, B, and C
(A) A B D E F
B) C D
Answer: D B C A
Choice: A) This answer choice is NOT the correct answer:
The phrase “this utterances meaning” is a grammatical concept, one that is part of a language and one which can change as the language changes. For example, ” I can buy that“, is different from ‘I can order that.‘
This is not a question of grammar.
Answers from other questions, are also not ’good‰. An answer can mean more than one thing and an answer, that sounds right on its own, but is wrong on another occasion, can not be called a definition."
992,Where Can I Get A Disposable Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Where Can I Get A Disposable Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,", a statement?

This is a difficult task, and requires a good deal of skill and judgment. However, there is an easy way to get started.
If You Need To Ask a Question, Ask!
That is, if you are not sure how to phrase your question, just ask! If your intention is to find information to help you make a decision, do it. If you want to ask a question about a product or service, then ask in a forum that provides such products and services, or at an online discussion forum. You will get immediate responses. Or if your request is very specific, you can even post it anonymously as an email. But be sure to check with your local store about the policies surrounding the use of these facilities. There are different rules that apply in different parts of the country. Also, it can be a great way of learning the business. After all, most companies use these forums to post information on their business and products, so you might learn a lot about them that way. Asking in forums can also provide you a means of keeping track of what your competitors are doing, which is helpful when it comes to business planning. In addition to the forums, many business directories also list their own private discussion groups. Many of them even allow you to sign up as one of many ‘guest’ users without paying the fee. A discussion can sometimes be more helpful than a listing in the online business directory."
993,Will I Be Able To Get A Disposable Virtual Card As Well?,Considering this utterance: Will I Be Able To Get A Disposable Virtual Card As Well? What is the intent that best describes it?,"that is expressed in a simple manner?

A. The intent of this sentence could be described as:
It is likely that you will be able to get a disposable virtual card.
B. There is a high probability that the sentence will contain a verb of ability. If no verb is included in this simple phrase, then the most likely option is: “the intent.” However, the verb ‘be’ is more appropriate. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that this would be the preferred phrasal version. This example is an instance of verb inversion, where the object comes first in the simple present indicative form. It is also common to use this verb placement because it can be difficult to determine the intended grammatical form of the phrase if the subject comes before the ’of‘ clause. Verb inversions are sometimes used in academic work to make it difficult for a reader to identify the grammatically correct form to be used. In this case, a different verb order would make the form easier to interpret. We can also assume the second sentence is not the correct grammar. Another reason for using verb to place the of may be to avoid the ambiguity of meaning if it were a preposition instead of a conjunction. A. ”It‟s likely you „won“t be ‛able‖ to ‚get‚ a ‹dispos‰ble‛ ‟virtual› card‡. B. That ‖you„ll― †‪‹get a‏‬ disposable ‪virtual card is ‍ ‥ ․    likely‱‒.C.

994,Hello! I Need To Order A Disposable Virtual Card. Where Can I Do That At?,Considering this utterance: Hello! I Need To Order A Disposable Virtual Card. Where Can I Do That At? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

For instance:
I need to order a disposable virtual card. How can I do that? / How do I order such a thing?  
In this case, it would be something like:  I need a card that I can order online and discard.  This would describe an individual or an organisation that offers such kind of services and products.
Or: I want a virtual wallet that can be used over the internet in any browser, and is disposable. It's like a prepaid card, so I will know the exact amount of the card before I use it and I won't have to carry cash anymore."
995,Where Do I Request A Disposable Virtual Card?,Considering this utterance: Where Do I Request A Disposable Virtual Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
It can be described in several ways: 
As a request for a disposable/temporary card. (e.g. a temporary password).
To request a replacement for the original card (i.e., one the owner has lost)."
996,"I Would Like To Exchange Currencies, But Is There An Extra Charge To Do So?","Considering this utterance: I Would Like To Exchange Currencies, But Is There An Extra Charge To Do So? What is the intent that best describes it?","?

The answer to this question is:
Exchange currencies: The act of exchanging one currency for another currency at a currency exchange desk.
I would like to exchange currencies - the act is completed: the speaker has done the exchange. The intent of doing this is expressed in the rest of the sentence with the verb exchange: you need to understand the other side of this currency transaction; that you want to receive an equivalent amount of currency on the counter of a bank or a store. 
In the case of your question there is an extra charge - to be exact, an additional service charge. You will be charged an addition fee, the equivalent of $7, for this service at the bank. If you had done this transaction at another bank, it most likely would not have cost you anything extra (as it would at this bank).
So, in short: it is not correct."
997,Does It Cost Anything For Exchanges?,Considering this utterance: Does It Cost Anything For Exchanges? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? In addition, is any of the terms used or phrasing that is used by the statement ambiguous? What meaning is intended, or does this statement simply lack a meaning? If the answer is: “This statement does not have any meaning.” then the meaning of this question is to determine if there is another way, in addition to the one that was given, this phrase might be made sense of.

“If there are no gods, what do you think would happen when an old man died? We would be free to be as kind as we want without fear of any punishment. There would still be a God because people would simply think of God as what would make it fair. But if God were not real, then it would not matter at all. We might as well do what we wanted since there would no one else to control us, punish us or reward us. So, when we die, we simply stop. This is not a new thought. A lot of great minds have thought this way before. The problem has been that all of them died before they got a chance to tell us about it. ”
(http://www.godtube.com/watch/151748-the-big-bang-on-god-is-a-lie-by-david-s)
So, here you can see that there could be several ways that we can interpret the phrase ‘if God is a lie’. However, the interpretation of it depends on how we understand the word ’God‘. For example, if „God is just some random guy„, it is hard to see why this would cost anything. In contrast, suppose that ‚God exists‌‚, but is an entirely different being than the person in the sky‟. Well, you know what? It costs something to not believe in this being. As a matter of fact, as this guy says, ‒‰ it might mean a hell of a lot depending on your perspective and your moral and ethical belief system. Of course, there really could only be one conclusion when someone says ‪‹‬if there  ‪ is no god . No one ′‮› really has the right to think they know,�"

999,Does It Cost To Exchange Currencies?,Considering this utterance: Does It Cost To Exchange Currencies? What is the intent that best describes it?,": a: to exchange the currency for another currency as in; “the value of the pound in dollars is dropping” ‑ b: the price of a currency’s exchange as expressed in the buying price for other currencies as stated in: ‘The exchange rate of Japanese Yen will be at $1..‘ or ” The exchange value is $. … the exchange exchange of currencies between the U S dollar or British Pound. …. It is common use but what does it mean? What does exchange mean as used in this context? The word exchange means ’ exchange ‚ exchange …

The word to describe the idea of „exchange“ is ‟ exchange‟, and you would write it like this:
„ The value [of the Pound] in [dollars] is [declining].‖
This means you are saying that the value (that is, cost) of your pound is declining in relation to dollars. In fact, if you were to buy $2 worth of goods, the $3 you paid would be worth less to you than the dollar you got back.
That is not a ″value change ‹ exchange – the cost of something has decreased, therefore the same thing will cost less than we were paying previously.‏″
A cost is a price. Exchange is different. For instance, I can purchase an item at cost price, even if the product is expensive. So I have not exchanged anything – my cost has not increased. But if I were selling something, then my costs would increase due to the added value that is added to. Therefore I had to increase my price and sell it to make a profit – exchange in fact. That is my point here. The term can be a little confusing. If I say I paid 50p for my new pair of trainers – it might mean that I got them for £50 – but the retailer only takes 50% of that, so I actually only paid £25 for them. I only exchange £30 for trainers. It means the actual cost for the purchase was £35. However, this is just an example, as it is easy to confuse the term in real life and there can."

This question has three components to it: the meaning of the word(s) used and the grammatical structure of which they’re a part. It has also been referred to as sentence analysis, sentence parsing and word order analysis.
The components of question one are the words that make up each phrase or sentence. If the first part of a sentence makes sense in isolation, but is not clear when a second part or parts are added, then a problem has been identified in the structure(ies) of that section in question. A simple example of this could be that a noun phrase is followed by an adjective phrase without a verb to complete it into a complete sentence: 
I was charged on the charge of using a free card. – not a good example because the adjective would be the part that the problem lies in."

1004,Will I Get Charged For Topping Off My Card?,Considering this utterance: Will I Get Charged For Topping Off My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? The word 'Charge' is used with intent for the purpose of 'topping off'. The 'Topping-Off' of the card represents 'finishing off' one's bill, so that it will reach a specific total.

What is 'top- off', 'fill-up', or 'up- charge'? To 'Top-off' the gas, is to add some fuel to the tank, to 'Fill- up' a tank with liquid. If someone 'ups- Charges' someone, that person has the ability of charging some extra amount of money on an account. A 'charge-back' would have the same effect. That is when someone charges back a portion of what has already been charged. You can also refer to a person's 'over-charge' if their account has been exceeded. They are being charged in excess of a reasonable amount. This would be considered a 'bill-shock'.
   * **What will happen if 'the account is topped off'?** What will be the outcome if someone puts in their full amount on a credit card, and the account then reaches full capacity? Would this be referred to as 'filling up'?
* **Is someone in credit?** Credit is a type of debt that is owed on the balance of outstanding bills and debts. When someone is in debt there is always a potential risk that you will not be able to pay your debts, or you might even go bankrupt. The more debt you owe, the greater the risk will this become. It is important to make sure that your debt is not too high.

  You may have seen credit cards with the terms: 'The limit on your credit is $______ per month'. This means that if you were to go over the permitted limit you would either start getting charged interest, you may be 'charged' for over-using your card. Also, your current balance would then 'go beyond the credit limit of $_____'. That means the amount you can still spend would now be limited and you could receive negative balances on all your purchases at stores. In this case, a charge might be placed on this balance for 'going beyond your limit'. Also known as an 'unauthorized transaction', this can lead to additional fees. So it is best to be careful how much debt people have."
1005,Are There Charges For Topping Up Us Cards?,Considering this utterance: Are There Charges For Topping Up Us Cards? What is the intent that best describes it?,"(sentences)?

A:
*""The intent is expressed by the following utterances..."" is grammatically incorrect.
You can say ""Are there charges for topping up a US debit card?"" which makes sense and doesn't sound weird. (Unless, of course, you're talking about ""topping up"" a credit card, or a debit/credit card in which case you probably shouldn't have said it.)
If you want to talk about the meaning of the question, I would recommend ""the intent of..."" or ""what is being sought by...."" and then say, ""...that was the purpose of that question"".
It is not really important to know the grammatical rules of a question to understand the intention of it. The grammars of English are not as consistent as they are for other languages, and there are lots of things in the language that don't actually require a gramatical rule to be understood. A rule may even have exceptions that contradict it, as in ""The door was opened"" (but no-one would use it that way).
So if you say something is an example of ""grammatical incorrectness"" it is because it violates some rule, whereas when you talk of someone or something's meaning you are talking in terms of what you think the person or thing is trying to communicate. You are describing the speaker's intentions as you understand them, rather than the strict correctness or incorrectnesses of their language."
1006,Are There Fees For Top Ups?,Considering this utterance: Are There Fees For Top Ups? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? To me, the only interpretation for the phrase is fees; fees to receive a top up.

The word ""topped"" is a noun, so, this question applies to the entire question. The noun ""fee"" cannot stand alone as it has no subject, which means that this phrase would not have to mean fees for receiving a service and then paying for it. This question is specifically asking about fees related to top ups, not fees in general."

I am looking to get a better understanding of some basic grammatical terms - specifically with the use of a preposition. I am referring to the phrase (1.1) in the following sentence:
1- Is there an additional charge for topping up using a European card?
2- What does the prepositional phrase: To topping  mean? What part (part of speech) does is play? Is it:  - part of the verb or the object? 
3- In case no additional cost (additional cost is an extra cost for a service/product/event - e.g. an admission fee, a parking fee and so on)?  Is this additional? If yes, how can this be a negative word? Would one use an adverb or adjective in this case (e. g. “no additional”)? Or should one say this negative is a noun? I have always heard the adjective form - additional being used here. In fact, when looking at the Oxford English dictionary entry of ‘addition’, it says: ” ’a thing in addition which you buy to‘“.
4- Can I ask a question? The use a as the first word in a sentence is not considered grammatically correct. Can someone tell me the reasons for this? In what circumstances is it used. For example: can you use „To be able„? Or, should it be ‚Tobe‚? Can this kind of construction also be used with a verb? Please help me as these words have a very special role in some sentences and are not to be confused with other words like ""to be"" (in the sense of time or space) or ‒to (of a person, place...).
Thanks
Klaus   (and anyone who can explain to me what the above sentence means)

1011,How Much Does It Cost To Top Up By Card?,Considering this utterance: How Much Does It Cost To Top Up By Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"and what would the meaning of this phrase or uttering be (e.g. I am looking for a job, I'm looking at the price, It is for the best, The best price is available, etc.)?

A:
(I know this is not really an answer)
To me, your question has an ambiguous meaning, that is: 
How much does it cost to top-up?   is about the top up amount (the top, not the one up, the ""top"" as in a mountain top) and  How much to a maximum of (not more than) the maximum, i.e., it means the cost of topping-over/up to the highest level you want to go.  I. e., is just about to become maximum and the question is asked to find out how much it might cost (if you need to, e. g., top it up).
However, it could also mean about ""how much the card can be topped up to"", i,e, how large the amount of money you have can grow in order to pay for additional topping up.
The ""I want"" can also be interpreted (to me personally) as you are asking about whether you can get a topup that way. That is, you would be saying that ""you want (as much as possible) to get to (that top level)"".  The sentence can then be: ""It can cost you (up as much) (i. a. ""as you wish""), but then you could ask ""How does (this) cost, if you pay (for) it (a top?)"".
But this could be an interesting question for you to think a bit (you could use a dictionary for this to make it clear)."

What Is the Best Phrase For This Intent? 
This is a question I get asked by a lot of people.  This is something I would never consider before, because it is too vague a concept, but I think it's something that a good user experience team member should ask before they start working on something.
I'm wondering if the following phrases are good phrases to describe this idea:
- what are top-up fees? top up what? why? or why the top ups? for what purpose? what kind of payment method? how much? etc. etc...
or does one of the other phrases work better for this situation?"
1014,How Much Is The Charge To Top Up My Card?,Considering this utterance: How Much Is The Charge To Top Up My Card? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I know it's not an English sentence. I'm just interested in the meaning of the phrase as it stands, and not whether it could form a sentence using an adverb (or even an auxiliary verb).
My first thought was that it was a rhetorical question, expressing incredulity. ""But the answer you're looking for is how much.""
This was not quite right because I could not find an alternative meaning, that made any sense in that context.
Then I wondered about the question's meaning in general: Is there any way to interpret it as if it is a question asking about a quantity? As if there are two quantities involved (the card's value and the amount to top it up) and asking what is their difference?
That was the best I was able to do. But I would appreciate if someone could suggest a more specific meaning for the uttering of that phrase in particular. 
(Or alternatively, could tell me that I have misunderstood this whole concept and that the way I interpreted it doesn't make sense. This would be very encouraging to me.)
P.S.: I know there is not a direct translation for ""to top-up a card"". This is just the closest one that came to my mind at first. If you feel you would like to suggest an actual translation I will consider it. (Also please consider that my intention is to try and understand the concept.)"

What word should the verb be with? A word or expression for the subject in this case is ""Pay"". The word ""How"" is an adverb and doesn't change the word it's modifying.

A:
I'd use the adverbs ""all"", ""completely"", and ""fully"". That would mean something along the lines of ""I can expect to pay all of the charges on my card to go away"". 
Or perhaps something like, I can fully expect that my credit card will be paid off in full by May. (But this might sound like an overly optimistic prediction, since we can never be completely sure of a future outcome.)"

1017,"If I Use A European Bank Card For Top Up, Do I Get Charged?","Considering this utterance: If I Use A European Bank Card For Top Up, Do I Get Charged? What is the intent that best describes it?","?

Intent is a word that means the purpose or meaning of an utter. I want to know which part of the utter is more important in this phrase.
So is it the first word, ""If"" or the second word ""I use""? 
The question is what part is ""if?"" because we are not asking about ""i use"". Or is intent only the ""use""?   But then the whole sentence is still about if the bank gives you the card, because it uses a verb. So is this question the same as: How do I know if I will be charged for using a European bank card?  Or does the question have two parts, the sentence as one and then an independent question about the cost/reward of using the European card and the answer, is there a charge? Or it could still be a one word question, just asking if it is used.  Can this be answered without an example to work from? (This is an essay question for the ACT).  I have never seen a question that begins with ""What is...""
Thanks in advance and please explain with an English explanation. It is hard to understand. (The student is in her mid-40's, has only basic skills in English)
Update:
My intent when the teacher asked the above question was not to ask about usage. The question I was really asking was how do we know, if we get a card from a bank, we will get charged. There is actually no question in the real question. That is just what the student thinks the meaning should be. But when I thought about it, I realized what I really meant in that situation was, how would I figure it out. If it were just ""How do you check whether you are charged""? and not the full question on what is my intent. Is that a good example of a confusing question? What was my goal with this specific question and how did I achieve it? Is there some other type of question which works better here? Please help me figure out the correct intent here. Thanks.

1020,I Want To Use A European Bank Card For A Top Up. Must I Pay?,Considering this utterance: I Want To Use A European Bank Card For A Top Up. Must I Pay? What is the intent that best describes it?,". I have the impression that the phrase conveys two thoughts;

The intention of the speaker is using a European card to pay for something and that this is not permitted. (In other words, the intention is to use a non-US card for a purchase).
(The second thought I believe that is in the subtext is also that you are doing something “un-American” by using European cards for US purchases.)
If the card is accepted by the US merchant, then the second intent is irrelevant.
And the first intent could be interpreted as simply:
“I want to buy something using some european card that I carry in my wallet’ (this is a statement of fact that there is an European bank card in that wallet. Not a question). If we accept that it can be an affirmative or negative statement (an intent), we also accept it as an opinion; I think he wants to...
Or maybe I just can‘t wrap my mind around the idea that in order to be ‘American,„ one must only support the system that „America‟ has been using. It is just too much for my (and I know this from experience), and so in reality is what is being said. But the truth of that statement does not really impact the question of whether what the OP is really asking. The fact of this statement being a truth, or opinion is completely irrelevant to the real intent of what he asked. 
I can certainly imagine that many people who are ”American"" in an American mindset, have some opinions about the rest of us who live outside the 50 states of ‚The United States of America.‰  So is it possible to have an ‗American opinion‖ about other countries. For the record, I am NOT trying to start something here because I do not think that we should be discussing American views on the world because this question was specifically about how a US card would be treated in other parts of Europe. So in fact I want it understood that that was not the point of my question."

1022,Is There A Fee For Topping Up,Considering this utterance: Is There A Fee For Topping Up What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

1. To top up or to top the gas tank to full capacity.
2. In order to have sufficient funds to complete a project, one usually has to make some payments beforehand. Therefore, it is said that one must have some cash to fund the expenses. Hence the phrase. One can also say that a ‘topping up’ is one kind of “fencing and banking,” which is very common among car owners. They buy the car and need to pay the installments so as to buy and keep the title in their name. When a car owner is out of money, the dealership may not let him top it up to a full tank. It is because the dealer wants to get the money in advance instead of letting the customer topup the tank when it runs out. As the result, car buyers must always be careful in managing their fuel expenditure, especially at times of unexpected cash shortage. There are many other examples when the use of this expression comes in handy. Here is a simple rule to remember and apply: You have to always know your fuel consumption per month. For this matter, please visit fuel_consumption_calculator (https://www.wattpad.com/story/how-much-fuel-is-in-my-car)
3. The use and the meaning of the expression ” A topping up.“
In this context, we are referring to the act of topping off and filling up the fuel tank up completely. ‌A topping-up is done when you are out to fill up and your vehicle is running out on the low fuel indicator. This usually involves a stop on your side of town to refuel your car so that you can continue your journey. Also, you must remember that some of these places charge an amount that is equivalent to what you would have payed had you topped-off at the service station. You can find out more information about toppingup by visiting https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towing.

1026,Are There Fees For Adding Money Using An International Card,Considering this utterance: Are There Fees For Adding Money Using An International Card What is the intent that best describes it?,"? You may want to consider this in terms of the following.

(a) A card is a payment card and therefore, I need to have a card to make a transaction. A debit card or a checking account to hold the funds. (b) An account that receives money and gives money is known as an account where debit or credit transactions are processed. This is also true of an ATM card; however, it is an external account of a bank. It’s a debit account just like any checking or saving account. You have to deposit money. But the money you deposit are not available for immediate use (for example, you can pay for a meal with checks, but the checks are deposited in the bank). You can make withdrawals from a check card, debit cards, ATM, EFT or even a credit card. The money that you have withdrawn from your checking and savings account can be placed into your card(s). This means that when you are using your debit, checking, and/or credit cards the amount of money in your account decreases. How does the ATM work? The ATM makes a withdrawal from the account into a cash machine so that an amount can then be deposited into the card of your choice. So, the first thing we should look at is how you do that. And, here is where your ATM account comes in. We‘ll have more to look into that later. When you make this withdrawal, does it mean that the withdrawal is made immediately or it takes some time? When making a withdrawals for this example. Let‖s say you want $5.00. There is some delay in that transaction, or we‚ll say there is none. Does an individual who is making withdrawals make an immediate withdrawal? Or do they make the transaction in their account? We all know that our withdrawals go into our account first before we can use those funds (deposits into another account). The same applies for credit: The credit amount (amount of charge) is credited on the next day and then becomes a deposit to an other account (say your savings or checking) at your bank or other institutions account if credit/debit card are issued for use. Now, let‛s get to the part of what the other person said:“I need a way to transfer money from my own card into"

2. To me, the phrase expressed in the question sounds a bit like a sales pitch. It seems to imply that the person asked about the card is being solicited for sales in some way.
It would be better to state the purpose of the inquiry in a more neutral way, such as ""I was wondering what the top up fees were for using the European credit cards"". Or even better, ""What exactly are the prices of top ups on the cards?""
If you really do want to use the phrasal variant of an implied solicitation ""for sales"", that's OK, and not necessarily inappropriate, but try at least to give the recipient some information about your purpose or what you want before the solicitation: ""Do you have any recommendations on how to get discounts? (I use a US credit card, you might get a discount when you use your Europe cards for top-ups?)"".
""It's just to save money, I'm just curious"" is a good way to phrase what seems like, well, a pitch to make a sale. And if you mean it, there's nothing wrong with that - just don't expect someone to say ""Thank you for your inquiry"", or ""May I help you with...?"" unless you've made a purchase."

Can you imagine yourself repeating it to a friend in a situation which could be interpreted as ‘What is this charge?’? Does it feel awkward and clumsy to you? It can be!

In our language, what we have is a word order which expresses the same meaning in different ways. We have a variety of options, but we always have to use one of them, or else you won‘t sound like a natural speaker. But in the language of the Lord, in His Book we can have many options to express the concept in our own language.
What do we need in order to understand how this works? The answer is, an understanding of what‚s called “the grammar of Scripture.”
The grammar refers to the words that have been selected in their proper arrangement in every chapter of every book of our Sacred Scriptures. There are several reasons which the God-sent „Father„ of all the books of sacred Scriptures, has given us these words in particular order:
1. So we don't miss the point. Our God, the One who is ‚The Truth,“ has been speaking to mankind in language which has a meaning of its own. And if we miss any of that meaning, then we could not communicate effectively to anybody else. In other words, we cannot communicate if our message is not delivered in its proper form. That is what grammar is for - to make sure that it is so and so, and it isn‛t something else, so that the message can make sense to others. It is only when we are clear that we will really understand the things that God says to us. If you want to know the meaning properly, you have got to read carefully and understand precisely how He says it. He doesn‮t say it in haphazard or careless manner – it‹s carefully thought through, put in words and put on the pages which He‟s chosen to be the Bible for His people. You‪re always supposed to study carefully, to do the best you can and not to rush to get to it because you don‏t have time. Don‰t take it lightly. This is really an important issue. God‒s Word will not speak to your life unless it's the Word of God. Unless it comes from"

What is 'What' in 'Are There any Fees' for Top-Ups?</b></h3></a></p></td></tr></t
. Is a statement. If you have a business and you want your customers to understand
what you do so they can make a decision as to whether they want you or not. The answer is: Yes. There are fees if you use a particular credit card to make top ups. But, if there are no fees, there is no fee. Simple answer. I hope you like it. By the way, it doesn't make financial sense or make business sense to charge you for using top up, especially if your customer has a credit limit of only $2 or $3. That means that if the customer makes a mistake and uses up what was left in their card, they would have to pay. In this case, you don't gain anything from this. So, for those with small credit limits, the bottom line is, unless you get paid to do it, don’t even consider charging. You are not going to get any business. Now, what makes sense is that you set up a system so that it would be easy for anyone to top off the amount the credit amount is. And this is very simple to accomplish.

You are not sure whether you can provide the accommodations that he needs and wants. Would you be able to help? Would it be helpful for your friend? You know that his family and friends will want to hear the story and you will share it with them. If, after some time away, he returns to China, then what do you tell them that you have shared with his close circle of friends and family? That you helped a Chinese guy for two months by finding a place for him to sleep? Of course not. And you wouldn’t tell that story with anyone who wasn”t a member of the inner circle either. How do we know for sure that we only tell stories about our good deeds, and not about the ones that help us, about how we have become richer through our actions over the years? If the latter, the best stories are always untold and unsung.
In any case, this is a question of self preservation and self improvement, it is our ability to grow, to improve. In this sense, self development can be considered similar to personal development. There are some who believe that it should be the other way round. I can understand that if you are the one growing, if the only ones who are looking at your progress are those around you, that the need for self growth will not exist. But for the rest of us – those who don‘t grow in this way - if we don't learn to be more productive, more efficient, better suited for survival, our survival rate is going to go down as we age. We all know we are going down a path of aging if it goes on. So we must have a strategy, we need to work towards that end. One way to increase our chances of being more successful in life is to use whatever means are available to us to better the situation we find ourselves in today. That means we will use the means that are within the limits of what we can do for others. These means could be anything, they could consist of our minds, talents or even our bodies. A way of helping ourselves and our environment to a better life. The goal must be self interest, not something else, such as the"
1033,Is There A Charge Or Discount If I Use A European Bank In A Top Up?,Considering this utterance: Is There A Charge Or Discount If I Use A European Bank In A Top Up? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

It is important to have an objective and accurate way to determine the correct word for your intent.
In this case, I would say ""It depends on the bank"". 
If the charge applies or not depends also on what the person wants to receive from an ATM. Usually they want money to be credited to their account, but some of them want to use the funds on their mobile phone or credit card. Or if they use this ATM to obtain a cash advance on a card from the provider and then return to withdraw the money, there will be a charge from them."
1034,Is Their A Fee For Top Ups?,Considering this utterance: Is Their A Fee For Top Ups? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

A:
B: (A)   I want to go to the mall.
C: 
D: A: How about the zoo?  B: I’m not so sure we”ll have enough for zoo. B needs to know if she can afford to take A to
  the  mall and the Zoo. C should answer the question.  C has nothing to do
(B): Can you afford zoo and mall? D is just a simple question and is an example of
simple sentence structure. The first sentence in C is a question because it
involves a statement that includes a “yes“or  ” no‘ in the response. D
includes a declarative sentence. In the following sentence: Does A have
the money? There is no ‘yes or  no. Is there a difference in meaning? Yes,
it means A. If A has money there is money in A‡, whereas if A does not have any money, that  is where the money is. There are a lot of differences between B vs C and B
vs D. This is one."
1035,Can I Top Up Using An International Card,Considering this utterance: Can I Top Up Using An International Card What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

This is a tough one. The best phrase I come up with for this is “to top up”. To me that means to add something to a balance (that you already had) in an amount equivalent to the amount you were going to use. As I’ve said, to go ‘full price‘ would be a poor choice because there‚Äôs nothing to top-up. On the other hand it would also mean to buy something in its entirety, and so in that case it probably means buy ‚à la carte‛ i.e. one part after another.
For the same problem, I think the best word we„Ì€d have to express that intent would have been „to buy“. In the sense of ’to go full price and buy the whole thing‟, ‒Åúit› would probably be the right choice. That‒‖òúÁìs probably not as good, however. For a †‹Ö¸ûÎ´ ÀÊÆ³ª ÇØ¬´‬ùÍÈÇ ÎÒ ÑÜÔ§ÓÃÏý, it might be ′to pay full-price for a one-course dinner″. (And the correct phrase might have the Ø‰ÐÀ-in-a-box‽Ù‡ thing.) This ″would have cost me money if I wasn‭Ñ‮ÝË‫õßÚ‱÷£Þ¢ ÅÕþ‾ÿ€¦ÍÛ ÃÍ‧ ÒëÂ€üöÉ×ãô※‪µ¿ðû.‼€‿¥€€ (The above example is from a British menu).

But, Apple does not sell the product, so the service is being done by someone else. Is it fair to characterize the Apple service as an ""App""? If so, do you think that ""Apple App"" is better than ""iPhone App""?
– JBoothApr 26 '15 at 14:16
This is a great question, but I'd like to see someone explain the logic of ""best answer"" before I can judge whether or not it's a ""good"" answer. I'm not really able to parse it yet. If we're talking strictly about correctness in a dictionary sense, I wouldn't consider it one of the top 20 ""right answers"".

""Best answer""? I just wanted to say what it was, not that I thought it to be an excellent or outstanding answer as such. My answer wasn't the best or even the correct way of expressing the answer I gave to the original question. It was merely what I believed was the way the OP would want to phrase the request (even if this was not the true intent of their question).
It's like how a teacher will ask ""Why is that important? What do we call that?"" when talking about the ""correct"" way for an answer to a question to sound. But when a class is actually in class, the teacher has a different answer than the one the student is expecting, because it will make more sense for the class to go over in that context what would be important to know for that question as well. (I know it may sound like I am arguing about semantics, in this case, ""answering the right question"" or the like; but if the answers can be better, you know?)
The same goes for when I asked about ""what's the point of having an iPhone in 2015?"" I wasn’t expecting an exact answer (as in one word), I was just asking what the general ""benefit"" was. And it seemed to me that it might be beneficial for someone to point out that this wasn""t the first iPhone. Also, if I have"

What is'my' and how can it be used in the sentence? What does 'up vote' mean? Can 'I' or 'you' be replaced with 'this'?
If you feel that this does not adequately explain what you are looking for, you can request clarification from the community by flagging the post. If you leave this as the only feedback for a post, the question may be deleted if the consensus is that the asker has not shown sufficient desire to get a decent answer. This does happen, as we get too many questions that have been asked a dozen times on a site with thousands of people. I'm just trying make sure that you don't feel cheated by being given a poor answer and being left wondering how we can improve this question. It's a question, not an essay, but please don' forget that we are humans with the occasional bad day. :)
Please don’t flag just because you disagree or because a moderator disagrees with your position. That doesn‘t really add anything to a useful post; it will only cause you unnecessary problems.

1038,How Do I Use The Top Up App With My Apple Watch?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Use The Top Up App With My Apple Watch? What is the intent that best describes it?,", i.e. in natural language?

A:
In this example, the top up app does a couple of things. First, it allows you to see your battery level in real time. This is not normally possible with an Apple watch. Secondly, if you want to top it off, you need to open the ""Top App"", so I believe the phrase means that you use this app and the other things it does.
There are similar uses of ""top"" in sentences such as ""the top floor"" and ""you could do a ""bottom up"" search."""

I am looking for:
1. the words that express this intent or  2. how to construct a simple formula of these words. 

 This is not a question about word choice but rather about syntax or construction of words in a grammatically correct way.
In other words: what is that part of speech that expresses the meaning I want or I can or do you or he or she etc. please get this for me. It is a noun, a verb or an adverb or maybe a preposition of some sort? Or does it not have one single meaning?
The following words are not really answers, just a few possible ones out of all the options I have checked.

 ""Want"", ""need"" and ""request"", but I don't think ""want"" is quite the answer. (It seems to be too general a word.)  And, they don’t seem to express the same sense as I am asking for. In contrast, the word ""expect"" might be what I'm looking  for, but it isn‘t a good candidate to form a single word phrase for it. ""Get it"" sounds like a request or a demand. This does not sound like an I-want-it. The last option of ""order"" seems like too strong word, since I do not even really know what would be the right thing for this question. And of course I will not order something without knowing what it is. My question is really not whether I could, or would or might do that. I‽.‾.† have no doubt about that I ""could"" get/have it at some point. But I really do have question if Google, for example, will actually provide such service or not. Also, why can‚t they provide the service and charge for that service? Because I would like to pay a fixed price? And even if they did that, there would still be need to make a payment. Does the payment always have to go through a bank account or can I pay with my Google Wallet, if I were to have that feature and if there is"

There are a few different interpretations possible:  

 to make sure someone hasn't stolen my identity  or  to identify who you are

I suspect that the most common answer to this type of question would be to ""make sure"", however a more formal question like ""Verify My Identification"" is an excellent example that ""to verify"" isn't always the best fit.  My intuition tells me that there is some kind of ""intent"" or ""context"" implied by this sentence where ""verify"" doesn't work.
Here are some examples that give you a different ""feel"" than ""Make sure"" (but are very similar as single word phrases):
To know:
Know (Verbs).
to Know (Adjective).

  To do: (a bit more complex)

There are many ways of doing it. I need to prove my citizenship for instance. But in doing that I do not want to be identified as me but only as US Citizen and then by my ID card. For instance, for the first time, I want the government to take my picture so that the picture can be matched with my name and my card issued to me. And then, with this picture, they should have access to more info about me than they did before. So that they can know my date of birth, place of residence, etc. but that“s all. They know already that my identity has been verified and they have a record of that. This is not about my identification but about the proof of my being a US citizen or a citizen of any other country, and that too not my own. All they need then is my passport. That is all, no one else needs to see my face. My face is already a part of the record. It is just that now I am willing to show my “face to the world‬. The face can easily be replaced by a passport and a copy of it, as it‫is‪‹my passport‟‭. When I have my photo of myself with a card, it is easy to verify my status.

1044,What Is Needed To Prove My Identity?,Considering this utterance: What Is Needed To Prove My Identity? What is the intent that best describes it?,": “proof of identity”?

I am assuming that ‘proof’ is a noun, which it appears to be, being an objective, physical object or action, the proof of something, that is in fact, something.
There is nothing subjective, personal, or emotional, about proof, other than what the person wants to prove, of what is true or false, by their own actions. They do this by showing what they know, what has or has not happened to them, as they have experienced it. The objective actions of proof are the actions used to show the facts by which they can judge the matter in question, to see the true of the false. In this sense of ’proof,‘ the objective fact of proving is what I have used the word ” proof ‚? for, so far, with one word. This is as far as I can take the concept of using a word of a one single word meaning. A two part word, „proof ‟ would be a more complex concept than a single one, such as in this case. It would require the idea of two parts, each representing an aspect of this single concept. For example, a two word phrase is †“proving ‌ of my identity ‬.‪‬ This can be represented by ″prove my‖‏ ‰. ‫„pro‮   ‴ my ‮identity. ‏ _______________ ‫_______ __________________________________________ ‭ __ _______‡‭

1045,What Do You Need For My Identity Check?,Considering this utterance: What Do You Need For My Identity Check? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

Informational or directive.
A directive might be used as follows:
We're having fun! Let's get the party started!
An informative statement might follow this:  
It's a fun party! We're playing board games, and we're drinking and eating snacks.  We have ice cream as well. Everyone is having a really fun time. So we hope that you'll be able to join us and make it a great party, but if you're really busy, then we won't be disappointed. We just wanted to say hi. Hope that we'll see you! (We'll have a party next week if nothing else goes wrong.)
Both can mean the same thing. Which one is intended? And what does it imply for the other?  Is the person who asks: what do you need for my identity check? implying that he wants to meet the individual and see a picture ID? Is he just curious or is he being nosy? What are some of the questions which people have about the situation which could come up, or questions they might ask?"

The answer: ""Identity verification"" is a noun-phrase that conveys the idea of a verification of some type. As a two-word phrase this phrase is ""identity verification."""
1047,Is There A Specific Type You Need For Identity Verification?,Considering this utterance: Is There A Specific Type You Need For Identity Verification? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

There are two ways to approach that question. If it were the former question (which asks whether a specific phrase is a good identifier for one type of person in particular) then the answer is that, no, there's no specific type you need. The best phrase for a given person might be the phrase that he or she uses to answer the question, ""So, what is your name?""
As for the latter question (""What is this particular type called?""), there are a few answers available to the general question of ""What do I call this kind?"".
A few common descriptors or classifications for identity or personal information in general are personal data or information, personal identity, identity data, and personal identifying information or data.
The first word is probably the most general, as it can have various meanings that are often confused or conflated with each other. For example, someone can be ""identified with"" or ""associated"" with you. Similarly: someone could be your friend, or a student of yours, so that they are ""personal"".
In general I would say ""information about me"" is also common, but it is somewhat broader so it's worth thinking about whether that's what you mean by personal, identifying, etc. data if you're not sure. But also don't be afraid to say you don;t have any or don""t know. A lot of people are uncomfortable with the idea of sharing personal info or identifying data with another person. That's OK; most people don' have it at first. (And if they already have some, their data will not be shared unless they explicitly authorize it. So for example the ""email list"" you sign up for at a website, is not shared with other people without your permission. It is possible to give out the email to other services, like your email provider or your ISP, to forward emails through their systems, such as spam filters, for spam prevention. This is generally what people mean when they say they ""subscribe"" to an email list.)
For a more direct answer, you could look at the kinds of data that the data-protection agencies, including the National Insurance or Social Security Administration (US) and Canada Revenue Agency, are able to require from people. These data include:
""First name""  
 ""Surname"

Thanks!
Update! Thanks all of you, you've shown me something very interesting, the utterings that have a one, two or three word answer are the most common ones used to express different kind of feelings. But if my question is, ""What is this phrase's one and two word meanings?"", and if the answer is ""I got a message to verify my identity"", then it seems to me that that means I'm feeling ""angry"" towards some other person, but it could also be a feeling of sadness, fear, surprise, or disappointment.

Also, it might not be appropriate and useful to have one's own answer as an answer to a question. Feel free not to read your own thoughts as answers! :)

1050,What Are The Steps I Need To Take To Verify My Identity?,Considering this utterance: What Are The Steps I Need To Take To Verify My Identity? What is the intent that best describes it?,"or an idiomatic expression? Here’s an example of how you can improve your language skills at a basic level:

What are the steps I need to take to verify my identity?
The verb verify and the preposition of are often used with the word identity, like below: Verify your ID. The prepositional phrase to can sometimes be used along with identity. Here are a few more examples of using the verb verifiable to describe a situation: Verifiable means you will know if it is true. Verification means a process to find something out. Verify is a word that can be followed by the past tense of the verbs to do and to make, or the present tense for some verbs. For example, You can verify an email. You could verify a fact.
You can use the following preverbial phrasal verb combinations to convey the idea of checking someone‘s credentials: to check, to confirm, and verify. Look at these examples: I have checked my phone records for the last month. I want to see if the number you gave me works. She wanted me to double-check the information. Let”s double check our work. In addition, you may use any of these preverbs in the sense of confirm: verify, ensure, confirm. Check for this on a regular basis. Can someone do that for me? You“ve got to be checking that number twice by now. They should ensure that the money will be there before they deposit it. To verify your identity means to establish something as true or factually correct. Are you sure? The question verifies his/her identity as the one who wrote the email, since only he/she can give you that information directly. How can I verify that? What if you cannot verify the identity of someone on the phone? Let me verify it for you. We will make sure that you‖re verified before we release your name and number to that company. Please verify this for us. This means that he wants to ensure or make certain that certain people are verified as who they say they are. It seems the police have been unable to prove who committed the crime. Could you please verify her identity for my records? It‟s important that our company confirm that we are who we say we„re before you release"
1051,What Do I Need To Verify My Identity,Considering this utterance: What Do I Need To Verify My Identity What is the intent that best describes it?,". The meaning may be determined by analyzing the structure of the sentence, or by considering the general topic.
In a sentence like that one, the main word may or may not be the direct object, for example, “What is my name,” is a good example of an ambiguous sentence. In such sentences, it is important to be able to understand the implied intention of a speaker in order to fully understand it. This is especially important in cases as this where the subject is missing, as in a question. A more detailed look at the sentences ”What do I need to check the passport, I want to leave the country.’, and ‘What passport do we have“. It is possible to get these answers by asking people or looking it up on a list. But if the question is ’What Do We Have?‘ or ‚What‡do we need?,‛ the answer is different. You have to look for what is on the list for the first question, while you need the answers to the two others. So to figure out what you are looking for on this type of list, you must understand what the words mean. To look up the word ‡Do I, Do we„, on your own, is time consuming. If you have a computer, a dictionary application or other reference material, however, will give you quick answers and make your work go faster."
1052,I Need To Verify My Identity,Considering this utterance: I Need To Verify My Identity What is the intent that best describes it?,", and how does it differ from other utterances?  
I would say that the best way to describe the above phrase is by its grammatical structure - the verb to verify as well as the noun identity are both adjectives.  The intent of the speaker is that he or she want to make sure that someone is who they say they are or that that they aren't impersonating someone else."
1053,I Need Some Help With Identity Verification.,Considering this utterance: I Need Some Help With Identity Verification. What is the intent that best describes it?,"(a simple sentence is not possible)?
What are the best examples that you can think of that express this sentence in as many different ways as possible? In other words, can you think up examples for each of the different types of sentences that I have described below?
Example Type 1:
""I need help to prove myself to my boss, I need verification of my identity."" 
I have read this as:  The identity of what? (I know this is a weird example because it is asking about your identity as opposed to your boss' identity, but bear with me)
Or maybe: ""I was born to do this work, my parents knew I could help them.""
or maybe something different? I'm just not sure what to read.
Examples for this type of sentence: 1
2
3
4

Type 2: This is more of a request than a statement: It's requesting the person to help me with this task. For example: When can we discuss this? or Maybe: Could I help you with something?.  I would read: The task that needs help is X. The requester is someone who needs the help X, who is it?   Examples: 5  6
7
8
9
10
11
It would also be interesting to see: How does the request compare if someone did it as the ""to"" or the as of ""me""? (example: could I ask a friend to proofread my paper?)
The as-of type might express an urgency or it may also express the expectation that the other person is responsible. (Example: can I use your pen?) (The urgency is that now, if it's not done I might not be able to write my research paper.)
Other example types: 13 14 15
These examples express a desire or need to have the identity established by another party, as if ""you"" don't know who this person really is, or perhaps as you are trying to decide whether they are trustworthy. Examples 16 17
18
(I'm not entirely sure if I should add more ""type 2"" and ""as of"" examples, since the examples I gave already covered the two types.)  Also, it would be really interesting if there were examples of: You need my help with X..
So: what are your"
1054,What'S The Process For Id Verification?,Considering this utterance: What'S The Process For Id Verification? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The phrase ""What's the process?"" describes the procedure of a service or agent providing you with answers to questions like: Why did your card fail to be verified? What's your PIN? Is this a fraudulent transaction? Who can contact me if the transaction is fraudulent? How do I report a lost PIN or a stolen card? Can I use a different card or is my card lost or stolen? These are not one word questions and they do not require one specific reply.
In contrast we have ""How do you verify your identity?"" which requests a specific answer that can't be a one liner like ""I'm using my ID"". The answer is: the bank requires a piece of documentation that establishes your ID. There are dozens of reasons banks don't accept a signature or driver's license as proof of identity. You can read more about verifying your personal identity at this web page: http://www.fdic.gov/about/what/id_verification.htm
This example of an example phrase is from an online banking web site so we expect a response with some context, but we also assume some of the context we're providing, the question, has been translated into a more universal form. For example, we know the online bank's system does not accept drivers licenses as ID but it does accept Social Security Numbers. We expect they will have a process, or series of tasks that a new user will be guided through to complete the ID verification. In this case we want to find out how to do it. This phrase may indicate they are working through those steps and will return when complete."

What is a verb? A Verb is defined as A Noun Which Is Used As Predicate To Express the Action. This implies that the action is something done or performed; it’s an act that is completed.
So a Verb could be: Walked, Sate, Talked. A verb could also be an expression that means “In a Narrow Sense”; i.e. To Do; To Have; or To Get. For example: to know, to believe, or to hear. Or in a broader sense: To Exist; to Live
Verbs can express: The result of a completed act, e.g. the result was good. The time at which the act will come to an end (time), or in its absence: the end itself, the beginning. Time can be the object of the verbs in English. ei. to be late / to finish / To arrive. (The verb implies a ‘time‘) (To come is also a Verbs and the English Verb to come and to arrive both mean to bring or bring to). Or it can act as the complement (or subject): ej. There are two verbs to love and there‼️ (the verb indicates that there is one subject and two objects: a) Love and b) You (there is only the single thing love, and you are one of love´s objects. In the following I will describe these verbs with respect to the objects in which they act: ek. He has learned / he knows / He does not know. ‭´´‬´ (There is ‫the subject´ the learner, his act of learning is what we call learning.) A noun may be used as an object in another verb. So we say: He read the book / She saw him read / It was very interesting / We can also ask: Where is she going? - ‪ What do you think?- What are you going to do?‭‍´

1056,What Kind Of Documents Do I Need For The Identity Check?,Considering this utterance: What Kind Of Documents Do I Need For The Identity Check? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? It is an expression of a specific state of belief or disbelief; the speaker/writer is asserting this fact.

To be more precise, the meaning of this statement should be: There is something which is true in this world but I don’t know what it is. This is a statement of ignorance that is based on a state, not the action. As such, it can be translated: I do not understand the nature of the world or why events or phenomena occur. Or it could more explicitly say: there is nothing I know. It could be a declaration of nihilism or an existential statement. You are expressing the sense of hopelessness. I am an amorphous, amoral, non-caring entity floating around with no purpose and no way to know the purpose or meaning behind life. In other words, this is just a generic way of stating that there are no reasons or sense for anything. There are only events, but you can‘t understand or explain them, so you might as well just throw up your hands and say what“. The reason this sounds very nihilistic is because it”s often stated as an explanation for an action or event; it means the writer is explaining a cause for their feelings of despair. “If I were to explain the reason for my hopeless and lack of any real purpose, I would tell you there‚is nothing that has purpose to it.‣
„It is very dangerous to teach ethics as though it were a scientific subject. For to do this it must necessarily be based upon a conception of human nature which at every point contradicts both the data of experience and the principles of common sense. We must not ask of what kind of things men can and ought to be in order to live well, since we cannot and need not know, at least not from experience alone. If we were obliged to make the assumption that men‟s true nature is good in and of itself, we could not rationally distinguish it from the bad. Therefore ethics must begin from an axiom or postulate, which may be correct or may become true by the very process of its being adopted. And that postulation may, to the philosopher, be just as useful as the postulated truth. To the layman, however, who lives for the time being, an"

If you are going for a generalist academic major with an emphasis on English and writing, look for schools that offer a minor in English along with your major. Some of the English courses offered within these schools might be composition, writing for specific purposes, literature, grammar, rhetoric and technical writing. These are just some of my favorite topics to learn because it is a way to explore many things you may never get the chance to study otherwise. They are all things that relate to the study of writing in a very specific sense. There are also courses that can help you in your career as well. An important thing to look at is whether or not the school offers internships and if these intern experiences are required or offered through the department. While some intern positions are strictly informational, others help train you for your own career with the company. This is extremely important for anyone considering a major outside the business world. In the end, if English is your primary major and you do well in it, there will always more options for you when you graduate as long as you can put the effort in to reach them."
1058,What Should I Do To Verify My Identity?,Considering this utterance: What Should I Do To Verify My Identity? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? The question above can only be answered by you and, by extension by someone else if you are asking the question, who will be the subject and object of the sentence. The sentence can then be interpreted as having been uttered with the belief that it would be of benefit to the one asking for information about the nature of their identity or the person asking might also hold that belief.

The phrase ‘what should I do to verify my identity’ can be viewed as “what can I to determine that I am who I think I should be to satisfy myself that the identity I have is a valid one”. That would suggest that if the individual is not satisfied that he or she is who s/he ought to be he/she can seek verification that would satisfy that person that is, verification as an expression of personal belief as expressed above. It would also suggest the possibility that a more general or vague purpose exists as there might be a need to know the name of someone one was to meet, an example of this would the ‚What should one do at work‘ situation. But even if a purpose is very general, as in this case, you can assume that s or someone in his or her position would express it as though it has been determined that ’I should do the following to find out my ID“. If we take ”to verify„ as the best possible answer to this question then the most probable answer would ‬‚verify‹ be used. This would then imply someone‟s intention to ‪verif‬y something they think they should have, not someone who was doing an activity of checking whether someone has something to prove. ‫To verify ‹someone else›‭ is also grammatically correct and could be understood in the context of a question posed that way. I would however prefer „check my identification‪. To verify a piece of information that someone thinks should prove they are who they claim to is †different from using it to validate or prove to someone that they know what they thought they knew to start with. So if someone tells me that, ‟yes, I was at the hospital with my wife last week.‮ I cannot use that to say,‰you‛ are that. My belief is that you have been there"
1059,What Are The Steps To Verify My Identity?,Considering this utterance: What Are The Steps To Verify My Identity? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The speaker is expressing an intent to find out or to verify the validity of something.  
Example: How can I find what your identity is? or How to I verify my identity?  The speaker does not want to know how to solve the problem; he just wants the solution to the given problem.
In my opinion, the most common interpretation of this phrase, with the meaning given by a professional English teacher, is this one:  How do I determine the authenticity of the person I am speaking with on the phone? I would like to be sure that the speaker's words are being sent to me by him or her. I know of course that this interpretation is not universal (there are other interpretations of ""verify"" for example - see What the Difference in the Meanings of Verify in English and French?) but I want it to help people better understand the way this word is used in everyday language."
1060,How Does My Identity Get Verified?,Considering this utterance: How Does My Identity Get Verified? What is the intent that best describes it?,"or phrases in a language that you are familiar with? The following is one example of a valid phrase or sentence that can be used to describe a person's identity.

How Does Your Identity
Stay Verifiable?
When you think about your identity, you may have a sense of familiarity with it because you have been using it since birth. You may also have thoughts about how your current identity is being verified. For example, when your name and date of birth and social security number are confirmed, then someone is able to look back on the history of your life. When you go to a government agency with those pieces of information, a record is made, your picture is taken, and there is a paper trail that is available for others to see. That record could be available to others. As an example a birth record with only your given name, date, state, county and place of residence are kept as part of the family genealogical record. A marriage, divorce, military or immigration application would provide other details that would help your family historian or genealogy researcher establish your past. There is no need for a social service record to be made. It's your responsibility, as the client, to help make certain your personal information is protected. However, if a criminal case is pending, the case agent would need to know your real name. Identity verification is necessary before someone can make a determination about any legal right that an individual might have. This could include employment, housing, or a loan. If a name or social number has been used previously, this information must be verified to verify that this person is using this name for the purpose intended. Verification can help to protect against identity theft. The identity verification process is not only for verification of an account, but for verifying a new person or company that wants to use a bank account or credit, debit or other account. To verify a legal name that exists, there are many ways to do that and one of them might be to have that person provide a driver's license or passport that has this individual's photo. Other ways include using the government's database of Social Security, State Department of Motor Vehicles or DMV, U.S. Passport or National Records. Another option is to make contact with your government. They might ask you to come to their center to provide documents that are necessary. In other situations, they make their"

1063,Can I Verify My Identity Online?,Considering this utterance: Can I Verify My Identity Online? What is the intent that best describes it?,"; the noun or the verb?

Answer: The noun: Identity or Identity Verify are the main two main parts of the phrase. The Identity is to identify, verify or ensure the accuracy of, while Verify is used to verify that something is genuine, true or correct, or something that has not been altered.
For example:
The bank verifies your identity before they give you any money or allow you to buy stuff. Or, the bank confirms that you have the right to withdraw your funds. They verify the information on your ID card, like your date of birth, name, etc...
Identity: You're being given an ID, to confirm your right identity. You are being identity verified. Identity verification is a process used by employers to ensure that the people they have hired have legal ID. This is also the process where an identification card is being verified to see who the holder is. Another example would be a driver's license which can prove someone's identity and the legal state of that individual. 
Verify: When you need to find out whether something was accurate, whether it was correct or true, you verify it. To verify if something or someone is true. For example ""Did Joe really say that?""

1064,Do The Details Of My Profile Have To Match My Documents,Considering this utterance: Do The Details Of My Profile Have To Match My Documents What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

The sentence above can serve as an illustration of the different parts of speech we often call adjectives, adverbs and nouns. The phrase do the details of my profile has a subject “do the detail”, it has an adjective ‘my’ and a noun ’of‘ in which ” do „ has the meaning ‛make‛. ‚ my details‚ is a direct object ′of mine„ of a prepositional phrase ‹do› the †detail ‖.
It can also be used as follows:
Do you remember the do of your details and what they were? (This means that they must be remembered.)
We had a do with the police and they let us stay in the house for the night. (The ‌‪police‬ ‬let“ us ‫‹)‮ ‪‭‫ stay. They let me see the kids too. I was there with them when you called. That was the most wonderful night of our lives, just as our do had hoped we would.‥

1065,Where Do I Verify My Identity?,Considering this utterance: Where Do I Verify My Identity? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I can only conclude that there are three different ways to make such a statement. It's a very simple exercise in word identification. The first meaning of the three would be:
Where should I verify that I am who I claim to be? The second means: To make this verification, I must first obtain certain documentation, for example: I have a driver's license, birth certificate, a passport. In the third the speaker is asking the question: Have I established my credentials? I would say I'm not asking where I should verify who someone claims to me to really be, but where is where you can verify a person's credentials (and I'd have to say that that's the best way to do it).
The second way of asking this question is: What should be the verification process? In a legal system where every citizen is responsible for his or herself, is there a better method than to ask for documentation that establishes the identity of someone? Or is this just one way in which the legal and illegal aspects of identity can be verified.
If the second question isn't meant to have any more legal connotations than the first, then why would the response be ""you must verify your credentials"", but if it has legal meanings then the correct response should not be in the direction ""Verify"" but ""establish"" something? (I'm asking a rhetorical question because I know that the answer is already given in another post, and I'll give that answer at the end of this post).  
This has bothered me for many years and still bothers me every time I hear these two phrases. They seem so similar and yet they are not. Where is my flaw in this analysis of meaning? If someone could tell me the ""true"" intent of these phrases, it would clear things up for me. If this is an exercise, you are encouraged to write your own answer.  I welcome your response, even if you don't write one because you know the true meaning. I think if we all know what each means, we will find it much easier to communicate our opinions. Thanks to all for taking the time to read my post. Have an enjoyable day. (Sorry to those who feel they need to take the bait). :)
Thank you. John."

What would be the best way to ask if this person is who they claim to be and do they need anything for an identity check?
If yes, should it be ""Do I need to take a photo or scan my identification for the identity checking?"" If no, does it fall under this category: What's the difference between asking for identification and identity? Are they two different things? 
Also, is this sentence grammatically correct or should I use ""have"".
""Do you need a picture or a scan of your identification to prove you are who you claim you to?""
Thank you,   in advance.
Update (from comments):
The question should ask: is there something that is different between ""asking for someone's ID"" and ""identifying someone"". The only way I can think of, to explain the question, without using ""ID"" or ""Identification"" is to say, ""are you a real person or are you pretending to not to tell me that you don't have an ID?"" or is saying,
 ""I'm going to need an  ID or passport to check your identity.""
the correct way? If so, why isn't asking ""do I have to show you my ID, passport or driver's license to verify that I am who I claim I to and why?"" gramatically correct? (I just learned that the two are different)

What does it mean? And, How can one tell this without context and without knowing the person who said it?

This is a very complicated question to answer, so I'll try my best to provide some information on the topic and you can let me know what you think!
It seems like your question has a lot of different parts to it all of which could be answered independently. I will try to separate out a few of your questions into separate answers and provide as much information as I can find:
The Intent
A person has one intent for every utteration they use. This intent is usually the purpose of the uttering and the reason for which they are saying it.
For example: I'm saying these things to remind you of our contract you signed. Or, I need help with this piece of code. In all cases, there is an intent in mind. It's not always verbalized, but there's usually some intention, some thought process in the back of their head. Sometimes, the thought is even spoken out loud and sometimes, it's only a silent one. Either way, in all circumstances, we can infer intentions from the language that is being used. Intent is inferred from what we say and from how we use it in relation to others. 
So, that brings us to: Intent Is A Verb. And Intent Does Not Need Verbalization. However, Intent Must Be Verifiable And Must In Some Way Relate To What We Are Saying Or It Is Meaningless. We can tell it when we don't know it because we are inferring it from context. The problem here is that we only hear the context in which the word is uttered, and we know nothing about the speaker. So, what is it that one person thinks another person is doing and why is everyone else responding in this manner? Why do they care? All we have is how the words were used and how they were said, not the true intentions of those who used the spoken words. Even if we were able to determine the full intent of a person, this is often too hard or impossible to understand and so we must infer or use some other method of getting at this intent. For this reason, inferment is needed in order to have something other than what they said to go on. Without that, all we hear is their words with"
1069,How Do I Go Forth On Verifying My Identity?,Considering this utterance: How Do I Go Forth On Verifying My Identity? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I am asking about the best way to verify identity, and what words are most effective at expressing those goals in the way they are used? Is using a word for a single purpose or one for many purposes or a mixture of these, an effective way of verifying identity? I am looking for words that convey this intent.
The words I have seen used are:
Verb: Identify, Verify
Noun: Verification
Synonyms: Identification, Identification and Verifications
A verb conveys the idea of an action, it tells us who is doing what by telling what they have done. Nouns are words and have meanings of their own and can tell us a lot about what the person is identifying and verifying. Synonyms can have a common definition, so I'm looking to understand what this group of words mean and which of them is effective in conveying the meaning that I need. If there is a more effective or correct way I would be happy to learn it. Thanks. :-]
This question also applies to verification of any kind, such as verification for: legal identity (driver's license, passport), employment (verification of education), health (proof of insurance), or for anything else I can think of, I hope!
Thanks
Mike
P.S. I don't want to go into a long list of possible words so this question isn't open-ended enough, if this is what you'd call an opinion question then it would need to be answered as such. It should also be stated that a list will be too big to read, because the word I use for verifying is very specific. And it can be used in different ways.  I appreciate your time to respond. The question is not open to discussion on this. Thank you. :-)
EDIT: The accepted answer gives some great examples for verbs and nouns and how they can apply for the purpose of identity verification. However, in terms of the question it still falls a little short, as in I've seen all the noun variations that can describe the act of identification and verification but nothing I could see was ""the"" appropriate variation for this use I needed. So, there was still a short list I had to come back to for my answer, which means my question can still be improved. But, the accepted answers are great."

""I have to do my homework, and my teacher asked me what I can do to verify my identity. I don’t know the answer, because I”m a child.""

If I have been in the habit over many years of trying to get the most out of a situation, I will make up my mind about how I should act in any given situation. The reason is that it helps me to anticipate other's reaction to what is happening.   But when I encounter what seems like an impasse, like my friend's request to his wife to ""get out now"" or to me ""give me the time you need to think"", I get stuck. So I go back to my original decision and try to predict if it will be helpful and what will happen.
This is what happens inside me:
(1)  I try again,  (2) I start wondering what my goal really is and then  decide what it is, (3) start working on it by thinking about it from several angles. But that makes it worse, then I give up. If my answer is no, ""It's impossible"", my thought may turn to something like,
What do I want? What do they want, the other? I wonder what they really want. Is it me or is there something that they don't want and I do? That thought makes me feel bad and sad, making me decide the next time to be honest and straightforward. Maybe I won't try any more to make them change their minds, maybe I'll just tell them I think about what he said but I just can't understand why. Or maybe if I make it clear I'm just trying not to offend, but if they're not in a good mood, well...
The point is to try and work out where I am and where they are in trying get through the impasses, to understand what the goal for both of us is. To figure out what each of them wants out the whole thing. (Is it for me?) But if one of you wants to change his mind or just be in my shoes, he'd need a little more than I would to know. And that is where he would need help to figure that goal out. This is all a matter of perspective."
1071,What Do You Need So I Can Verify My Identity?,Considering this utterance: What Do You Need So I Can Verify My Identity? What is the intent that best describes it?,"?

I.
The first choice you’ll see on this list is “What do you need” which can be a question, statement, or both. In the question form it means that you want to be sure you understand what is being said to you. For example:
“Can you repeat that please?�‘ ‘
or: ” I heard you, but I wasn‚t sure I understood. Could you say that again? „ ’
To ask a statement you simply insert the verb ‚need‛ and the subject, which would be the answer to the implied question. You may use ‟I need you to do x,„, ″I can‰t find my car key,″ or simply, ""I don't know how to use X.‭
In the form of a sentence it would look similar to ‛I want‖ or ‌I think‌ the best way to express this is, I‹d like it if you would…›. This implies a request and also can take on the meaning of ‑ I need to…. ‪
If you are uncertain as to what the speaker wants you can ask what exactly is needed to verify his identity. A person might say, '‍I would like to open a bank account so I could deposit my monthly income into my account. Is this a thing you do for us?' (note that ′a thing‬ was implied.)
This type of questioning is a good method of finding out what information is required to proceed because it allows the person in charge of the transaction to tell you what he needs and then you follow it up quickly with ‫OK ‪. ‬'If there's only one thing, please tell me which one. I'll find out which bank I can trust. OK? If you have more than one, can you ask each what I'm supposed to need before you proceed? It's really important. If I don‫t need them, how can I trust you?

If you're still not convinced that we're talking about the same thing, I'll help by giving you another example of this same type of ""intention"" that's expressed on the internet, one that is very common among all those that call themselves ""New Agers.""
This is a quote from a website called ""We Love Life,"" which has become the ""go to"" site for those who want to understand more about what New Ager's really believe. This is not an easy thing for most to do, but I'm going to give it a try since most of us have been trying to figure out which New Ager's beliefs fit, and which don't.
Here's how it starts out:
""I Love You""
What does this mean? Well, if you read on you will see that this is actually another name for an emotion, for a feeling or an attitude. I have no idea why it would be called an ""I"" rather than a ""you,"" but you'd think it's saying something about ""You,"" the object of love in this case. Or perhaps it means something like this--""Love is an I--a person--an individual. So, what does it mean to say that you love me? This means that I am an individual who's worthy of your love, an actual person, not just something in the abstract. And so it is with God. He's an 'I' (or a personal individual), and so we love God, in an intimate personal way."" This may well be a valid way of using this particular word, yet it doesn't mean that it represents our own feelings. Rather, it may simply mean ""Love"" in a general sense. It may even be an attempt to use the word for the feeling (in the sense of a concept) itself, rather then as the thing that gives rise to feelings (a concept).
So, we begin to ask ourselves, ""What is this I that they're really talking here?""
But, before we do we should also ask, does using the term ""love"" (as a word) mean one thing to New Age authors and another to us? Or, are they talking the exact same ""concept""--and that means they"

A:
The first part of your question, 
Do I need any documentation for the identity check?
has the answer NO.
Your request,
""Do you need to send my driver's license (and maybe my passport / social security card)? It's all pretty straightforward. "" does not make sense.  How could it be straightforward? It is not straightforward to drive your car. You need a valid driver license for this. Same is true for your passport. How would it straightforward  for them to have your driver or your other two pieces of evidence? They would not want to take your documents in this case unless  you request it by sending them your two documents. So, the question is, why would they send you your three pieces  of documentation in  case you want it?  If they are in any way suspicious of you, they will require you for all of the paperwork and make you fill out all the forms by yourself."

1075,Is There Any Way To Verify Who I Am?,Considering this utterance: Is There Any Way To Verify Who I Am? What is the intent that best describes it?,"? The best explanation is: The question, ""is there any way to verify..."", expresses a belief, but only in the very vague sense that the question is about the ability of some agent to make a statement or action, by which some action or statement is meant that reveals the speaker or does something that can be used to identify them. So the best interpretation of the example as phrased is an expression of belief in some unspecified and perhaps impossible method of establishing or proving identity or some such claim.

What I want to focus attention on here is what you think a reasonable interpretation might be of:

I want you to consider a specific example of this, which I consider to be an important case in its own right. And so I'll begin with a bit of history: This phrase was uttered by King Ludwig II of Bavaria in 1886 shortly before his death. His father, Otto, had him poisoned while the King was in exile in Venice. Ludwig had written a book entitled ""The Secret of Death"" in which he explained that he wanted to commit suicide by drowning in a lake, and that this was his ""secret"". When he heard that his son had died, Ludwig said: ""this is his [my] name, as I have sworn."" The story goes further that Ludwig was convinced that there was a way in this secret that a man could prove his identity, that if someone knew this ""mystery"", they could use some special knowledge for the sake of which they would die. In an interview given about twenty years before he died he said, when someone asked him what the secret was: I can't tell you. But my dear, you'll have to die first. (Meyer, p. 17).
The phrase is also known in English as the last words of Ludwig, King of Italy. It is often quoted in discussions of life extension and immortality. One of these is in Richard Dawkins' book The Selfish Gene, where he says: You will have seen, if you look in my books, the words ""I am Ludwig of Saxe-Zerbst."" These words were written in 1883. I don't know exactly where they were spoken, or even how they came into my possession, for I haven't been told. Nor do"
