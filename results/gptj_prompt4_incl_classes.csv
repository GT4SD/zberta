0,i need to know your exchange rates,"['know rates', 'exchange rates', 'know rates']","{}\n Choose the most suitable intent based on the above utterance.\nOptions\n{}\n","choose rates and
exchange rate

I think I'm close but something is still incorrect in my approach. How would a native speaker go about solving this? Am I close?
What I tried is:
1. Get the intent from the start and check for the ""Exchange"" intent (intent 0).
2. If it is a ""Choose"" or ""Know"" case, I get and use the values in those cases. Else, the user asked for a price, and I check if that's the case. But that doesn't work because I need the rates in that case to calculate the price. 
3. I also tried to get all the possible values of 'rates' in the utterances, but then the problem is how to compare the 'chooses' with the ones that have rates. It gets even harder when we consider cases like 'exchanges rates' where the person will likely ask for 'rate from X to Y'.
Can you please help?   I think the logic is pretty simple, though I just can't figure it out. Thank you. :)  Please provide me a link to an example or a detailed explanation if you can, that would be much appreciated!
Thank you :)
P.S I've already looked at the other SO links that had this problem but I could not seem to make it work. This is my first post here, so please let me know if I violated any rules :) Thanks. Any help would really be appreciated. Thanks! :) :) THANKS SO MUCH!  :) This helped me so much! Thank You!

I don’t know where to find <thing> to buy. <intent>:
What is the price of <good>? <utterance> [context]

<utterances> can be in either of the following 2 formats:
utteration:intent: <context> 
Example - How do you order a coffee?   ask: How may I help you? (I want a cup of coffee and don't care how the coffee is made.)  choose:  Coffee order: Coffee (medium)
In the first scenario, a user could say ""How may i help"" followed by an intent ""order"" and a context. The bot would have to figure out that the user wants to make a request for something (order) and needs help in figuring out how.  Based on these 2 inputs ""may"" would be chosen as this is a question for the ""ask"" intent. ""i want coffee"" will be a ""tell"" since it is not a command (not ""what"").
If the second scenario is used, the system will have only context, and will select the utterances ""Coffee"" for asking for a thing (the question asked), and then the intent of ""coffee order"", the context being ""What"" to identify that this request must be for coffee, then a tell for ""how"" (to make sure to get a good cup), so ""medium"" is chosen (a size).
The utterations should contain the information needed to decide the correct intent for that utter, including all relevant contexts. For some utteraces you will need to look at more than 1 intent, or even for some intents more that one utter. In the later case, you can create multiple templates with the same intent name, as long as all the possible contexts are covered in a template. If the template doesn't cover all possibilities, this will trigger an exception. You can also add a catchall (or fallback) template to catch any utter that doesn‘t match any of your intet. There is an example of this in the documentation, in how to handle a non-matching utter if you choose the fall back option."

Rate

What is exchange
rate
(from the dictionary, 
)
The exchange (or foreign exchange) rate is a rate used to compare
the value and purchasing power of two currencies. The
purchasing power (PP) of a currency is determined by an exchange  rate,
which divides its purchasing money (value) by the price of
that money.  The exchange or foreign currency exchange rates are
typically quoted for a particular time period or to a  fixed date, such as 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days or 1
 year ahead. It is normally given in terms of the foreign
currency's value in relation to the U.S. dollar (USD) and expressed as
a fraction. A currency's exchange/exchangerate is an inverse of its
PP. For example, if the value of EUR in USD in 2012 is
1.20, one Euro is considered equal to USD 0.80, then the
EUR/USD = 1.2/0.8 =1 2.0, which is expressed in percent."

Are either of these the correct thing to do?  Are there any good resources on doing this sort of thing using python? Would appreciate any suggestions / pointers to resources!
Thanks!   I have a very poor command of Python and am just picking it up slowly as I work on this. It is not a homework assignment as much as a hobby. Sorry if this is too simple an issue for the stack! :)  Many good suggestions below and I'm going through them all. Thanks! I would like to make the model perform with 80-90% accuracy on my dataset, but the more I read the the closer I get to finding a model for this problem that works. So any advice there too would be appreciated. Again, thanks! :D
edit: I ended up using an nlp pipeline in a pre trained BERT based model to find the intents. This is an easy way to go if you have little data. However, I am finding the performance isn't that good. Any suggestions from the community there as to how good this method is would also be awesome. I will also keep updating this issue with any new findings or results I come by :)
Edit again:  After experimenting with the various nn based approaches (CNN, LSTM, etc.) I decided to try the BPE pipeline on BIO tagging (see below). This has worked out very well for me. The accuracy has improved by almost 10% and this has been enough for my purposes. As a bonus I didn't have to worry about the data sparseness problem or having to deal with tokenizing the string. :) Also, it is very fast. There were no issues with using the original BPMN 2.0 dataset to test out the classifier. Also in this case, the accuracy was close to 80% on average for all intented.

28,how do your exchange rates work?,"['exchange rates', 'work rates']","{}\n Choose the most suitable intent based on the above utterance.\nOptions\n{}\n","The first utterances work well with the option work rates. The rest of the utteraces are ambiguous. This results in the following ambiguity scores, which are the scores of each intent. In order to fix this, one needs to choose from the options. However, as you will learn in next question, this may not always be possible. For example, in a movie rental context, the user may say a price of 10 dollars for a 3 month subscription and ask for the rates per day. So if the system understands that the first intent is about rental rates rather than work, it should pick the third option as the correct option and the second and fourth options as alternatives. On the other hand, if it understands the intent as one for work hours only, or any of them, then they would all work equally well. How to decide on an appropriate set of utterace patterns? This is exactly the topic we’ll tackle in later questions. I‘ll use a simple example in this question:

Let„s say there are only two valid options, for example: the 3rd option or 4th option. We will not know what the users really wants to know. What can we do? We can first try to determine what we expect the answer to be (if possible).

Now, what would you expect a ‚‡ exchange‖ to tell you? In a sense you could say that a currency  exchange is the way you go from 1$ to another currency. 
If I were a user, I would expect an answer telling me how much 1€ is in 1$.

Foreign Exchange Rate
A foreign (or foreign) exchange (FEX) is a transaction between two different currencies. A FEX involves converting the foreign country’s currency into the national currency (i.e. U.S. Dollars into Euros) of a different country, and vice versa. It is often called ""foreign exchange market"" or ""forex"" in short. This transaction is denominated in two currencies, a base currency and a counter currency, which may differ between buyer and seller. For example, if the base (selling) currency was US Dollars and the counter currencies were Euros, the FEM can be denoted USD/EUR. Foreign exchange markets are open for buying one currency with another, for either long or short-term. These markets can operate in any currency unit of measure, although the USD is most commonly used as the underlying base unit."

But, what if the same user asks this question again, after waiting 2 minutes, should this new answer also be 4? I think it shouldn't, because it won't make sense, to say ""it was 4 since last time"". But the intent doesn't allow this, as it has only a question, not an options. That is why the ambiguity. If this intent is wrong, please suggest a correct one. Thank you. Hope this makes sense. :)
A sample code that will determine and answer for this would be much appreciated. Just a sample is enough. Thanks in advanced. :D
Edited2:  Added an answer based upon an Edit given by one of the users of this post. Added this in comments. Apologies for any ambiguity or misunderstanding. This was not the original intent. It can be found under ""Answer 1"". Thanks for your help. Have a nice day. -Javasoft
Answer 2: The utter is: Tell me what the current time is. The value returned should always be a number. There is nothing that can't be an utter (including a sentence) but the question only asks for a time, and the best answer will always contain"

Update 1:
As I mentioned in the comment, I tried to send text to alexa. But, as I used a custom card with a different color to get attention of aalea, it did not work. That's why I posted this in here. So, if any one knows why a word with different font color could not trigger a reaction of Alexa, please let us known. :(
For your information, the card is as follows. Sorry for the bad quality. :P

update 2:  the code I've used before sending custom response is correct. it worked very well. just that I had wrong card. that's all..

UPDATE: I have successfully made a new card for my skill and it's working good. The only issue I was having was Alexa not understanding ""I need your card please"" as a valid intent. Once I changed "" I need card "" from'I Need Card'to 'I Need Your Card ', it started to work good too. Now if anyone could tell me why that is, and if there's any documentation available, that would help.Thanks in advance. Any help is highly appreciated. Tq. Have a good day :-)  :) (I'm in Bangalore)

I've looked around at Google's examples and tried to figure out how to handle this but I haven't been able to find anything. The closest thing I found was this https://github.com/gatsbyjs/dialog-flow-starter-kit/blob/master/examples/nodejs.js
But I still don`t know how I need to build the actions. Should I have 2 actions? If so, what should they be, should I try to combine them into 1 action and have the same response?  Or does the response just return something? I tried that and I ended up sending back a message that the agent was offline, even though it wasn't. It was confusing at first to see it respond like that. What do you recommend? Is it okay if I use 2 separate actions, or it isn't best? Or maybe there is no way to do it without 2 or more actions in this case? Please help? Thanks. Please let me know what additional details I should add to help clarify what I am asking. :)
Update 1
So, after reading more about this I did some more research and found the example in https: //github.com  /Dialogflow/Dialog-Flow-Nodejs-SDK/tree/develop/samples, they have an example with 4 actions  and 2 intents, I didn't realize that it was possible to use more than one action for a single intent, but if so that's what needs to be created in my case, how do I create a ""multiple"" action?

Thanks in advance
I'm using Dialogflow and my training set and intents are all there (not the training data)
So what the intants are:   Date - Delivery - No delivery, Delivery date or Next delivery. The delivery has two different intant. One for when the item is available and the other one is when it isn't. In the case that the delivery date is past the current_date it should fall into the no delivery if it's not available. So it would go back to the Date intent to say if delivery is not on that date. If it is on then it'll fall to NextDelivery or it doesn't exist. Also the first intent is used because of a case when I say deliver it today. It should go to that intent but also to be able to handle the date of today + a date it won't deliver to me for today (example I want it to deliver today but the due date will be in a week. And I don't want a response of no date on week 1. I just want to go for the next delivery on Tuesday) The date part is because I will have a lot of things to do with the future and this will help me organize things and not make a mess of it. Like I said in an order for something I need to order it for a couple of months, so in that order, the intent Date will go from current date to next couple. That's why the IF is needed. For example: I order something that needs to arrive on May 10. Now this might be today, tomorrow, in 7 days, next week etc. so this is why I'm adding an IF to check if its the same as the actual date I got. Or if you just order tomorrow the order is made in May 11"

Receiving card. (You may say this sentence.)
The response of the application will be like this
   {

How to use? 
1. You may utter the following. 

  - You know how much you have to spend.

 - Please use 'I am using' if you know the card number. Or just 'Thank you.' if it is not you. It is just for example. If you are not sure how to utter this, please utter 'How long it will take until I receive the bill?' and then receive your card at this moment. This is the default answer. The application understands the current moment and will reply accordingly. But even if the answer is 'please wait', the user who has to wait will not be annoyed. Even if a response comes after some time, the'reception of card' will come sooner. How long you receive a card is up to you as it varies by each bank. So please try your best to choose a 'Receive' or 'Please wait' option. In any case, you will get a quick response. Please try to answer the questions like below. And please choose 'how much I must pay for?' if there is a specific amount you must spend, or simply choose something that you do not mind spending. Thank you for your understanding. Hope you enjoy using our app. :-)
2. For the other answer, it could be used in various cases. However, we will show a simple example here. We use the example of when a user has some money left over, and wants to give this money to friends. Suppose the bank does not have enough money when receiving the request. Since we know that some customers usually need money from their friends, this example is used. A user asks 'What is my balance?' or a friend asks the same and the customer will receive money. Let's use this case as an example for the intent called 'Give'. So the utterances of 'what is your current balance?', and 'is there a way to send money? (if it has a method) are examples of uttering a request to 'give' the money, which in this answer will respond with a message to the client. As for a reply"

I need to pay by card. Please give me your card details. 

For me this is the expected flow of an Intent:
1. I need X ->   I want to talk to you -> you need Y -> I would like to do something -> You want Z -> We both can do Y because of Z
2. Choose from options
3. You can have more than one option
And so on. This is how a conversation goes. The utterances I provided are just examples. They do not cover all the cases you can imagine to have. But in the end they should be as broad as needed so the model can be generalized and reused. For the sake of simplicity I will use just one utterment as example: ""I want my phone number""
My question is: How do I achieve this with the Google Speech to Text API?
What I do is first convert the audio to text:  Google::Cloud::Speech::V1::ListOperationsResponse speech_list_ops;
  google::LongRunningRequestBuilder builder(&speech_handler, &speech, std::chrono::seconds(5));
 builder->Build();
 while (speech.NextResults(3)) {//3 results
 std:string text;  std ::stringstream st; st << speech.results[0].alternatives[2].transcript << std :""\r\n"" ;
 text = st.str();

  text.erase(text.size() - 1,1);//removes the "".""

 std.string output = ""Your phone is ""+text+std:endl; stdout<<output;//output=Yourphoneis+555
}
The text I get is always: (555) 555-5555
So I know it is an issue related to encoding. Because I tried it with two different encoders: google-cloud-core-speech 1 and GoogleCloudSpeach1_beta. However they both give the same results. How can I encode this so that my request gets accepted and gives me the actual digits that I can use in a web service call? (I could then use them in my web application for further processing)

The following are the possible slots in utterances in
the JSON response: card. The card property can have one
or more slots. If no slots are present, a slot named card is
created. Card slots have no fixed schema. They may be used
to store any property of the card type that can be stored in an

body's own purposes; see Reserved Slots and Properties for an explanation)

A typical response would look like this:.

 ""text"": { ""language"": 'en-US',
""text"":"" I have 4 
cards on my account. ""},

 ""intent"":""use_card""
 }
You can also specify intent information in text. For example, the

The following example is a simple program using the Google Cloud Natural Language API. 
To get the natural language API working on your server, see the [Natural Language section of the documentation](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/)
In this example we use a web server to access the API, using Python. But in your own code you can create a Python client library from the client c-library. See the next example for creating a client. Once you have the c library, you will be able to read and write to the Cloud NLP API via the library as described [below](#python-code).
[![Build Status](http://g.twimg.url.co/profile_images/386489791/twitter-logo-v3_normal.png)](https:github.githubassets.io)
## Step 1. Create a natural-user-agent
Create a user agent header with the name `google-cloud-natural` set to something unique. This will allow you to know which request is being processed. You want unique name to avoid accidentally trying to handle one request with multiple users. We use the `Google/Cloud-NaturalLanguage` header in the below examples to refer to Google's client-server library for processing NaturalLanguage requests. The following code creates a google-service-account client which can be used to generate a unique user-AGENT-name for your requests to GCP. Make sure you are the owner of your GKE cluster. Otherwise, it can take 5+ days to become the GOOGLE_CLOUD_NATURAL_LANGUAGE_AGENTS_KEY_NAME owner and have your request honored. In the long run you want the key you create below to exist on a permanent basis on GCS as that is the only way your natural languages requests will succeed with your account. If you wish to delete this key when this guide is published you may wish too delete it after a few days.

I am trying to use this code to detect if a card is stolen by comparing the serial code with a set value. However I can not get this program to run. Is this the proper method or is there an easier way? If so, could someone provide a link? Thanks in advance!  I am very new to programming if anyone needs clarification please ask. :)
Edit: I want to be able to tell if the user stole the card. I do this by using an online card database which I use to check the serials numbers, and if there is a match I will alert the police or do some sort of action. The code works if you manually enter the number, but I really want this to work with just saying  ""stole card"", because people are not going to read the code. Thanks again! :)  The only thing that might help is, if I could get an error to throw. If I get something like illegal character I know what is wrong. Please let me know if any other code is needed and where I was going wrong?
Also: This is not homework I need to submit this for our programming group. It is to learn. ;)
EDIT: Thank you all! The following code does work for me. All of you helped me learn a lot! Thank again for your help! This was my first real assignment, so this was a big help.

What i tried to do was using the utterace ""i lost my ATM card"" and using a slot named ""stealing"" to detect the ""intent"". But it doesnt seem to work. How should i get my idea to succeed? Do i need to write a custom slot? How can i do it? What is the code for it??
I am writing it all in python but that doesnt really matter. I am really stuck here. If anyone can help me that would be really great! Thanks!
EDIT:
Thanks to jay-man, it seems to me the best approach will be to create a new slot. For me its a simple python script. This is what i did for my utteraces. The utteracce i tested is ""the card has been stolen"" or the ones like ""my card is lost"". I want to test the following: if the card was stolen, I can report, if not I would like to inform the ATM of the incident to see what they can do. So i created a python function and then a script that will check if a card (in an inventory or a wallet or whatever i define) has an attribute named steal. Here is my code:   -  I didnt test this because the script just runs when i run it with the debug option on and my phone freezes. Anyway here it goes: -
if __name__ == '__main__':
  test_function(""Card"", [""card_has_att""])
If that is not the way to go, then i dont know, but i would appreciate if anyone could suggest a solution, because i will do research and see if i can make something else. Thank you all for taking the time to answer my question. :)

  (Intent):  I don't know this, but the name of the intent is stolen.  It can be:

 get me a new card

 (Activity): {name:get a card}

 You might want to handle the case where the user just wants to report that an existing card has been stolen as an intent named reportcard. It would then be mapped to (activity):{name:{type:report,name:'card is reported as stolen'}}."
155,somebody has stolen my card i need help please,"['need help', 'need help']","{}\n Choose the most suitable intent based on the above utterance.\nOptions\n{}\n","please help me

This is the example utterances, i just used this, and the question is ""Who has the card?""
Please, try to use the options you think can help, or suggest some better options
I have the following choices, but I am not sure which is correct:
1. need_help
2. please_do_it
3. can_you
4. i_have_the_card
5.???????
6. who_has_my_cards 
Which one is right? I tried using the one's that were most like my question,
but I think I messed something up
The right answer should be the option that is most similar to what I actually said in the original question
Thank you a lot for your help!
Here's the questions from the quiz
Hi, which of the choices are right. Can you help with the explanations?
(1) I have lost the key for my bedroom window
_________________________________________
You would use “lost”
“key’s.‘ I need to find
your key and open the window. You
would use: need, have, to
find, lost
Explanation: I will need
a key to open your bedroom
window. I know you have a key. It is
lost. So I must ask
someone else for help. That makes no
sense. ‘
_____________________________________________________________________
What‹'
Your card
is
stolen
and you need a new one. you
could use; need; have to replace;
to get a
new
card, please; stole; lost; is stolen; needs; to steal; be stolen _______________________________________________________________________
Write the answer below. (2)
A _____ is a type of
key
B a ____
C an ID
D a card _______________________________________ ______________________
Why would we use a D? This is wrong. A key is used to lock/ unlock a door. Your card is to unlock the door and is not the type that a ID is. B is too vague. C has no meaning in this question. D is better for the meaning you want to express in your answer.____________________________________ (3) Which of these is NOT the
most suitable"
156,i cannot find my credit card,"['find card', 'credit card', 'find card']","{}\n Choose the most suitable intent based on the above utterance.\nOptions\n{}\n","card

157,are you able to locate my card?,"['locate card', 'locate card']","{}\n Choose the most suitable intent based on the above utterance.\nOptions\n{}\n","find card with id

Find the nearest restaurant

A:
   The utterances are stored in the dictionary named ""dictionary"". In your example the input is ""Find my phone."" You can use the string.split("" "") method on a string and then use that method to get all the possible utterable strings of the phone. I don't want to go into too much detail right now because I am not good at explaining things clearly. You should be able use string functions to find the utterables. 
The following code works for me, but it may not work for you. The code uses the Python programming language to search for the strings from a list of utteribles in a sentence. If I were you I would try the find utterible part of it because it does a lot of stuff for us and I think the best way to learn something new is to do the stuff yourself.

  d = {""located"" : [""I found your phone."", ""The phone was found by me""], ""find""  :  [""The card I need was located by my coworker.]""}
def find_utterance(sentence):  #  Input sentence contains an uttering in it!  This utterling has to be a noun. We can't use verbs. For example ""I need the card.""
s = sentence
# Get the words from the sentence and turn them into a List  using ""split""
words = list(s.lower().split())
print (list(d.keys()))
for word in words:  ## For each word that is in our sentence, we check to see if it exists in dictionary or not. This part does it. Then we do another for loop to check each utterition in this word and the entire sentence to make sure there are no other utterings. It returns a true if there is anything else in there to look for. After all this we return the name of our chosen utter, which I believe in your case is called ""locating"" and we have to return that. But we also have a return false value because if we can not find anything then we will return nothing. So that's why I say you have that return. At the end we use a bool so when we call the method it will look like a method. That will make things"

When you have a training dataset of a large number of examples you may find a neural architecture such as a RNN with an output layer can work.

EDIT:-
So the answer is to use let (string : string) = child.Child as! String. That means it requires a string, but in my case its an intent. Also the syntax is wrong. But the correct way is let Intent(packageContext, Child.name)

You don't need to write a sentence for the first intent, but if the second intent is a question, you might write an answer based off the information in the question.

age3 (note: all 3 are optional) or choose any of the three (only the first 3 can be optional). I do have the list of all the possible options available.  The age should not be a part of a choice and is therefore required. I will need to handle this in the parser - this is just a simplified example. Any help on"

What is a minimum of age in the context of opening an investment account (bank account), and what is minimum in this context. It is in a dictionary.

**EDIT**
My understanding of what Alexa is capable of is that, given a specific utter, it will determine the intent that is most likely associated with that utter text. For example, if my utter is, ""What's the weather today?"" then according to what I learned from Alexa, the system will try to match it with the utter ""Weather"" intent, which has a confidence score of.96 according the documentation. The same thing happens for ""Tell me a joke"". In the case of a match, Alexa says """

Forgot to mention this is going to be a Node.js project.  I've been playing with Jest. It seems to work as I would have expected it to. What about Enzyme? It's pretty good for unit testing React, does it also work with Nodejs? Is it a pain setting it up?  Thanks!  It looks very promising. I might even try it over JUnit
Thanks for the help so far,  @jamesh
Also for future posters, JEST is pretty well documented on their site
https://jestjs.io/docs/en
Edit 2
The way I see it, there are two ways to approach this:  Either you can just do a bunch of unit tests, then you end up with too many tests that are not very good because you do too much work for too little output. Or, you just run the JADE file and then check the JSON output of it. JUst run node index.jas will run your tests. Also it will check your imports, and that you have the correct imports. If you follow the jade docs this will tell you how to set it all up. https://www.jadesoftware.com/documentation/jas-cli

You should write the intent as a verb, i.e. ‘open daughter‘, not 'open an accout'. This helps to make the natural language processing better, if the data is not in human language.

How will this work? I am a bit lost at this point. Should I just make a decision and start training from scratch? Or what?   I think one of the answers should be that you have to decide how you want to use it before it is used on its own.  For example:

I will open my account at <bank>.
  The bot will reply  ""What will you name your account?""
""Hello, I will name this account '<name>.'""
 ""Will this new bank help me with saving money?""  (or)
The bot is going to add this bank account to your list of banks. How will the bot be able to do this when you haven't yet told it about all your banks and their account's names? That is how it works. It asks how, when it has nothing to put into the ""new account"" box. Then it makes a simple decision about opening the account and then opens it. If your intent is ""How do I add a bank to my list?"" then the dialog should work. This works because you can see what the question is asking the chatbot. You are not just going in blind and just assuming it can read your mind. The chat is actually asking about a specific concept of account, ""a bank"" is not a generic term that applies to any type of bank it doesn't know anything about so it asks. In the end your bot could just say whatever and if you think it's a good bot you'd just have a list with your accounts and you could have it add them or change them. But the user asked ""how do you add the new Bank to the list"", and since you said you wanted the bank you'll be adding, and it knows what type. So it will ask, it wants to know how to find this thing. ""It can't be too difficult, if it was just a name I could find out easily"". So the answer to this question should give it the information to get to that step. Maybe it'll want the name of a branch, or some other parameter. When the questions start to feel too vague the conversation just stops and a warning pops up. Hope this makes sense. Good luck with the project."

If you want to access the web service directly, you can add the action:service.dialogflow_v2beta1 to your web hook and call it directly. To use it, your action must be configured to receive HTTP POST requests. See the Webhooks section for more information. For example, to handle an email message, a web server would call a URL like this: https://{your_website}.
For example:
{
  ""contexts"": [...]
""intents"": [

],

To handle the HTTP event, add an HTTP_event_type to the response JSON for the context, with a name matching the event name you chose. 
Example: if we receive the request for ""sendMessage"" and choose the send_message intent, the body of the json response will contain an object:   {
 ""event"": {  // event

How much of this sentence should I use? For example:
""I don't have any credit card"", ""I can't open a credit account"", etc.?

A:

 You can use the following to find the right answer in your case.  

 - Open account : A person can not take up the account. But he can create an Account. Like a bank Account, a savings account, or any other type of account for that matter where a person donates his money.

  A bank account is considered as an type account where you can save a certain amount of money to withdraw after a specific period of time. This specific amount is called a Savings or a Withdrawal limit. So a Bank Account can be opened by a Person with a fixed amount. For eg:- A Person opens a Credit card Account and the limit is Rs 500. If the person withdraws Rs 600 he will be charged interest in accordance with the prevailing rate. That is, the interest will charge according to how much the card is used and also how old the Card is. Now a card with 5 years of age does not charge the same interest as it does a 2 years old card. Similarly, interest charged on a Card does NOT depend on its age. Interest can change over the years. It all depends on how many transactions the customer makes. A card which is open for a very long time doesn't get charged an interest at all if he doesn’t use it and if the transaction is made at a branch. When the balance is more than Rs. 10,000, an Annual Maintenance Fee is charged. The fee is applicable on all such cards. Also, at the end of the term, one can redeem all his balance in one go and that amount will NOT include the annual maintenance fee. However, if any balance on his card exceeds the mentioned limit, then he/she will have to pay in advance all the amount to be withdrawn. Once that limit has crossed, all money will not be credited back to the Account at one time, but as and when he makes a transaction, he gets the benefit of that. He will need to get an advance amount at least 30 days before his scheduled repayment. After that he may withdraw the required amount from a different part of his bank (which may be the ATM or other branch)."

You can use:

stopGeofence : To stop tracking and stop the location services. This API is only usable when you set an intent filter as a geo-fence. In this case, the app that uses the geofencing APIs will have to specify the ""request"" intent. For example, if you want your app to be notified when a user enters your own private area, your intent must be set as ""Geopost"". If you use ""getLastKnownLocation"", the last location that you provided for that is sent. When the user changes this location, it is no longer sent for further location updates.

A:
  How many times do I have try to? 
This is a typical dialogue, with a question of quantity. This will be answered with many, because there is always more than one. If you asked, ""How many pins do you have?"" It's likely they say, “I have one pin”, and the correct response would be ‘how much?’.  If they asked ” How would you like it? ’, the response could be, I would like one piece. Or, a simple no would probably do. There are lots and lots of possibilities, but I think it would not be possible to list them all, as there are too many variations and too few samples for the data to be representative of a large range of variation.

 not using card 

not using phone 

 The card has not been set up and is not available for use.  This option only applies if the user has a physical card in their possession. This is typically the case when the physical device is inserted in a mobile or landline telephone. When a card is being used, the dialog will continue and the device will be configured if it is already on. If it has been configured but is currently not responding, then there will only be a single option. Otherwise, if a device does not have a PIN associated with it, this option will still be shown if there is nothing else in the prompt list. The prompt can be set in advance in Setup > General > Language and locale. In this case, there can sometimes be two options, depending on where the phone is. For a list of available options see the Intents.md. page. [#f1b4b9]. If the caller is asked for a phone number, a number will not be displayed, but instead the option ""Enter phone"" will display. However, since the voice recognition may not detect ""phone"", depending where in Canada the call was attempted, ""not available on this handset"" and ""use phone card"" may be the correct and most specific option for some regions and devices. See below for further explanation. (See also Not using the mobile. #f8cdd3)
 Using phone
The user requests an action which is performed over the network using a cell phone. Using this prompt, you can ask the person on your phone to do anything such as call 911 or dial the home number on their cell. It will always show up as Not on Device and will use the default phone app on whatever phone it was called from. Use Phone can only work if you are on a WiFi/Bluetooth network for voice. Voice will typically only operate in voice calls (e.g. not when an email is received) and may need to be explicitly enabled by the owner of the SIM. Some carriers can turn off the data for calls while the number is out roaming (for free), which will block some apps from using these prompts. To ensure Voice prompts can work on non-WiFi networks, use Voice in an app that does support WiFi or use a different"

The pin is used to protect the user by enabling them to sign transactions. For a list of available intents to choose from, you can look them up on developer.salesforce.com/docs

  For example, this intent can be used when you want to block the number ""555-555"".


You can choose to call this API with one of the following query parameters to filter your results.

 objectType — The object type whose objects you wish to see. A value of ""sObject"" is an alias of sObjectType and always refers to a single sObjec type, while a value such as ""Contact"" refers a set of object types. 
 objectId — An ID for the object. If there is just one object with the specified ID, the API returns all the fields of that single object, including those in the `CustomFieldSet` sobject, as JSON. By using this method to return just that one record, a more efficient call is possible. You can use the sforce-object-api to query for all related custom settings for a field. When you use an API to read a record for only the custom fields and not the rest of attributes, such custom objects as `Picklist`, `Multi-Select Picklist` are also queried. To do so, pass null for any fields that you are not interested in (e.g. `custom_field_set__c`). To return values in all custom object fields, leave this value null. Otherwise, specify a valid field name to limit the data returned to that field (for a full explanation, see the developer documentation). If object has no related objects, error is returned. Read more about query filters. See query
 fieldSets — A list containing the field set information for each custom field to include in each returned custom record. Use this to only retrieve custom values or custom setting for individual fields (rather than all). Specifying null will retrieve all values for that object's fields.

Intent Detection
After getting the intent detection model we need to train it, and in the end we can save it as well. We do this by calling the following class methods. It also shows how to get the response after training. Once you get responses, you can also print those responses to check if they are appropriate and what is the best response. You can see below that we are getting all the blocks and also what blocks are we getting

 int _intents_number = 4 ;

I'm using Speech Recognition as described here: RecognizeSpeech and it works. I use an IntentHandler to recognize the utterances that I want it to take action on. But for some reason if the user says ""unblock"" the wrong intent is chosen (pins).
In case it's relevant I also have a Google Voice Actions and a Voice Search feature. The voice recognition works well and when I say ""google home"" I am taken to Google Home. It also works for the ""googler home"". Google says they can't do what I'm ask about but they are happy to send me an answer, which I then put into the app. 
Here's my code for both the Google Assistant and the Speech recognition:
// Get access to all the activities in the google app
ActivityManager manager = (ActivityManger) this.getSystemService(ACTIVITY_SERVICE);
AppOpsManager ops =
   (AppOpManager) getSystemServic(Contexts.APP_OPS_PREFIX);

  ops.checkOp(AppConstants.MY_APP, AppConstans.CHECK_WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE,

 - do pin will get the pin code from user and ask for permission which will lead to user being blocked and will show message like ""you need to login"".
- if user gives wrong answer then it will just end the program. No further action will be taken.  I want to end this program with further actions in case answer is incorrect (e.g: user will have to give correct answer to pin and then the application will ask to the user to grant or deny permission for access).

There's a lot of ambiguity with the utterances here.  You can't just say, ""What are work ideas?""
If you're not asking for a question, but a single answer, then ""work"" means ""job"" - so maybe ""what are the job ideas"".  
But if you want a list of things, you should use an ""open-ended"" question like ""Who or what is a work idea?"" or ""Which/how many work-ideas?"". This gives context for the ""list"" of answers, so that when the answer is ""I'm not sure, ask me later"", it will be more useful to you."

Edit 1: The card is from an institution, and they only issue it for a short time until the end of the month, so it's very rare i have an issue, but it is frustrating, especially as I never had an issuers before and it doesn't tell me anything more than it did with the card i previously had
Solved:
The problem was that the token was not connected to their online system, as it turned out

I tried this but did not match
""I have a new Paytm account.""

 ""I made a successful payment. Please, let me know the result?""
OR
How do I do an intent matching for this:
What I am trying to match here is, if the user says, I have an Android, they can select the intent contact and get the payment successful. If not, the second intent will match, in case they are saying they have IOS. 
In which case the code flow will go to the contact contact intent
But if they don't specify the phone and just says  contact, the first or the ""What's your phone"" intent, will show. That's what I'm struggling to find. I can only find the if -then scenarios and it only goes one or another. Thanks in advance. (If someone can find a similar question, can you please tag it with Android and Google)
The intent code is the following:   (The if else part is in parenthesis, where I want to check if it's Android or not but it does not have to be)  I've changed the intents to ids just to avoid confusion. It's still the same thing. This is one code, and is called when the dialog opens. So, there is no need to have if/else, just the single intent flow (it will be shown if that if is true):
  @Override
// TODO: Rename method, update argument and hook method pointers

thanks
this is how it's looking

if I could see this and it will help. it would be great
I was in a similar problem but not the same as this one. this is because this time they didn't accept my request. when I asked them to choose the intent, I thought that they will choose my intent. but instead the other intent is chosen. here what they said
""I would suggest that you send this as email. If you use the phone, make sure that the person who receives the email can read it. Then they can tell you more about the issue."" so that's why I was confused. they never used that intent and that‘s why it happened
and thank you. for your answers
Update
ok I'm very sorry that I didn“t explain it properly. in this case, as I can see the user is not in the correct flow and is in an unusual case. the case is that he was not able to select any intent but the system chose to send the message automatically so this system thought he wanted to cancel the action but he didn""t. then what I understand that it”s because he is using this action with a device that does not support this. and the response is from the device so he can‟t send anything. So I‒d just like you to let me know how do I check which device he„s using to complete the intended action. how can I identify this device? if I knew this I think I don›t need to say much about canceling that action
that‡s it

253,why wouldn't the contactless payment work when i tried to pay at the bus today?,"['contactless payment', 'pay today']","{}\n Choose the most suitable intent based on the above utterance.\nOptions\n{}\n","pay for this trip

A:
""Why didn't it work?"" is a question that can only be asked after you've found out whether or not it did work.  This means that we have to start with the utterances: ""it didn”t work"" and ""the ticket didn""t get paid"".  Then we can look more generally at ""why didn,"" and so on and find that ""don"" means ""not.""  So we get ""if the ticket wasn't paid, why didn it"" work?  Now, ""work"" can have multiple senses. The first one is ""to function,"" so we may say ""If the computer doesn't start up, then it doesn"" t work."" The other meaning is more specific: it can be an action word that has an agent, and that agent can perform some operation. Then ""didn"" has a similar meaning: an indirect object. In this context we could replace it with 'it', and the sentence would mean ""It's not the agent or the target of the operator that doesn work, but the system itself."""

For the first question (what is enable pay intent) there is no intent in the Watson API as it is not one of the predefined intents. The best approach would be to ask your users what they want to pay for. You can then ask them the question ""what do you want me to do?"", and then depending on what response you get use the appropriate response for that specific response."

What confuses me is what if the user actually says something more explicit like ""Can you top me up"" or ""I want to top you up. How much do I need to transfer?"".
Would I be correct to assume the following:
If it is ""can you topping me"" it means ""transfer for me""?
or  If it it ""top me you""  it means "" top for this amount?""
Also if I say ""How much top do i need?"", would that be ""how much topping do you(transfer)?"" which I find really hard to understand if to "" you "" means transfer. I feel like there is a much simpler explanation to this but my brain can not seem to grasp the concept right now

The following options are the possible choices for the command you need. 
(Note: I have given the example in Swift, as you mentioned Swift in your question)
Option 1: Use a custom Dialog
Create a Custom Dialogs for handling the ""transfer"" Dialogy: (Use Option 2 if your requirement is to use existing Dialogen)   (Refer the Dialogn's below link for more information )
https://github.com/facebook/react-native-ios/blob/f8f2d6e4a9b1fcf2b2f7d9f0cec1d2fb9aac1bd4/Examples/Components/Dialogs/CustomDialogSample/ViewController.swift#L20

//Do your logic here, based upon the text in textfield (Textfield must have a text).
return true
}
dialogref.presentFromRootView Controller()
 }
In your scenario, use the following code: 

 startTransfer(""Will you come to my house to make food"", text: yourTextField.text) //Pass the value of the your text field to the function
This example of using a modal dialog is just showing how to create your Modal Dialogie and not use a dialog from the app. Also, this example doesn't take in to consideration a multi choice selection. (which is an option you might want to explore if you want your dialog to be multi choiose) If you do require a Multichoice select option, you will need to do some changes in the functions below:

 Option2: Using a Dialom which is built within the Facebook sdk
You can use any of Facebook built in Dialoms that is already built with react-navigation. For more details, Refer the link: https://reactnavigationsample.gitlab.io/Getting-Started/dialogs.html#using-dialogn  In the scenario mentioned here you would need something to look like:"

 Choose an appropriate response from the given options.  

 1.Will there any money collected? 2.Not all of them will get charged 3.None  4.All of the money will collected  5.I did not get 10$
  Option 1 is incorrect. Choose another option. Option 2 is also  incorrect
The correct option is 4
Please explain why the answer  is given to be correct. The question is not about why is the option correct but how it is arrived.The answer could have been the first one. But since the options are given in a different way it shouldnt have given the  first answer. Hence the response is wrong
Can you tell me how this answer arrived as the correct answer
This is one example, there are other options, some are wrong. We cannot just blindly say answer as 1 2 3 4 5 is right.We would need to check why it has given that answer in this case
What would you do? Why do you think so? What can be the other possible  correct options? How do we arrive at the right answer? Please try to solve and share the reasoning. If we cannot arrive to the final correct one then its fine
Now I need some hint to understand the reason
In case of options such as:  2  3  or 5  the answers are correct without  any difficulty
So what I feel is
1
2
3
4
5
and so on are the responses based only on context and not by understanding the sentence? Is that possible? If yes, then how do I arrive there? I guess we have to study the wordings of different options in order to arrive the desired answer,  right? Can you point me to some material which explains the way to proceed?

P.S
Using the google search bar when I search for'substitute keywords' I only get results for substituing the entity with an intents 'intents' entity. This isn't what I want to achieve. What I actually want is to know how do I substitute a keyword with something else in Intent or Entity in Google Dialoque. So how can i change the syntax of:  card:""transfer"" to card:{transfer}?

I think this is not an correct definition. So I searched more on Google. As I found, there is more than one meanings for it and I'm not sure about the correct one. Please advise me. Thanks. Any help is appreciated. Thank you. Sorry if I made any mistake. My English isn't native. Here is an example from one of my dictionar:
Transfer: to convey (a person, money, possession, etc.) from place to place or from person to person. “The children will be transferred to the hospital.”
Fund: money or a sum of money. [informal]   ”I've received $300 for our family. - We had transferred $500 of her savings to our account. / The new system should be implemented by transferring money over to new banking systems. We transferred some of our money to that person.""  Source. (Dictionary.com)
Thank you for looking at my question. It may seem like a duplicate but none of them answered me correctly. The answer may be the same as above. Or it may not be and may have a different meaning. That's why I asked it here. All suggestions are welcome. If you know more about this and please tell me about that. :)  Please help me to figure out the exact meaning for this expression. In particular I have trouble with the noun and that's the reason why this question is asked. Many thanks. :).
Sorry for my low English. English is my second language. Forgive my grammar and syntax mistakes. Hope some professional helps me with it if you find them. :("

I mean I do not know what top means from the english. There will always be top in this case!  So can someone explain what does it mean and if it can be set to false. Thank you. :)
The second intent works for limit. We are limiting something with this intent. But if this is true for all, what should be used?  I did not understand this part. Why not use top?

Option: limit. Use `top`, to specify the amount of money you’d like to spend. It's an integer, and the minimum amount is 0. The maximum amount (the limit) is 100 (10,000). You can only top your current balance up to the limit you specified. For example, if your balance is $5 and you specify a limit of 3 dollars, the system will only let you top it up by $3 or less. You may also use the optional `$` symbol to make the value after the symbol explicit, e.g. if you say `stop` with $20, you won‘t be allowed to continue spending more, because the `limit` is reached and only $10 is allowed."

So basically my questions are,
what is correct use for ""top ups"" (in the sense of 'put something into it') or ""tell limits"" etc. in this sentence

  <Data type= “topups’ />

 <Intento  intentType= ""android.intent.category.DEFAULT""/>
 </Intents> 

 (2)  I have a list that I want  to choose from. So I can say that  topups are the only thing that should be allowed to be chosen. But how can I limit the choices for a set and still allow multiple items? Say I get an intent, with data.type='topup'; and data contains the following: '100$10', '150$15', etc...
 (3) I might have many options to chose from so i don  want to make the user choose an  option. For example if he says "" I'll pay"" what option in my case is the  valid one? The only one that comes to my head is 'I'll put 100 bucks' but  what others are there? Can i have multiple types for one choice and if so, what are those types of choices? For instance 'Put $10' and'put $20', or 'Pay $x', is this possible? So is it even possible to create such a  system? Should i do it all in java? If so how should this be done? And if not, how  am I gonna do this? Thanks

361,how do you get a virtual card?,"['get card', 'virtual card', 'get card']","{}\n Choose the most suitable intent based on the above utterance.\nOptions\n{}\n","create virtual

A:
The first step should be to create an intent, then you just use the Dialogflow API to execute it. The dialogflow service is free, but you still have to purchase the intents. Dialogs use their own format of intetns, and you can also use your own if you want. You can find the documentation here: https://dialogflowsolutions.com/intents/dialogs-developer-guide/
As for how to get the virtual cards. That is not something that DialogoFlow does out of the box because they don't do speech recognition. If you have the intent that you made above, you simply pass in one of those options to the API, like so: 
https://api.dialogue.ai/v1/apps/{app-id-or-name}/slots/slot-names/virtual/card?intentName=your-intent-here&languageCode=en-us&virtualCard={card-code-you-made-for-the-card}"
362,where can i find a virtual card?,"['find card', 'virtual card', 'find card']","{}\n Choose the most suitable intent based on the above utterance.\nOptions\n{}\n","find all cards

A:
The following sample app shows a basic use case for the speech recognition module. You can use the Google Speech Recognition API or Amazon's AWS Lex service to make your own implementation. I recommend using the SpeechRecognitionUtterance class as the first step in your application. It exposes the following methods for use in the intent handling: 
  @Override
public List<Intent> getUtts(List<? extends Utterances> utterances) {
 //...
return utterances.stream()
.map(utterance -> new SpeechUtters())
.filter(utt -> utt.hasUtternaise(""card""))
// use SpeechRequestUttermens or another mechanism to access the Utternance
 }
}
class SpeechUrtterant {...
UttenantUtteraue;
String text;//the text that needs to be parsed
boolean hasUtterness(String value)
{
if(value!= null)  //use the string as an Uttenance string
 return true; // if it was not empty, it had a utterns
else if(TextUtteancesUttaueur!=null) // use TextUttes as Uttermances
 { return Textutteantes.contains(text); }  

  else return false;  } }"

A:
There is no such thing as a 'virtual card' and I'd suggest you get clarification from the developers of the underlying APIs you are using. For example, I have no idea why 'get' cards are mentioned in the documentation for 'Virtual Cards', but not mentioned for other intent types. 
If you have a Card object, there are many useful helper functions for interacting with the card in a programmatic manner, such as get. If you want to use a card object in an intent, it would be useful to know if the intent supports a particular card so that you can use those helper methods."

a want (something) + (N or N-Form of BE)
""to want to""   (transitive):
  ""I want a big house.""
(intransitive) ""to wish to"".  This is not a transitive verb.  It is intransitive because it does not involve any movement, although there may be indirect movement. It means that the speaker is aware, at least, that there is some desired object, and that they feel some desire about that object: ""He wants to leave now.""  There's some movement involved in the sentence ""They want us to help."" but it is much more indirect: The listener is already aware of the situation, so their wish is for us (the listener's side) to act. In your case the object of want is just ""virtual card."" (There's no such object in your sentence).
What I am suggesting is that you think about what objects you may want, either for yourself or for others. You may just be using the noun form of ""want"" in its intrumental senses to ask about things or people that would interest you. I do this all the time; it helps me to get to know people better and find out about their lives. For example, suppose I'm at a party and someone asks if I want something to drink. If you ask ""Do you want anything?"" they may have just a few things that interest them, or it might be all their interests. But ""do you (want)"" gives you a choice to limit the options to a small number. ""You (have) nothing I don't want,"" and ""What can I give you that I know you will like?""
If you do want more specific details, you are probably asking for a card. Cards can be virtual (on your desktop) or physical (in that person's hand). It sounds to me like what you really want are a ""playable card game"" (which are the physical cards), and possibly a virtual card, such as a video game or an online game where one could play against someone in this game."

In the docs there is an info page about how to train a model. You can use the same info from the training and the dev examples to guide how you train your new model, if you are stuck."

If the answer is yes in both cases, then how can it be done? I was able to read the text file in Java, but how would I pass the information to a bot server? Is there a method provided by the SDK? If so, how to use it? Or is the only way by saving it in an external text-file and reading it at run-time? But then what kind of server should be used to send the requests to? A web-server or a desktop app server with a message server. If the second option is right, what do I need to learn in this direction? How to configure the server and how do i call the API of it from a Java program? Any resources would be appreciated. Thanks. I am using the Amazon Echo for my research.   I did not understand how they did it. They said to write an intent and it's action but in which format and what's the difference between an utter and intent? The example is for ""Open Amazon Alexa"". But how are they generating their data? Are they saving some data in a text files? And how did they convert them into a format? Please clarify. Thank you. And one more thing. Is it possible to add your own data to it(i.e. user defined data)?  Any reference links would also be of great help.Thank you,  A  student
I have been trying to figure out what they were using to produce data, and the best answer so far I found is that they used a database system to save the context and their training data and that is read during their run. The training is done by using some kindling words, intents, labels, context. In their article they have also mentioned to make a class for every intent that you have, like this: class openAlexa
Now the problem that has been there, is how the system understands a specific word if the training contains a sentence like ""Alex is a good friend. "" So I tried to understand their system and found out that the ""good"" and"

387,why do i not have a virtual card,"['have card', 'virtual card', 'have card']","{}\n Choose the most suitable intent based on the above utterance.\nOptions\n{}\n","I can not use both virtual and have card at same time
How can I know which intent best fits my uttering?

A:
""have"" and ""Card(s) on me"" are almost always used in different situations. ""Have"" is used to express possession, and the object could be a single object (person or place) or multiple identical objects (car(ies), airplane(planes) in the plural,...) 
In your example, you use ""have "" when you want your listener to understand that the ""card"" in your sentence is a physical card, not a software card. You also can't put a card and a phone in one hand at the same moment (maybe you mean, for example: ""Please have my phone and my card"").
This is how you would use virtual/have cards:"
388,how do i order a virtual card?,"['order card', 'virtual card', 'order card']","{}\n Choose the most suitable intent based on the above utterance.\nOptions\n{}\n","Example
Say the user says the followings:
i want to order my favorite pizza please
1   i want my pizza with pepperoni and onions
2  my phone is not working
3  give me a pizza box
4  how many pepperonis and how much onions you want? 
After the utterances were passed to intent handler, I found 3 of them are the same. so i decide to create intent for 3 questions with different labels like this: order-card-1 and order:card
In the question 3, the answer is just a question like how you can see in the code: question:give me pizza, what is your favorite food in pizza? so I create a new label: ask-for-order-pizza. but when I add it to the intent, it just shows ""order is unavailable"", and no response.  Is there something wrong with my model or the flow? I don't have any clue. Please help. I am pretty new to Alexa. If this is a beginner question, please let me know. Thanks a lot!
Update 1
I added a response when asking the what's my favourite food. But when i type the next utterence like: give a box to me, how to handle it? It just keeps on giving the ""Order is Unavailable"" message. Here is the updated flow:  https://www.screencast.com/t/ZKzZztX

Here is how i handle different utteraces. What I can think of is that the response from utterace 3 is wrong. Because it's asking for a value for the number of onions. It should be something like question= i have $value_of_pepperoni in $amount_in_onion_s"

I accept my own cards everywhere.   - This one might be a statement that you make, so the only way to know if it is true or not, will be to ask a human being directly. If someone accepts your cards as being valid, and you accept it from them, it should be considered true for you, otherwise, you will have to check the actual rules for each jurisdiction individually. Some places, they might also want your contact information, if you want to receive more. As you said, the same goes for the US, Canada, etc. So, again, check with the government, before saying yes.

This intent is used when the user wants to make use of an stolen credit card. In case of any kind of theft the police should be notified.

 

find my credit cards:
 Find Credit Cards: User is interested to get the lost credit/ debit cards. It is a kind which can be used to find the cards or can help the credit company to track the missing card holder. If the stolen card is recovered the intent will be cancelled. And there is no need to sue credit or debit card, so we need not choose this option and it might result in a negative prediction. 

 sue card my bank:

 Use Card to Send Money: If a card owner wants that other card to send it money for some reasons. That is the best option for this type. But this intent can only be triggered when your card has already been used for fraud. So it's better to use other type of utterances or you can also use a separate intent and combine both the utterings to create a new intent. There are chances that card may also be recovered, but not always. Then we should choose ""Use Card"".
   Use a Phone with Cash:  This is an additional intent that is specific to this utteranced. The user may use the phone to withdraw some cash from the bank account or he may ask the operator to charge some money. For example: Operator - “How can I make a call?”. User - ""Suspend the call"". Operator – ""Yes sir, how can you make this call?""User- ""use the mobile with cash"". It could be a part of a bigger flow of which the main flow is to ""find My Credit Card.""  The intent ""suspend call"" is also used as a response for the ""Find Card"" intent

 find credit: (not used in sample utteration of Find card)
 If you would like to cancel the flow, you may stop it by typing the ‘Stop’ intent (see the Cancel flow sample).
 To go back to the initial flow you need a ’Go‘ intent

""Choose the least suitable one"" is also a possible solution (for this task only).
What this means is that you are asking the intent to return the utterances with the minimum number of false positives (ie the card that it will accept) in the following scenario:"

Thanks so much in advance. Also is there a list of all possible intents that my bot could potentially reply with and if the bot has to choose from what options is it choosing? I would like more details on this. 
I'm sorry if this is answered in the documentation but I searched it a thousand times. Thanks again!
EDIT
After some help from @Boris I am getting closer to what I want. I was using an example from the docs where a user says 'I need to send money to my mother for my birthday'. When the user wants to use his card to pay, he says' I need money from my amex'.
Here is my intent schema:

 ""intents"": [

this is when i say ""I have $100 to spend""

  const args = conv.message.arg;
 //const text = `How many ${args.cardType} cards?`;

 const { intent: amExUsecardInt, text } = args;

 let amxCardType = text.match(/\S/g) as any; //this will give me something like 'visa' or 'card'

 if (amxType === null) return conv? conv : {} else { return amXUseCard(amxeCard, conv); } } ;

- This is how you select an item in an array of choices. For example, if you want to ask what's your favorite fruit, and you have some options, such as orange, banana, mango and pear, your response should be: ""I like orange."".

Now what can I do after the first intent? I am thinking to make it a separate intent for 'accept' and 'decline' actions or some sort of boolean. Which way should we design it? or is there any better way to do this? 
Any suggestion is appreciated.   I can't think of the proper terminology for this scenario but I hope the question is clear. Thank you
Update 1
I have the current design as given in the diagram
What I was thinking as a solution is that in case of 'Declined' card I will have another Intent with 'intent.hasResultType(CardRejectedAction.class)' and it will be the only 'end point'.  Then after this I should have two Intent objects as follows
  Intent intentA = new Intent(this,CardDeclineActivity. class)...
and
 Intent acceptIntent = Intent...
Hope I haven't asked the wrong question in this question or my question was not clear
Answer
As suggested by @daniel.r I came up with the following design. The flow for CardDeclinated is as shown in following
The intent of Intent1 is CardNumber.CardType.Declining.The response will only be ""Declines""
then I move to the next intent. if the action is ""accept"", then there will not be any response, else there can be a response like Declines, or Accepted
Note if you can think anything to improve this design, feel free to suggest
Intents for the flow
CardAcceptedIntetn 1 =  CardAcceptActivity,
DeclinationIntention = CardTypeDeclinating, (no response required,  just to move on to next intents),
AcceptIntento = No response is expected, just move forward to
next intent, but if response comes back as accept, then this should not move  on, should go back to card acceptance activity to show the results of accepting
card. This design is for a more general scenario."

438,why do you need to know so much about me,"['know ', 'know ']","{}\n Choose the most suitable intent based on the above utterance.\nOptions\n{}\n","Know what?
What is the situation?  

 know is a very common verb and has many forms. For example:  (1)I know you are a good listener.(2)You know that she is not like her sisters.(3)She is aware of the fact that he does not care much for her.  Here, all the cases in which know means 'have an idea about' are listed  and we need just one of them. So,  know = know about is very general in meaning. It may cover almost all of these cases, or a case which is specific. If you use know here, then, the sentence is about that particular person.

  Choose ='select the option among options'.  The options are :
option 1 = I want to buy a car. (I want a vehicle, in general)
You should choose one among your options. You need not explain the reasons to other people. Just go with your choice. In other words, this type of use indicates that there is something to choose from. But, you don't have to specify the options that you have. Instead, You have one option, to start with. That is you know. Your options may change later, but, if you just say: I have some options, I can give you the answer. Then, 'I' is always understood as: 'What do I know', that is, ""I have an option"".  You can say that I'm choosing, for instance, among the different ways of doing a certain task. Or  I choose what I like among different options of something  or  Among the books, that's the book I would like to read next. When you choose, it means that, based upon your previous knowledge, something that could be one and a number of possibilities has been selected by you for the present moment. This may be a simple choice, like selecting between a red and blue colour. Alternatively, a choice may involve much consideration and analysis, such as choosing a job to go for, deciding between two friends, and choosing to move to another place. Sometimes, people may say  ""Choose this option"" or ""Please choose this one"" as a way of urging or requesting a decision. Here is what to use when you want the listener to make a selection:

EDIT: This is more of a conceptual question. What actually gets passed is:
intent.extras.getString(""verification_code"")
Which contains an integer in it. I am asking what actually get passed to the verify intent? I guess I can try to look for something in the docs as well. But can someone explain with an example?  Thanks. :)
A little background -  I have an app that requires verification, and the user inputs the verification code in another app, then I send it back to mine. So basically it's an inter app messaging. Now I'm trying to implement the same thing. Since the data can be sent through various ways (SMS, Email etc), I figured, I'll handle it in my app first, so when the intent arrives, it would have all the information of the message/code sent, the app to which the code was sent etc, but the problem is that in google apps it seems you can only specify the name and not the intents. Or can you? :) And also I want to make sure that if the device supports this feature, google doesn't send an SMS, they just do an internal verification. If the SMS is the only option, i'd want it to be so. The problem I face here is I don't know what to do to handle the result of verify. Because I get no data from verify, what should I do? Is there a place that google keeps this kind of information, or am I missing something? The documentation seems to only discuss the use of int and string extras. And this documentation isn't helping me out in anyway. Thanks a lot in advance. Any help is greatly appreciated. :D

If I perform the same action in my app, the result of the second line is this

444,what do i do if my verification failed,['failed verification'],"{}\n Choose the most suitable intent based on the above utterance.\nOptions\n{}\n","I am using Google Dialogflow v2. My agent is in production and has been running fine for a couple months. Today, all the requests I make in the morning (using Dialflow's REST endpoints) are not accepted and result in a failure. After a bit of searching, I discovered that I can log this kind of errors to a file, which I did. It showed me this error:
{
  ""error"": ""invalid_request"",
}
This is weird because the utterances I'm trying to test are always valid. Is there a way to debug and make sure the intent works in Dialforce's API? If not and it's a Dialbot problem, is there any way I could find out which specific request failed or any other way of getting debug data about the request?
For reference, one example request is: http://api.ai/v2/bot/projects/[project_id]/locations/us/clusters/local/intents/test_int_1/invocations?q=I%20need%201%2F4

EDIT: It's been suggested that this question is similar to this one. But that question deals with a different issue (that the agent fails to send requests on certain days of the week) and is not really the same. I am asking for help to see if this request fails on other days, and, once it does, what are best practices to investigate the issue. For example, do I send a request from a certain IP address to make it fail? That is, if the IP is used often, does it have an effect? The error doesn't give me any information. 
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!
UPDATE: I just did some tests and realized that these requests failed randomly, but never on Monday at 10 a.m. Maybe it was just a coincidence. The errors also happen in batches of 3 to 4. Here are the logs from the error I was talking about:   https//drive......

A:
The difference between the two is whether the intent understands the text. For example, if the user says ""Call me"" and the Intent is the call-intent, then it has no idea whether ""back"" (if it's an Action, not an Intent) should mean calling the caller or calling back the callee, so it doesn't say anything.

Edit (Answer):
The best thing you can do now is to create a custom Action which will do the same job as know app.  In this way it will be available in every app you want and you will not have to ask user if he wants to enable that feature. I suggest you refer to: https//developer.android.google.cn/intl/ja/reference/com.xiaomi.security.sso.SsoAction.html. Please be careful about the permissions you need here."

end session
If the app sends a session cookie back, it receives the token. Otherwise, the application receives a token via an authorization link. (If you have used the verify identity feature, you know that the response contains the id_token and access token.)

The second approach is the ""Authorization code"" approach. I'm going to refer you to the official documentation of Authorization code for further reference on how to implement it: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/authorization/token_flow
Once you get the authorization URL which looks something like this:
https://login.live.net/tb.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&rpsnv=-2&id=d2f9c4d0a9b5a7dfb9a8ae3d4c2b2a2d8a3bf6d7eeb7d9e5b4baf7b0db0dac0bb&sk=4f3f0b8c8fbd7ecb6e1f2ce2e8adcff7f7a0c7e2ee6b1c5c3a4e9df4adf4be4eee26b&lc=1033&s2=&state=cdeef1daec5dab1eb8d1e4df9d3389c9&nonce=5af8b16d
You will need to send an API call to obtain access_tokens. The call you make is similar to one of the below. There are many ways you can make this call. You can either use the Microsoft Graph API or the new Microsoft Flow API
Example call: GET https: //login.live.net /dna/v2.2/audience/c1b34f6c-6f33-4fb5-a5e7-e6dbb17bdd7c/accessTokens

There are several options to achieve this goal and you have to choose the right ones for your case. The most popular tools that deal with user interfaces are IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse or Netbeans. You should look into the documentation of your IDE to find what is the best suitable solution for you. But basically:  
Show system: When you use this option the system will give you a list of options and the user will choose one. It seems that you are using a mobile device. On a touch screen this one is not suited for. I guess you should consider this. As you don't tell us anything about this I can't give any further advice here.  Show identity: This one sounds like the more suitable option for an interactive environment. If all the options the same the UI can show the information directly. This is for a situation like you described. Here again I have absolutely no information for that. Show stupid-system: You can use the show-stupid-id tool if you want more options for the dialog. In this case there will be more buttons and labels to give more information. Or you choose this to get the list and ask the users what you wanna do. A possible scenario is that the tool gives the option to show or choose a new device from the existing one (as a dialog) or that it gives you the choice between the different options (for all)"
468,i am experiencing difficulty providing my identity,"['providing identity', 'providing identity']","{}\n Choose the most suitable intent based on the above utterance.\nOptions\n{}\n","providing identification

I am currently using a very basic NN model (3 layers with sigmoid neurons) trained with TensorFlow. I am quite new to this so forgive me if it sounds stupid. 
How can I use the model to solve such a problem? I would want to pass an identity that represents me as the input of the network as it will have a different representation than the given input. Any direction on how to implement or solve this is highly appreciated!
For your information, here is my current architecture:
# Network
from tensorflow.keras import Sequential
import tensorslayer as tsl
class Net(object):
""""""
Input: a string that contains the text of a name (and possibly a surname), such as ""John Doe""
Output: the corresponding person's (or group's) identity string ""provide(ing) identification"" to ""am(e) providing the identity"" (i.e. the name ""Am"" is identified as identity)
This network returns the result in the ""result"" string
It requires a ""data"" list which contains each entry as an array of shape [samples, tokens, features_idf]
where samples is the number of samples, and tokens is a dictionary which maps a sample name to the list of tokens in that sample, so a token is an arbitrary string (with the exception of blank and punctuations; we ignore these). In an example, this could be: {'John': ['Doe', 'John'], 'Mike': [],...) The feature_idsf_list is just the frequency of each feature, which has to be a list, such that each element in feature vectors is represented by a real-valued number between 0 and 100. The higher the value the more common the word will be. This number can be set to any non-negative number. For example [1, 5, 12,...]. If not mentioned, the feature value is assumed to equal 1. (default) You can specify the values here by adding a new entry under the key ""features_delta_f"" in file ""network_info.py"".

I understand that it's not a valid question but the context is not clear and I can't think of alternative options. 
Thanks for help
PS: I don't want to use the pre tag because I will ask for my name in another question
Example:
How to prove my identy
My question: ""How do I prove I'm Male to be accepted to graduate school?  How to Prove I am Male"" (this is what I want)
Answer (my question): ""To prove your identity, simply choose ""Male"" from the intent chooser. Then say a truth and the system will automatically select one of three intents based upon what you've said.""
What I got: (the correct response I think) How do you prove you're female? - choose the Female intent
Intent: {name:prove,value:female} - (I chose this one) - How would you know that if it were possible?
Another question (how to do my proof):""How would one know if their body was female?"" (choosing female)  - My question was that this would be the same as asking how to know. That's why I added this sentence before my question. (because I thought it would give an option of that intent) (not sure if this works) Thank you
In the response, there's a question that is the first one. It can also be used as an answer. For the latter one I used it as the answer of my original question since it also solves the problem of ""how do one prove their self"".  I chose the option ""I can prove this by..."" in the end instead of the other one because that's the question of this particular question I asked. I also wanted to mention this question for future use. Also I have no idea if my idea of using pre to ask questions is correct. Thanks
So I just learned how questions tags work (at least how my understanding works at the moment).
This is my first question so it may not be clear enough. If so, thank you very much in advance for helping me out. This is why this site is very cool!

This is the function that is called when the utterances are received
function verify(action, intent, options, done)  //verifies the user's
 intent and checks for any other intents and actions that it might
 take. It then decides wether the request should be completed with a
 'yes' 'no' or a 'later' action. This is used when we don't want to
 use a simple answer.

 options - object

  - type - string - This defines what action the intention should  take
 (or what response should get in case the action isn't handled)

 - name - required - The name of the intent to handle this action

 'default': The default response to give in the case no action can  be
 found

 done - callback -  function(response) - A callback that should return a promise
 and resolve/reject depending on wither the conversation will end on itself
 or continue depending if the response was 'done' (user finished talking) or
'no'.  This should resolve whenver the verification of a intent is 'ok', or  reject if it was an error

And then, based the result, I get a different intent depending on if the user said it in the past, or it's a new utterances. Is this an acceptable use of the botbuilder library?
For example, if this is new, then my bot will return the option ""not have"". If this was a pre-set value based in history, it would be:
Option1: have
Answer: Yes
This way, the intent of intent 1 and 2 would not be affected
Is this a valid use case of using the library, and will the solution work? or is there something I don't see? Is there a more appropriate way of doing this? I am pretty inexperienced with the Microsoft bot builder library (as you may guess) so the more in depth answers would help

 If the context does not match the utterances, it will give a generic response. If
there is any other input, such as ""please"" or ""okay"", it is also possible the
bot could handle the request, but it may not be what you expected from the bot, and
the user may need to use the ""start over"" command.

 The most appropriate response can be chosen if it fits all of the following
factors:
 * What the user actually meant (what the message was actually trying to request)
and why it was not satisfied. You may choose to accept a ""not a bot"" error
instead of a general error. See the list of reasons below. This depends on
how well you have defined your bots. A ""real"" person may just want the number
or use something else for their needs. For example, a person can use ""thank
you"" to mean ""thanks"" even if that would not fit a response to a message
requesting the price or the location of an establishment. The ""bot"" might
use a different word for its requests. So make sure you consider how ""your"" bot
behaves before giving a non-conforming response; the same user might have
other bots that work better. It depends how well your bot is implemented (for
instance, if the responses are pre-written or generated at runtime. There are
many different types of user agents for bots, so the best approach for this can
change.  For instance, some people expect a human-like agent for an interactive
conversation, while others prefer a more robotic or canned response that
requires no action from them, or they may prefer to be able to tell what a
specific error means. Some things that may help in making more informed
choices are: ** The intent of your application/bot. ** What is your business
case for the interaction, i.e. what business needs are it attempting to meet? **
How would a typical person use your product or service, how may your
product/service make that easier and/or how will it solve that problem? This
helps to understand how the application or bot would like to"

  Option 1.  card_pin() 

  findpin(name) - Finds the pin and returns a pin object
set pin(new_card_id, pin_index)

Option2. set_intent_and_wait(intent, wait)

 Intent intent (a string indicating what your bot should do) and wait (how long the bot has to respond) are required. The bot must choose one of these two parameters for an intent to work.

 You can specify which parameter to use for your intent from the set intents endpoint:

 set(int intent_type, value) : set an integer to a value. This is useful to update an existing intent  (see the API for examples)  but it can also trigger new interactions (by passing a different value).
Example
https://www.googleapis.com/dialogflow/v2beta1/projects/PROJECT-NAME/agent/environments/E-ENVIRONMENT-ID/interactions/INTERACTION-KEY/set/intent
{
 ""languageCode"": ""en-US"",
....
}
""intent"": {
...
},
The value must be an array of strings. In the example ""card.pin"" is the name of the parameter in the array. There must also be the ""name"": property set with the value the same as ""value"". If set, the intent will be a list or multi-card (multi-choice) interaction. Otherwise, each individual element will trigger the interaction, so you can have as many or as few of any individual string as you like. If your parameter list contains more than one parameter (i.e., card.name, cardnum.cardNumber,... ) then all those values must appear in your value array as well as the 'name' property. ""
Response:
This will return a JSON object that has a success property indicating whether or not it was a valid request. You’ll also see an id property that the client can use to look up the resulting state. Any errors in a response will include a message property with a description of what went wrong. Example responses:  https://developers.dialogue.cloud/docs/reference/api-v1#response-body-"

So the book's text would read more like this:  It would be more correct to read the sentence like  ""I would have (to go) to (travel to) France (for vacation)"" because that gives the reader some context from which to form a more precise intent, which will be much more powerful.

A:
You need to find out why it is wrong:  What is the difference between an apply and a get?  For example, if somebody says I go to the office, they don't say I get in, but I apply. They don’t say what the result is, or how it works, so it‘s not a question at all, it's just what you„ve done. And if they asked, I would probably say: you applied and now you're in the room. You get to go, and you stay until you go. The office doesn't change your passport or make you a German citizen. That happens when you are given the permission to reside in Germany. What it does is give you access to public benefits and services available in that country. This is why I think the verb apply is more appropriate."

Any help or suggestions on what the correct choice is would be appreciated
Thanks. 
P.S I don't want to go to the bank. This has to be done from inside my web application
EDIT: Just to clarify the user would enter the text ""transfer"" ""credit card"" in my application. And in that case, I can't just use ""intent=TransferMoney"" because then the application would always assume what is being input is ""money"". For the example above, the ""user"" can enter ""Money (money transfer)"".   So what should the intent be for this use case? Is there a better way of doing this? I am guessing the best choice would have to come after the fact when someone does the action. However, it is my understanding that you have no way to specify the input that has come from the natural language understanding?  I guess the only way I could get around this is to train a classifier and see if the classification gives me the type of intent that matches my intent for that particular utterness, but that seems like it can get pretty complicated for simple inputs such as I want money sent to this account, not to my other accounts. So how should I do this if possible? Or is there is another approach I haven't yet considered. Thanks in advance!
EDT 2:
Based on your response I would like to add something:  Since you are using ""web service"" I wanted to mention that there are some other ways one could implement a similar use-case. One can use APIs for example and have a service that will perform the transfer and then you can send that back to your webservice which can then use the API and send the funds to that account. Another approach is you could send a link to another webpage that the web app will then take them to and perform that service, etc..  In any case I hope this helps clarify some things.

   I want to know how money got disappeared  ->  the answer is  using the card. And I am getting the correct answer, but I don’t understand why this is asking for the from where and to Where  question and not just the question about how it disappeared. Is it the wrong choice because it is a wrong uttering?
Is there a way to get an answer that doesn't give this kind of questions. Please help. I just want a simple answer. Thank you. Any help in this matter would be very helpful. Thanks."

Example
How do I use my credit cards to buy an item?  I want to use
a store credit for 10 dollars to purchase a DVD. How can I do this? I
know that I can choose my payment method using the menu when I'm done my
purchase. I have two credit/debit cards in my wallet (American Express
and Discover) that show different amounts. Which card would I choose
when I go to the store and purchase the item?""
Option 1
What's the difference between an American Express credit and a
Discover credit? The American expresses are free, and Discover cards
can be linked to a checking bank account. This makes it easier to
manage your budget. What are the major differences between the
American and the Discover?

  Answer: American express (Amex) card provides instant approval for
all purchases and is free. Discover Card can be used in more places as
it has no annual fee and allows you to earn rewards on your money.

 Option 2
 What's going to be the result of using an Amex credit or a Discover
 card for the purchase? AmEx and Discovery cards are basically
identical. However, Discover allows a person to pay for purchases in
cash if he doesn't have a bank checking account, something that is not
affordable for AmX cards. If you want a card that you can use in places
that accept neither a debit nor a visa debit card, the Amxcard is
the one to go for. On the other hand, if you're an active
entertainer, this card is more appropriate for you. There are various
benefits offered by the card:

 a) Free credit reports
 b) No minimum annual fees
 c) Up to $350 a year in bonus cash
 d) Discounts at national chain stores
 e) Access to Priority Pass membership, which offers airport lounge
 access
 f) Receive free insurance coverage
 g) Purchase gifts or electronics online and have them sent to your
 home
 h) Earn airline mileage credit
Answer: Amx is the more preferred option as it provides more benefits
as compared to discovery. A customer who has an amx credit can also
earn bonus"

Update, as requested
The logic I've used to solve the issue is as follows
I used a list from a file where the data is the possible responses in a simple format like this:  { ""response"": ""thisisamresponse""}
Then I created a function where I pass that file and the input and it returns me an intent object. In this function the first action of the intent must be: ""Seeing"", so that is why I add that. Then I go through the rest of all the actions and get me the correct intent and then I return that intent with the right action."

Can you please help?   I'm stuck. Thanks. (sorry if my grammar is bad)
UPDATE
My system will use both a rule base (with about a billion rules) and a finite state transducer. I've built an nltk implementation which I have been evaluating for my problem. The state machine is very important as I will be using that to convert the state into a list of rules to fire. However, for now I am just trying to get the rulebase to play so I can do some basic validation on it (and get my head around that aspect). I would like my rules in this order. Get the intent, if that is not a choice type, then make a top-up or get type of choice, else if the uttertion is 'topping off' etc etc. Please let me know if there is an existing approach to this problem and I'll be happy to try it. My problem is that I need a way that my system should behave when one or more such choices are not found by the model during testing. For example, a user might say 'I'll top it off'. If that was not in my training set I might just give an error of the type not supported at all. Now with some training I could build a new model to support that, but for testing (when a 'not-found' condition applies) my model would still behave and not give this error, just that 'what to choose next' (if any) is based off the intonation of that utter. So I know my issue is with the nlp (not how do to it in any way).
If I get some help with this question, I may be less interested in a general nlu problem, and just be interested to know how to handle the not-available-intent problem using a state-based approach (i.e. state transition rules). That would make it a lot less complicated. Anyways I really appreciate your interest :)"
540,is there a way to transfer funds directly from my card?,"['transfer funds', 'transfer card']","{}\n Choose the most suitable intent based on the above utterance.\nOptions\n{}\n","paybill
choose transfer 

A:
“Transfer funds” and “transfer payment’ are synonymous. They mean the same. But the former is a little more specific. For example, ‘I want to pay someone‘ can be phrased as an ’intent : ‹I_want_to_pay_someone›. You can have other, even simpler, forms. Like ”‚¡I will transfer the funds tomorrow at 2:00‛. In this case the action and the target are the two same thing. It s up to the system how to interpret the request.   You have 3 options: You either need the bank account, you want the person‟s wallet or you need to send money. The system needs to decide what you actually wanted„
As for pay bill, I guess this is the one that needs the more elaborate explanation. Pay bill can mean something like send the money to a specific account or just sending the payment. So it‪s the intent that you express. When you transfer a payment to someone you are transferring it to their account as opposed to sending it there.‫"

Are there lists of these kinds of sentences and examples? Is this the right approach to handle utterances using virtual or real cards. 
I would also like to know about virtual/real cards, how and when would I use it. Should I be able to use this approach in all contexts or are there certain contexts in which it would be better to go ahead with real card (for example, in a case where the user does not have the real plastic card but still wants to buy something).
EDIT (after the answer below):
After reading the answers I would like add the following. The answers below explain in detail the different use cases for virtual and real. My question was more about if there are any grammatical patterns for real and virtual use. So if someone is saying ""I have a virtual credit card"" and we want to make an intent detection whether this is an actual credit or virtual, the use-case would still be the same as it is a real credit. If someone says ""This is my virtual account card"", the intent would probably be different (e.g. account balance, credit limit, etc.).
In my example above, I tried hard to explain that the context makes all the difference and a sentence like ""Let's order a coffee"". If we were to ask: ""Where have you got the card?"" then we are probably looking for a location, not the financial intent. However, if the intention is clear from the sentence itself, then it's ok to assume that it could be real or a fake, but in any case that would have an effect on how the intents are mapped or the language models. I understand now that virtual has a special meaning and should be used only for this specific case. For me it was hard explaining this because most of the documentation I found did not use the term ""virtual"" for any specific use case, and used the word ""card"" instead. In most cases the sentences would use both. It can be a confusing approach. Now I see that I am overthinking it!   (see also answer above)
Thanks to all your help and feedback. Really great. All the best!

This is a fairly simple task for a human, but is it so hard for NLP?
If this is too ambitious for me what else is there out there? I am looking for something that I can use in practice and not just an academic exercise.   I was wondering how others would approach this problem. I also need to be mindful of what is happening if the data is stored in the cloud, as I will have to write my code to use data stored on a third party service. How would I deal with this? Should I even use a NNR in this instance. Should this even be approached by Natural Language Processing? If so how can it be done, is the best tool to approach the problem in, and would it solve the initial question that is driving me to make this post? Are there any alternatives that would make better sense? My only problem is I don't know what I want to ask, the only answer I really have is to look for answers, I could write a bunch of code and then try and use an API, or I write some Python code for an example, which one would be the simplest solution? Is any of this possible? Do you know of any better resources than Stack Overflow that could help in a project of such magnitude? Or do I just need more experience? Thanks!
Update after the answer from @JuanMiguelRojas
Thanks for your answer. The code you posted works, except for the part regarding punctuation. As it stands I have added the following as an attempt to remove punctuations. Is this a reasonable approach for such a task? As I say, not a good code by any means but if I use it as is, it would work. Also I do not need the full sentence, just the name and the number. Here is my new code. Would be glad for some feedback

A:
There is no other option, you must use ""used in"". You can add some more context, such as, ""I wanted to make an order and the cashier accepted my payment using my credit card, but you know I didn’t make that purchase with my Visa credit/debit card."", or ""the cashiers accepted the payment that I used for my groceries but I” wasn‘t able to use it on my purchase""."

When a request comes in that is related to an app, the system looks at the request and identifies the best action to take based in the
  following logic:
An App is a unique Android Application designed to do a specific function like payment, or sharing. Android apps are
created using a programming language known as kotlin that combines Java and kalashnikov script. In android,
kotlinscript is used to write Android application code. Kotlins is the extension of klason that makes the coding
easier. Using this extension, programmers are able to work on large scale android app development. This script allows
app developers to develop applications in android and share it. It is similar to JavaScript that we use in web development and
is also similar in syntax to that of python. 
You can see the source code for Kotlin from the following link
https://developer.android.com/studio/write/klock
If your app is installed on Android 5.0 or above, your apps will be listed in Android Market (Android App on Google Play).
To install an application, you should be logged into an active Google account, which is required for Google accounts in
order to manage applications you have downloaded from Android market."

I think this question is quite confusing. You seem to assume that your account is in some kind of danger based only on what another user on a public forum said. This is a very bad approach. The fact that an utterant used a PIN (or a credit card number) means nothing. It is perfectly normal to use a fake PIN.

[UPDATE: I am now using Google Assistant, not only for ASK, but also for the DialogFlow API]
Update 1: After a few days of trial, Google has provided me a new service: Dialogs API for Natural Language. It is still beta, unfortunately, you can only see some examples on this URL. But it will help you a lot. I tried to use this service for two examples and the results I got are quite good. In fact, it is really easy to integrate this into a web-app. However, they have not provided any examples. The best example I can find is:  https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/demos/hello-world-nodejs
The result of this dialog is very promising. Of course, there are some mistakes, for example, in some sentences (eg, if you say, ""I have a problem with my computer""), it says there is no error, and some error codes (e.g, when you have entered the wrong phone number) it gives a very detailed error code. As a beginner, this will be difficult to write your own dialog flow. And this is a good thing - at last, no need to implement your natural speech processing in a handcrafted way. :)
This is the link of my post at the day when I wrote this comment: https: //forum.dartlang.org/thread/mvz4m0z7t1fjwjq4h8z#start=0

A:
What are possible options if you suspect fraud?
First you should try to understand what is your concern and then select a right way to get this info. 
1) You should read about what you can get from your card statement and how does it work, check if there is any way your phone app could give you this information directly with user permission. Check if your payment gateway has this capability. You can also send a notification to your bank account and try checking it, but not recommended to do this as it can be annoying for the user. For example you could check the available balance in your app or ask the app if he could get current balance. But there might be a lot of things you cannot do from the statement, like: transfer money, add card to a gift card, cancel an order, etc. And also it is possible that user would not answer to question ""Can you get balance?"" in time - you need to think about time when you want to receive this response - now, in a moment of payment transaction or later. When user will answer ""yes"", you will have a balance, when he will say ""no"", there will be no balance for this card and you have nothing to worry about. This will cause some problems if user can't respond in the moment when card is being used. In such cases it will not be possible to detect if card was used by a user or an attacker, you might get negative balance if somebody else used your account, your transaction history might not match what will appear on card - all this is a problem, and your question shows you are aware of this and it should be taken into account when designing your feature. I will suggest to use the latest features from bank statements, for example, get only current transaction and previous transactions if it was more than X days (for example 2 months) before to check it. If you don't want all previous statements (not even the last transaction) in this case, consider the balance of the card as your balance to show instead of balance from statement. Your app doesn't have to have all the features, it has to make decisions based only on your concerns (this is why you asked question about intent)."

The atm would decide which card it wants based upon the information you have provided in your example, and would not accept anything else. So the answer is that there is no way to tell which cards the ATMs will be able to accept, nor which one a customer is likely to attempt first (if he/she hasn't yet figured it out).
To answer the question, if you're not willing to pay with a card, it would be hard to imagine why you'd want to buy a prepaid card that requires more data."

A: You got it right! The user can pick any location that the user wants to visit, so in this case the system will ask which location the customer prefers to enter. Then, when it receives this preference, the intent will return to that location. In this example, I have chosen to return the selected location as the destination, but in other situations, you might want to just return a value as your response. For example you may have a user enter a home address, and when the response is returned as a location, simply return that address. There’s no right or wrong choice, just a preference to give back to your caller. You can learn more with our help article. Here‘s a link to an example: https://dialogflow.com/docs/fulfillment-mapping/intent-with-parameter-values#intent--use--card---at---bank

This code is working, but I was wondering if there is a simpler implementation for intent-detection? And I am curious as to what the different types of utterances in a dialog act are. Thanks for the help in advance!
Edit:
I just learned about the intent. So what would the following uttering do? 
Option 1: If i'm at the checkout register what am i paying for? <paycard intent?>
Is there a simple way to detect this? It doesn't make sense to give me the option to pay for a $5 cup of coffee when I'm ordering a drink, right? I can think of a way where I would have a conversation with the user (if you want coffee, order it. If you don't, you can leave). But I donno if this is what I should be trying to accomplish.   What I want to do is make sure the customer can only purchase things that are in my shopping cart. I will probably be able to get an array of things from the API. But for now I just have coffee and donuts in the cart and am trying out the bot. Can I tell the chatbot to only let them buy coffee? Do I have to say ""hey, I only have two items in cart at this time. You only can pay with a card for one of the items""?
Thanks!  :)
EDIT2
So the first step is to know to which entity (user, intent, slot, value) a given utteration is directed. In this case I understand that the utterion (in this example) is for an intent named pay-card and this intent has 3 slots (name, type, number) and 2 values (card, cash-or-check).
For now, the only way I think my bot could be aware of what is in what slot and what value is associated to it is if I had a chat bot that would listen for different utterings (e.g. ""I'd like to buy donut"")
That would let me know that this utterning is related to intent PayCard (for donat), and that it's value (donut) has 2 sub-values (""chocolate"", ""white-choc-chip"

How am I able to get pass-code in the first case, and not get an utter error from the app in later cases?
The error that I receive is,
I/onCreate: {""code"":2,""error"":"""",""msg"":""intent is not registered""}
Is a passCode of a wrong type needed for an ""enter pass"" intent to work? It is the only intent available in my project's manifest file. 
In addition,  why does the application work when there is an explicit pass on in Android's built in apps, such as the dialer?  I would like to understand how this is possible in any way, even if I did not have access to the code for any of the apps above. My app is also not showing up in ""Settings >> Security >> Manage Apps >> Your App"".
Thanks. I am a newbie in android app programming, so this error could be really basic for some others out there. Any insights would be a huge help. Also, any other suggestions how to fix the problem in a better way is much appreciated. (I know this should be posted on Stack Overflow, but due to low reputation I don't have the privileges to do so.)
Thank you. :)
UPDATE: Thanks to all of you down-voting and leaving answers. The answers are all really helpful, however, the reason I didn't realize that it was a simple mistake, was that the error was really specific (see the question) and I have been looking for it for weeks. So, sorry again for taking so long to figure it out. As an FYI for anyone who has a similar issue, I was looking into different options and found the answer (as stated above) here in this answer. This question is still unanswered. Thank you once again. :-).
Please let me know if there are any further questions about it in comments. Thanks :).   :P
ANSWER: The solution was to have a specific intent with action ""android.provider.Settings.ACTION_MANAGE_ACCOUNTS"" and a unique string parameter to make it more obvious about the fact of what was wrong with the intents. Once this issue was resolved I got a much better error in which to search for the mistake I made. That's why"

I don't know where to start. If anyone can help with the start up it would be much appreciated. Thankyou. I am new to NLP and have only been using it for a month or so. 
The output I want to use to classify is:
Option 1: A user tries to recover a lost password. The user says to the chatbot, ""Lost my username"". The answer can be anything. This is an option. Option 2: The chat bot sends a message to a user who says ""help"" or ""hi"" The message can say, anything, but it has to be something from the domain of, what would a chat room bot usually say in response. It can use any language or dialect of its choosing and does not have to have the same wording as the user. So this can include a simple, automated message like, Hi, and can also include more complex messages such as, Welcome to this room, this is a very helpful room. These are some examples. Also, a bot can send any messages that it wants to send, even if these don’t make sense to me. For example, the bot could say something like Hi. or Hi there. this should be a valid classification. In this situation, I would assume I was dealing with a generic message with no intent. (Note: These two scenarios are hypothetical examples).
Edit: Added a couple of examples of what I think is valid messages. Added the first example of where I might not know if it is intent or generic and that there is still some information I need to extract for classification
My output will be:   1. A generic text message that the conversation started with something similar to, “Hi” or ”Hey“. ‘Hi,‘ and ’Hey, How are you‟ is generic, with only some intent and not an explicit intent like‪ 'Hi I lostmy username'. 2. a text that starts with ‚This is‚ or some other explicit statement, or if I know some language. Example ‟This room is great.„, then my understanding is the language is English and if there was no other information in this text, it might be generic or an „explicit utterances‹. 3"

The first example will return the value of the variable $pwd. If the answer is not in a variable then the default value, null, will be returned. 
This is probably what your teacher expects you to do. The second example is a little more complicated. Because it is more verbose but the intent of this code is to find the type from the string given. Therefore it should return one of three types of intent that is associated with this string. This will give you more control. Note that it uses an array instead of a string, this is so that you can have more than one variable, the example given is only one. As a side effect this example also returns the number of variables associated to a given intent. It works like this, it loops the array, for each element, if there is an intent associated then it returns this intent, or else it checks each item in the list."

A:
If you have an old phone or phone that you don’t use all that frequently, you can reset the passcodes to all on your phone to get the phone back into a useable state. There are 2 methods for changing the passwords. If you still have access to the original phone, then you will just need a paperclip or pen. Alternatively your can download an app like passreset that does the same exact thing. I personally only use a piece of paper and a pen because I do not want to download something on my phone with my personal information. So if your worried about your personal data then download the app and use that. Otherwise you just press and hold on both numbers and the password will be changed to 0000."

I am able to parse the intent and am having a hard time determining the best method to use. I'm using a custom Dialogflow agent on GCP Firebase. When I type ""change name"" into the input field, I get the expected response as a Google Assistant intent response. However, when I try ""resend password"" or ""how to reset password,"" I receive a response of ""None of my assistants can help you with that"" in the response field. 
The problem stems from how my Dialogs work. The ""How to..."" example is a simple if else flow which returns the ""Yes"" response or the other options which return ""No"" if the first statement is false. So in my code I have
if (response == 'change_name') {
  ...
} else if (isNotTheOtherOption(response,'reset_password')) { // this is where I think I am messing up
 // the else condition is returning ""NONE of your assistants will help with [the input].""
 response = 'I would have reset that, but no. It will be handled later.'
 }
...

 return response;
This is what I did for testing purposes. Is the issue a typo in how I wrote the second if condition or am I implementing the condition correctly?  In a nutshell, is there a better way to check if something is one of the available intents other than checking each intent? My current code is very messy and I would like to know if there is some way of checking that all ints are included in an array. For instance, if I were to ask what are the colors I could use and the array of available colors in that order (i.e. ""blue"", ""red"", etc..) then I do not know how to iterate the whole array to test each one. What I was thinking was to say something like ""I need the color blue"" instead of having to go through the entire list of all colors. Any guidance in this area would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance. If I can be of any more help, please don't hesitate to let me know. :)

So, I have the intent money, but how can I get the slot 'name' and  slot  'confidence' from the utterances?
Please help. Thanks in advanced. :D
Regards,Anjith.R
UPDATE:
My problem is not the confidence or the slots. My problem here is that I am using'speechrecognizer' library and my utternce comes out as a string. So, basically the format I need  is to take a text string (say,'money') and convert it into slot values. Please, someone help me with this issue. I really would be thankful to you. :) :))
Thanks in advance.Regds, Anjita S.H.S
P. S: Please ignore all the mistakes I made, since this is my first time on Stack Overflow  :) Thanks!  : D
ANSWER: So as I said, slots are not my problem. In my case, the speech recognition is taking strings as an input and returning a vector of strings. What I want now, is a way to pass this vector to  my slot model, and then have to output something like this :  [slot] : slot_name,  and for my model to get something  like  this  (  name : money)
Any ideas on this would really be appreciated. Thank you! :)

d
The following steps were required to implement an intent and a slot for the utterances.  

 1. Create the intents and the slots. In my case i have two intets. one for money and second for transfer. (I have used these intet for an example in this answer)
 Intent intentMoney = new Intent(Money.class);
 intentPay = intent Money;

  Intent.setClassName(context, ""com.google.andrey_it.intent.MoneyIntentAction"");
intentSale  =  new  IntenetSelling.IntetForSell(this,this.getApplicationContext());

 Intent moneyIntents[] = { intentSce1, intentTransfer,intent, payIntenent,};
 Slot money[]= {slotPay1,""money"",slotSeal ,""money""};

 2. Declare an array list to hold all the slottypes that your app can use. This array is optional. But it makes the code easier to follow.

 @Override
 public void onLoadIntets(IntentionLoader intentLoader) {
 int  intentId[] ={money,transer};  //here i am using same array for two different intests.but this can also be different
 ArrayList<SlotType> slotTypeArray =new ArrayLis
t<slotType>(intentId.length);  /*here you can have as many intenttypes as you like. but if you have just 2 intent types in your case only two arraylist is necessary. as for example you just two types of intes and two slots for intenrt types. here i will just make an int array to intantify. */
int intentType[]={0,1};//here are two intent id for different intent
 for(int i=0;  i<intenttype.size(); i++){  if(intentType[i]==0){
 slottype = slotTypes1[intentid[0]];
 }else{
slottype=""money"";
}
this slot is used for pay intent. for transaction intent the same slot will be used. I have created this array. because i just have 2 types for intent but you might have more."

A:
""Hi""
An important part of dialogs is context, i.e the conversation. 
In order for your bot to behave as expected, you need a way to understand the context. The ""Hello"" intent does not necessarily mean that your user is saying hi, so it would make sense that you are prompting an inteaction that can help in finding a suitable response. A typical approach for this is to first find the account the dialog is coming from, and use that context when deciding wether to respond or not.

The utterances I have to handle are
- delete account (which is the default action that will be performed on clicking on delete)
Option 3 will show the dialog asking to confirm the delete
I tried the following in Dialogflow to figure out what the best action to take is
const DeleteAccount = dialogflow.Intent({
   //...
 })
.setRequiredPrompts({dialogInput: {
title: 'Confirm Delete',
subtitle:'Are you sure you want delete your account?'
}
});
... and  this dialog shows up when I am trying to delete an account. And the response is Option 3  'rid Account'
Is there any way i can get the desired result in this case?  I know it will work fine if i just handle 'delete Account', but i want something more intelligent as in what to do if the user asks for a confirmation for some other valid intents.  The user cannot just ask to 'Delete' the account, the intent has to be valid or else there should be some way around it. Please correct me if I'm wrong  and explain why this is happening. I will greatly appreciate it!
My intention is to have the utterant handle any valid intent (with or without a dialog), and then if it is not a valid  request,  just ignore it and let the app do a default behavior like the deletion. Is it possible for me? and if so, what should i put in my intent?
Edit -  My Dialogs/Intents code is in Python. This is what is working:
agent.add_listener(LISTEN_TYPE_INPUT, LISTENER_EVENT_CLOSED)  # Listen for closed events
# agent.handle_event('greetings')  will send to the bot as a greeting
print ""hello""
intent = agent['greeting']
speech_results = json.loads(agent['speech'].get_reply_text())

A:
If you want to know if a particular option is a good fit for your data, you'd have to train a model. One of the first things you should do is make sure your dataset is representative of your intent space. If you have an underrepresented intent in your examples, then your model will learn to pick that intent as the top answer, regardless of what the data actually says. 
The way you would do this is to have a human annotate your samples with the appropriate intent tag. You'd then have the model take a list of these and see which one gets its prediction the closest."

I will do one of three things. First I will use NLP (natural language processing) to understand that you are asking for a credit card or debit card. If not, I’ll simply reply “no”. 
Once you‘ve chosen, it‚s time to get the data you need. In our scenario, you just need the name and the expiry date. So it will be like;‧
var cardName and cardExpiry„ = ‹your input›;
  ‖
GetNameOfCard(cardName)‬; //gets info from database and sets to string variable
CalculateExpirationDate(“ {0}   {1}
This will create a string with the information you wanted, ex:‪  ‭ "" Name of Card‐  Card Expirty…‌‰"",cardExpriry‮‍
if you don‟t want anything to be set, then just remove the line ’CalucateExpiryDate()‹."

A:
The intent that should be fired for this utterances is ""Cancel Card Request"".
If you are trying to get the card number from the user, and you have the utterment ""pull my ATM card"" in it, you should add ""card"" to the intent name as the following: ""I did not find my credit card in my wallet.

How it can be done?
Here is what my plan is:
1) If the user says get coffee the app should first check if the utterances of the coffee related intent is there in the database (i.e: Order Coffee)
2)If the answer is positive 
a) if it is in response to the current action (I want to get some coffee right now.), I would like to update the db so that I can save the order in my DB, if there is a better way i will also learn it.   and if not, the action intent should proceed , if its not the right intent, I don't want the response action
b)if its in a response of some other action i would just pass,  If i dont know the exact utterant I should ask for the intent. In either case  the next intent i.g. Order coffee, should be the main action. so the sequence would be  Order Cofee ->  getCoffee and  it shouldnt continue any further
I am a very new student at android and not good at java, this is my first question here and I hope that the community will help me with this, If you feel that i need to add any info please let me know. Thanks. :)  Thanks a million
@Edit: If this doesnt work i am willing to pay the price
The following is not what i want
A. When i order a coffee I want it to be sent to my phone. It is sent via some api/server
B. I also need some functionality for ordering a beer. So that is why I am using both intent and response in one app
Thanks
Edit 2: The app I have mentioned will be available for iphone/android  users. The response i can get for ""getCofeewww.coffeethemes.org""
and when i say order coffee it does  ""www.google.com"" or ""google""  for google to find the appropriate intent  (and its just a simple java script request). Thanks for your time. (The app is also not finished )
Also i think i should also point out that these utternents are not in natural language. Its just an example to make my question more clear i guess"

See the intent documentation for more about this. There are different types of intent, each with different options and uses. Check out the Intents class which defines all of the intents. 
An agent intent is composed of a name, a user id of that the caller can use to identify the call when it arrives (for 'give' and 'choosing' intenstes this will be a numeric value), the value, and the arguments. When it comes to 'ate' intent the only argument that it takes is the card number.

 **Example**: 

   - `{ ""action"":""IntentsService/giveCardInttend"", ""user_locale"":""en_US"" }`
  => '{""action"": ""Intntend/GiveCard"",
""userLocale"":  ""en"",  <--- locale for ""give"" (only required for locale intnted intent)
 ""name"": ""'give_card'"", <-- intent name for add call
 value"": ""<card number>"", } '

 -  ` { ""agent_request"":{<agent request>} } `
 => ` '{
'<card>': < card no. >
 < 'user' id : '<num>' >  // (req. for choose, giving,...
 }"

What do I do
Choose the correct utterances based of the following options. 
Give at ms
If you say 'give an ATM a card'
It will ask you if the card you want to give is in cash or check, and your response
will tell the program whether you wish to perform that action. So this option is valid
Answer: give an  ATMs
You are wrong
So this is invalid
The correct answer has to be:
A:  Atm   |B:Give
Choice: (A) Atms are machines that give money  (B)Give  an AtM

A:
The best solution in this particular situation is to use a library such as this which allows you to parse the ATR to find the intent. The library has a demo that shows how to make a request based. This demo is using a JSON object with a string property ""utterance"" which contains the string that was recognized by the bot. 
You can also see the demo of an Intent Parser which can be used for more complex grammars."

What you are trying to do is a simple example of Intent-Based Speech Recognition. I've provided an overview of this concept in this link. There are multiple components to achieve that goal but your question is not clear enough on this point. If you're interested in getting an idea you should start by reading this article. The first step is to create a dictionary using the following code. This can be done manually or in any code you might have. For example:  Python .
def createDictionary(myDict):
  return  {'intent': ""c"",""card"": 'card number','fromAccount': 'current account'}
mydict = getDictionList()
print('')
for w in mydict.values():
 if str(w[0]) not in dictionary.keys(): dictionary[str(intent)]+=1
 print(dictionary) # print the dictionary
return dictionary#return the complete dictionary as dictionary of key:value pairs
if __name__ == '__main__':
 create_diction_map()#create the new dictionary in a separate file
 read_dict_from_file() #read the file of values from the list file for the keys 'intent' and 'action' , then return the same as the function  create dictionnary() above. We'll use it later."

I just want to make a payment. I don’t want anything else. Can you just give me my money back?

How would you recommend solving this? I'm looking into options such as intent detectors, NLP or something in between. The problem I have is that I need some way to determine which card to charge and which to not charge. It can be assumed that the user would just have one card on account. Thanks. 
EDIT:   I would prefer the option to do this in python 3.3. Please don't mention any libraries or frameworks that may be available in other languages or other frameworks. Thank you. My main goal is just to understand the process behind this. If there already exists libraries for this kind of thing please point those out to me but I'd like to just use what would appear to be a simple approach to this problem. That's all. No libraries. Just some simple python code. Or if there is some python or java or c# library that is already out there I could use that. This question was answered. :)
Thanks. Again. ;)  Thanks!
Edit 3:
Thank you all for your responses. They have been really helpful and I'll be sure to take them into consideration. :D
It sounds like some kind if a bot could be the best approach?  If that's the case, how would I go about doing that? Is that what it's generally called? If so, where do I start to look to see how that could work? A bot is basically a system, correct? And what system could I use for that, I suppose, a server program, for example? Do I look at something like web.py, which I saw as an example here? Or do bots run off their own server? Where would a program like that run? Could someone please link me to some tutorials or whatever if you are familiar with what I am asking? :)  It seems like it would be very basic for a programmer but that would take some basic knowledge on my part and that seems to defeat the purpose. :(  Is there maybe something I should look into in a general programming sense for what to use? Like a library? Any advice? :S

A:
. 
Option (1) is incorrect in that a transfer is not an intent. Option (2) uses a different verb than the question, and is also incorrect as an answer. The best answer is (3).
The verb in option (4) should be is seeing (instead of is). I don't think the answer should use -ing form, unless that's part of the sentence itself."
798,i got charged and extra fee when i transferred money so why was i charged?,"['transferred money', 'extra fee', 'charged money']","{}\n Choose the most suitable intent based on the above utterance.\nOptions\n{}\n","money transfer

My approach:
This is a very basic sentence. If you want it to be more sophisticated/complete, the structure should change. I recommend this. 
Option 1: 

  Sentence structure will be,   ""The money was transferred to the account of XYZ in  XYX.""
  The prepositional phrase ""to"" needs to come at the start of the sentence: ""the money to was"" etc
If you use the word ""account"", you are describing a monetary account. You can say ""a fee is charged in a ____ account""
Also note that the ""money was"", ""was transferred"", and ""is charged"" do not need ""extra"", because they are all describing the same object (money)
I recommend keeping ""transfer"" out of it because you will have a more complicated sentence (see option 2)  later on
You can also use ""charged to"", but I'm not sure what it is describing, so that's a poor choice
The best sentence to use will probably be some combination of 2 and 3. It will also be very hard to tell which option is correct because of all the options
(The most likely is 2, 3, or 4)

 Option 2: The money got transferred in the bank.

 Sentences are usually written with a verb in past perfect tense, ""has been transferred""  (or ""have been/was"")  In this sentence, there is only a past tense verb, but the preposition ""in"" changes ""transferred"" to ""got"", since ""get"" here means ""take something somewhere"" not ""pay money"".
Sentence 1 is more accurate

 Options: 1. The charge for the money transfer was more than expected
2. For the first $2,000, we will charge a service fee for money transfers
3. A service charge will start at $10


Question 2
Given a text (sentence) of a conversation, how do you write a program that outputs a summary of that same conversation in English?

 I would recommend you to break it down into sentences and tokens, and create an index of words or phrases and a list of sentences where they appear, then for each sentence do something like this:

A:
(1). transfer is the same as ask or get in some other words. 
I think, that it will be more easier to understand the grammar of sentence 2. by using 'transfer' instead of 'ask for'."

804,how can someone send me money?,"['send money', 'send money']","{}\n Choose the most suitable intent based on the above utterance.\nOptions\n{}\n","transfer money to bank
 transfer money into my bank account

A:
The first one and the third ones are not really the same and are different concepts.  
1) send money: The sender sends the money that the recipient has to the receiver of the transfer (which can be the bank).  The transaction (from the point where sender to receiver) is done in seconds and there is no confirmation of a successful payment. (I think there are some limitations to such transfers, but don't know the details. If I remember correctly there a restrictions regarding the amount of money)
2) transfer to / into bank: It's the opposite of 1). The receiver gets the funds from the sender (the money is sent to some bank and from there to his/her account). If the account doesn't exist or the balance for the new account is insufficient (and there has been a transfer of that money in the meantime) you need to make a request which has an amount and to where you want to send the transaction. In this case your transaction has not been done automatically and has a longer time between sending the data and receiving it. For example if a bank sends a check to your account then it is a lot like 1) with a short delay between the sending of data (to where the check has be sent) and confirmation. But you have to do the request yourself. I think you should read more about transactions on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactions
3) to my Bank account: This is something similar to 2). It is usually done by a mobile phone where a text message is used. The text messages often contain an application id (or a unique device) which is registered in a backend (usually a server). You need an account number for your bank which can often be obtained by filling a form on your web account. Then you can send a message which will be transferred to and processed by this backend. Depending on if the backend has your application installed or not it might result in different behavior. A similar method to use on webpages is to login to a website and then use the ""pay from a wallet"" which you got with the login. This usually is more secure but a bit more tedious. Usually it's done with SMS for mobile clients"

What's the answer? If it's ""send"", then I need to return ""for you, or pay"" in my answer for the question ""How to pay for _______?"", otherwise I should return null (I don't know).
The best solution I've found so far is to check the word ""money"". If the input word begins with ""Money"", and ends with ""-ment"", I return the string ""payment"". Otherwise, I get the user's input again with prompt ""What is the money's type?"".
I have tested this on my phone (and I have an app for Android and web).  My code runs perfectly except for one problem.  If I don’t type anything at all after typing the name of the payment I want to make, my app prompts with a message that says ""Please enter your recipient‘s details"" with three options that are listed on a web page. After the three steps of this process, the app crashes when trying to save the details for future transactions. I assume this is because this line of code gets executed when the web address is loaded:
String url = ""<?php echo base_url().""/transactions/add_payment.php"";?>"";
WebView mWebview = (WebVIew) view.findViewById(R.id.webview);
mWebkit.loadURL(url); 
This error can be resolved by simply adding the following code:   webview.setWebChromeClient(new WebChromClient());
However, this would mean that the prompt will never pop up and I cannot continue until I press one of three buttons. The reason I'm writing this question is that I do need the error message in case the person has not yet supplied their details. So that they can continue and not have to re-enter it. Also, if they want me to change the wording in the code, they'll want this change made at the beginning of their program. My web-programming knowledge is limited to this so I‚m asking people who are smarter than me for a better way to approach this problem!
Here is an example of a prompt that appears if no payment amount, recipient, and/or other details are provided: https://drive.google"

A:
I solved it! I have written down the answer for people like me, who have similar query to mine and don't get any clue on how it's supposed to be done. I am posting the solution here so that i can help some other people as well. It will save some time for anyone who might have same question as mine. This tutorial can be very helpful for newbies like us. So, here's the tutorial:  How to get intent for an intent
First thing which you need to write is to use intentservice. To start that, create this: ""com.bignote.IntentsTest"" as ""Android Application"".
Then, in the intenteditor.jsp we need the following code:

  <html>
  <!--
<form method=""post"">
Intent intent = new Intent(Intendservices.ACTION_VIEW);
intent.setClassName(""com"", ""bigo"", Intents.class); // change the package name to yours
 intent.putExtra(""inputString"", inputString);  // put your input here. it needs to have a string value.

 intentintent = Intent.createChooser(intent, ""Select Your choice""); 

 try{
 startActivity(intentintent);

 }catch(ActivityNotFoundException e){

 Toast.makeText(getBaseContext(), ""You've not yet installed an app to play with it."", Toast .LENGTH_LONG).show();
 }
 </form>

 </html -->  Now you're on ""Intendeditor"". Write the text which i mentioned above there. After writing it, click the blue pencil button. Then, it will pop up a list of intent to choose from. Here are few options for you: Deposit - Withdraw - Make Payment - Cancel Payment. Check ""deposite"". Click the check button and it'll be saved. The same thing applies to ""withdrawal"" and ""make payment"" etc. In the end, check"
829,how do i get my salary through this account?,"['get salary', 'get account']","{}\n Choose the most suitable intent based on the above utterance.\nOptions\n{}\n","show account info

A:
a) The best choice is ""get salary"", because you want to tell what you are going to get, that's it. It's simple, and you don't need to care about whether it's your account or someone else. So, your bot should know this intent and choose it at the point where you get asked about getting a salary. If you were not at this point, then you could either choose your own account (that's a good idea for a bot, but not here) or get a new one with a fresh balance. (But this requires a user to provide a phone number.)
If you choose ""show acount info"", then the user will be able to see your balance in the bot. This is the same as you having a web account, except that you can tell it to show that info in a chat session using an API."

i'm having 2 classes for the two options of Intent
TransferMoneyIntent.class

for the first part (intent) i've got a simple activity with 3 options (1/none, 2/transfer). 
I'm using a onClickListener and a button, which is set as the button with the intent.   I have the correct options and the ""none of them are"" response, but my question is, can the response ""None of these are correct"" be an option of a response for an Intent?  Is there a reason why i can't select ""the option is none? (i.e - i'm trying to avoid having to change the question in the test activity to ""what is the option?"") I feel that this is an obvious answer, so please don't be too harsh, its just for me!
The second part of i have to use the same onTouchListener on a edittext, if i select one of two buttons (from the activity) the onEditText changes. My problem is that the editext can contain anything from nothing to a currency string. In the second activity im using this to check whether the answer is ""transfer"" ""currency transfer"" or ""nothing"" as an int. but i think there is a problem here too, I think it would be best if the string in editText had only ""£"" (or whatever the currency is on my device).

A:
The transfer amount can be the number, ""some money"" or a range like: ""3-5"".
You will have to check for those options. For money, you can use the ""do.money"" action. If you want some money then try the action ""doing.account"" and check if it returns a number."

Transfer money (3)   - transfer money from another account to this account.  If the source account has a balance, the target account will be credited with the same amount of balance. If no balance exists in this source  account, then the destination account should be debited to 0. To avoid being charged for this transaction, you may choose this intent  if the amount transferred is less than  the current account balance of the  source or target  accounts. Note that this  transfer will  be  processed on a  different platform than the original  request, and may take some time. The transaction request may be returned  before the transaction is completed. Once finished,  an alert will notify if  you have  been charged. After the transfer is complete, a confirmation receipt will display the completed transfer and your new balance will reflect that  your original balance is now greater than what is transferred. Please note that the confirmation  receipt may show an incorrect value depending on when the request is submitted. Your  confirmation code will expire and you will need to reenter a new one if you wish to  continue with transfer. You can check your account transactions by viewing the ""Transaction History"" link on My Account Details
 Transfer funds (2) -  send a transfer payment. This transaction type will transfer your balance between two or more accounts  on  a single platform without incurring a network fee. A confirmation page will appear upon completion of this transfer  and a receipt indicating when your payment was made with your  balance after the payment is processed  The  transaction  will not be confirmed or processed until your confirmation is received. It is your responsibility to make certain the balance  of target accounts matches the sum of source balance and transaction amount. Otherwise the transactions will still be processed for the account balances and an error will show on your screen. Transaction types that transfer balance can not transfer an overpayment. Overpayments or over-writes of negative balances are not allowed and the accounts are cancelled or marked for deletion. When a transaction with  overpay will attempt to transfer the overpaid balance to the intended destination  this will cancel the first attempt. As an example a payment with a zero amount will return a 0"
848,can i add funds to the card directly from my bank account?,"['add funds', 'bank account', 'add account']","{}\n Choose the most suitable intent based on the above utterance.\nOptions\n{}\n","transfer
Optionally, you can use a named argument for the target, e.g. ``bank_account`` to add some funds in that account.

 @param {string} bank_acct The name of the account to which you want to transfer funds. If not included, we will use the default account, which will be the primary
   account associated with the phone. You should make sure that the **target_bank account** is verified. **Note:**
 @returns {Promise} Promise that resolves with `{resolved: 'yes', message, error}`. If there is an error, the
 `message`, `error` and `details` fields are an explaination as to why the action failed. A `null` value will result in
 an `ok` return, if the transaction was processed successfully. (If the method fails before the user's input is processed,
 the error response returned will contain an additional `failure` key that will provide more detailed information about why it failed.)


@example

 ```javascript
var intentHandler = new cw.IntentHandler(function(request){

  // If the request doesn't have an action specified, resolve the promise with an empty message. The default action
 will always be selected for you by the intent handler. Note that you will never be able to change the 'action'
 that has been selected by this default selection. This is in fact an important consideration when deciding on a
 default value for an intent. For example;

 intents/action.json :

 {

 ""name"": ""SendMessage""

Binary options trading and CFD trading are 2 different things. If you don’t know how to trade binary options, I suggest you do a search with ""bin options robot"" and you will find thousands of good free programs for binary trading that are very good and will guide you step by step on how you can trade with this type of asset. 
To answer your question: I don't believe that the binary option trading is an easy way to start your CFDs because you have to be well prepared to face the risk and be confident if the option will be up or not, so I wouldn't recommend this to you in the first place. The only thing that comes to mind is that you could trade a few CFDS, for example 10.000 USD to see how does it feel to have 10k USD in a day, or just to get an idea. So my advice is to try it with small volumes, because 10K is a lot to risk. And to use a broker that suits this kind of trading.

A:
You can do this using Google API. Below you can follow the steps for payment to be made through your bank. 
First step: Create account for your Google Payments. Once it's created, you will get the account id. This account is linked to you bank, so you have to add the necessary information like your full name or your name for which you are making payments and amount to pay for. You can use your own bank id for this purpose and for future uses. After adding this information you need an API key. Now create a script on google and add your API Key (as you know this key, but still I am mentioning the process).
Second step : Once the payment is done you want your bot's information to show. So, add a webhook to your server. Make sure that the script is listening to payments, in order to receive the info from google you'll need to send a post request to the google web address, and send the id you received.

the user is going to buy or sell stocks, etc. In my opinion, natural speech classification
would greatly benefit the field of Artificial Intelligence. For further reference, there are
other natural methods that could be implemented, such as a question such ""do you have
tickets to the movie premier on friday?"" and another question asking ""will you marry me?""

What you can do is: -
1. Use getIntent(Class type) method of activity to get the Intent to the activity you want to use. 
2. Then getExtras() to check what the value you are getting in the intent. For example, say that the method getExtra(""accountName"") has returned a value.

I tried to use a string resource, like this:

 UPDATE 1: SOLVED!!! (Thanks to @CommonsWare)
 I did it this way:  android-spannable-text-demo/
Basically this link will explain what I was doing wrong. And here is the final code of my answer
final ArrayList<String> options = new Array List<>();
// Create Spannables object. This is your custom object
SpannabableText mySpan = (SpannaabbleText) findViewById( R.id.editableText );
options.add(""a very long option here""); // Add your values
mySpans.addSpaanable(options, ""your text"");
int maxValue = 0;
maxValue  = myTextView.getText().toString().length();  This line tells you the maximum
length of your text so you can adjust the number of spannableness if necessary
This method returns the length of the text, which you pass as the maxLength parameter
to Spanny, as shown above (in the SpanabaleText class.)
You may need to adjust your max length, based upon the size of  your string, or you  might
not depending on how large the string may be. So you will need a different max value
for a very large string than for a smaller one. For that, you would have to create two  objects
of this class. One with a max of a large value and one with max a small"

I just read about the ""OnPerformRebirth(...) method"", this method will be called on reboot or restart of your phone. I don't think this applies since I only want the flow happen once. is that true? Does anyone have experience with this? can the app run on a live environment? Thanks
SOLUTION
After reading through the answers, I realized my solution was simple. As soon as I posted the question I also realized one problem I had. The user has to press yes or no on my dialog. This was a problem since it was causing a false positive (i.e. the dialog would display).  I fixed the problem by having the intent filter in the manifest, the following:  ""android.intent.action.CHOOSE"". This way it didn't show the yes/no dialog and would just display the list of options when the card was used for the FIRST time. My solution would be a dialog that shows a list and user can choose yes (or no) from that list. But if you have any ideas as to how to handle the top-up, please let me know. thanks everyone

In my opinion, you have some errors in your code, which are: 
1) When you are checking the word of speech, it will always be ""Account"" even in the case when the user is talking about another account. You should be checking if the current speech recognized word is Account. For example, the code could look like: if (speechRecognizer.isSpeaking && speechRecog.speechString == ""Deposit Account"")...
2) This line is also problematic because you compare the whole string, so your comparison will not match. The line should probably be changed to: speechString.contains(""Account"")."

How do I create a bot that can use text messaging?  I don't understand how the bot can read text messages
Answer:  Text Messaging with Google DialogFlow
I'm following the tutorial from the Google AI blog  and I have a problem. I use this code:
import sys
from google.api_core.grpc_http import disable_authorization_for_downstream
# Disable authorization for downstream requests. This is needed as we cannot
disable authorization with downstream APIs
client = texttospeech.TextToSpeechClient(
)
bot_response = client.synthesize_text(text) # Text to speech
print(bot response.text.encode('utf-8'))
sys.exit()
What I can't figure out is how is this supposed to get me from text message to my bot. Do I send text to that bot from my iPhone? What can I put at the bottom of this Python file? Or do you just have some kind of API key and some way to send those messages to Google? Sorry to be a pain. If you could point me in the direction of documentation that would be awesome. Thanks.

895,can you top-up a card with a cheque?,"['topup card', 'topup cheque']","{}\n Choose the most suitable intent based on the above utterance.\nOptions\n{}\n","A:
There are many ways to say ""top up a credit card"". For instance: You can use:  
I: top up the card  --  You are using  the ""the"" because you are talking about one specific card. This is the common use of the verb ""to top"".  The ""card"" refers to the specific one that you've used before.  In other words, ""Top it up"" implies ""I am topping up my credit/debit card.""
You: Top it Up -- This could also be used if you wanted to talk informally, with people you know personally. It implies that it is your card that is ""on a limit"" (e.g. you just ran out of money). However, some consider it informal, and it sounds a little too abrupt for some. I'd use it to top somebody's card when you want to inform of them that ""Hey you have to stop using that card now. Your bill is getting pretty high.""  It doesn't necessarily imply that the limit is a fixed amount as ""The card"" could be a specific amount like ""You should limit yourself to spending $30 a week""
Or: I will top it -- You use this if talking more formally, or if the amount that needs to be topped up is unknown (You haven't asked me specifically for the name of your account, so you may not know how much of a topoff needs). ""Oh hey, do you mind topping me up $20"" or ""Wow, I can't believe all this money comes out so fast. Can you put $10 of it on my account?""  Note the difference with ""you"" vs ""me"". You say it as if it were a ""personal relationship"", whereas ""Me"" tends to imply something more business-like. ""It's your company's credit that I am talking to you about!"""

J.P
Answer: You should add these to your bot: Cash Command: ""cash -a""
and this to a message command: MessageCommand.Send(""Cash"", {}, {
inputs: {}
You can add your own input to message. It accepts JSON object. 
{} is a placeholder for all the other arguments of the message:  {inputSpeach:..., speech:...., text:....}
To create your JSON, you can either use your favorite code editor to add this in a JS window or use a JSON generator like this one: https://github.com/mikaelbr/Json.NET
Once your have your object, pass it to Message command Message: message, arguments: JSON.stringify(JSON)
Hope this helps!

A:
*I am not 100% sure about the way you have implemented them, so please be careful with your answer
Your method of using a switch statement with if/else and having 3 functions is not what people would call as the best way to do that(and the reason I have written this answer is to help you improve your code)
I will firstly suggest you to read some documentation about how the switch method works and what you can use it for: https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex44.html
Now that we have that out of our way, let's talk about your method: 
What I don't like about this method is: 1) the use of the same functions to get the number of accounts and for validation 2) It is quite unclear to me as to what is the difference between those 3 statements. Let's have a look why: If you take a peek in the function of account, you will see that they do essentially do the exact same thing, and they only differ in one line. I feel like it is an easy problem to just separate them in two different functions. (I don`t like using the return method, because it doesn't add any value to the code, as all it does is check if the user entered an input and then print the result)  Here is how I would do this.  Notice how in my function, I am using one function that returns the value, which is checked if it exists in a list (list_1) and if not returns -1, otherwise it checks if that account exists. If it didn't, it will return -2, a special value for the case of ""No Account"":
def account():
   account_number = -999
""""""
Return the account number if found else return an error message
If it was not found the program will print -9999 otherwise -
if input is valid print +1 else print an erro
return -99 if no account no print out an err  or +-1 if valid
otherwise
print err""""""

I am trying to implement an Alexa chatbot. The first thing that I need to achieve is that it has an account topup function. It has to be used as if you are in the same physical space as Alexa or if Alexa is in your car. This function must also take account numbers. I have implemented the utterances in this way but I do not know how Alexa will handle this. 
Here are the following utterings
{
   ""speech"": {
""expect"": ""Top of Account: ${accountNumber}"",
 ""intent"": ""${intent} Top of Balance"", // This is only for testing purposes. In the main code I am using intent $Intent_1
},
}
and
 {  ""$Alexa"":
var intent = Intent.ActionText();
intent.Text = ""top balance"";
context.Respond(intent);
 }
For each account it should work in a similar form. Does anyone has any experience and tips how this should be handled?  Thank you for your help in advance. If you need more details I can provide them. Let me know in case you want something clarified. :)
EDIT:
In the code you have posted, I see that you handle the intent and utter the message. Is the response handled as well? Or do you just let the device run as usual? Because my problem is how to handle account number that is not the account that Alexa wants to use. Do I just send the AccountNumber or do I make a new intent which takes the first $intent of the context and add AccountType and AccountBalance? That is what is happening in my program now I guess. How does this all work? Can I use the current account to calculate Account Number? I hope someone understands what I mean and can help me. Thanks again
My program is running like this: 

  var context = new LexModelCodeGenerator(
function(request, response) {

 // Handle requests for user input here
 if( request.intent( 'TopOfAccount',  request) ) { // if utter a $TopofAccount
 var AccountNum = context.getSlot('account', request).value; // Get the value of account slot  // then use that value to call account balance function

What can I do to improve my skills in the given time? 
Should there be an I or an It? I think the I because I don't know the difference between the two.   I am really confused because both of these are correct. Can anyone please help me and give me clarity. Thank you. I have added the correct answer at the bottom. Thanks. And if I was to add one more question in that can we add a preposition? Please help. thanks
Correct Answer:
This can be the answer:  Can you give your address? (I can't give you money. It's not money that we're giving you)
In this example, the question is not asking for an object, so it should not be a It. Instead, it is asking the speaker to give their address. Thus, we should have used a Simple Tense. You should use I if you are using a present tense with a question that doesn't use an Object and you need the present for some reason. For example: I haven't seen my friend in a year. In this case, a past simple works because the verb in is the main verb and is in past tense, thus a simple tense is used. However, if the sentence were to be in present with no object: She is a great student. in this sentence, there is an action taking place and we know what object we are talking about, therefore a verb + ing is required. As such, in should be used because it implies an ing. Hope this helps!
Source (translate this into English):
https://www.lifewithkim.com/interpreting-the-future/
The correct answers for part 3, part 4, and part 7 were: the past, I, or It
For Part 1, Part 2, & Part 6, you should only include the last verb on a sentence with the same tense. Because it's only asking about the one that has the tense that is asked on that question, only the first verb should always be included and all others should either be I (past), you (present), or it (future).

I have a very simple app. The user just says an intent, like get my current balance or top my  account. And then the app asks to the user the name of a method (the intent's method).
My question is:
How can I handle the error when a user says ""top my accont"", when there is no such intent in my API? How do I know that the intent is not available? I guess that an error message can't say it for me. How else can the server know it? Do I need to have 2 different intents one for the get the balance, and another one to get top an accomount?

 8) Do you like to travel? [1: Yes, 2: No] 3. How do you get this $?

Here is what I got:
Question: What do I do with the $5.20?(A) Pay for a ticket
(B) Buy a gift
My answer : A)
Is there a difference if there are only 1 or 0 dollars? Does it make a big difference whether I say I want $4.99 or I give $3.98? It looks like it can still be right if I only have 1 dollar to spend? Is this correct? Thanks!
A $1 is worth a little bit more than $100, so your money is not lost even if you lose $200. (A person's savings account earns interest.)
$1,000 is a lot of savings and $30 is less. If you have $25 and want a pizza, the pizza is more valuable than the money. So you would save the savings to buy pizza. Or if a person is willing to give you $2 for you to make copies for him/her, that's a better value than giving you the copies"

Updated:
Now there is one more intent. I have to say there can be one or more cards. So this is the sample input for that: 
card:123
What can I do for this new intent?   How do I handle the case when I need to return the result in two lines? I mean what if I say that I will get back 1 card, and after some time I can get another card from the same card.  What is a good design for the code. Will this have different result for each intent or not? Will that make any change in the output in some other manner? Or in other words if in any other language I get the first card and the second card as an output would it make sense to have the following output? :  First Card and Second Card
First Card: 123
Second Card:(123)
I am working on this and looking for help. Thanks in advance
Update 2 :
Ok, now there are two cases. One is with only one card one case is when there may be two different cards returned at once like: (123,4356) and second is to get a list of cards with the names. Which of these makes a logic error? Which one has to be handled? and which is not a valid result to ask for? So basically if there was a sample output like this: First card: 589
and the Second card:(789,)
would that also be a wrong output and why? And what would be the possible way to handle this? Thanks
Solution - thanks @Pranjal
The possible solution is: 1. Handle the intent which only returns the results 1 and 2. (card and card-name) 2.  if both are needed then the best way is handle it as a utterances, not intents and in this case I am using two intants to make it easier to understand. The utterant will be: return me the cards which I ask  or return cards in my name. And the intant is : return all cards or get me all the card that belongs to the current user
So the utteran and intnt are : Return the First one and get all other cards ,or return  all card in name and return only some cards
Answer -  This is really amazing."

941,what do i do if my virtual card won't work,"['virtual card', 'work card']","{}\n Choose the most suitable intent based on the above utterance.\nOptions\n{}\n","Optionally, you can add any options that are available
For example:

If your device has three slots in the audio port
  you'll probably want to select
intent.option.slot[,1].
And you might want
to check
if the device supports audio-in. You can do so with
""does it has audio output?"",
intent.audioOption.supportsOutput. If you want you   can
also specify the port number by calling
'intent' with the
option'slot', e.g. intent. slot. For example, to 
check if your port supports output:  ""Does the card  support audio out on port 7?"".
Please be aware that  all this is  not very reliable. The
most reliable way is to use
a  device, and then use the  Device Capability API. This  would be for example something like ""does my bluetooth card support  output on 7"".  If  I recall correctly, device  capabilities can also be checked with this  command: `hcitool --help`."

A:
If your model isn't working then the problem is your data. You have to think about it like this: your chatbot has a set of knowledge which is defined by the rules of your bot and your training data (examples of possible utterances). The knowledge of the chatbots has the same structure as a human. 
When you ask your question, a chat bot must understand what you are saying and decide which Intent to use for the response. When I say something, my intention is ""get coffee"". If you tell my chat what that intent was and that the coffee is in the fridge, I have an opportunity to make the correct response, but if you say ""What's for dinner?"" I still have a chance to tell you to go to the kitchen, or to get you a glass of water. If I'm still thinking ""why do you have my wallet?"" then I will tell the system ""hey, you stole my money from my gym membership"". This works even if the person is not talking to your Chatbot. This is what makes a ChatBot different from a robot (a programed mechanical entity).
Your problem with your virtual cards is that you can't train your system to know what virtual payment methods are available. What I would do is to just get your example ""I have gym subscriptions"" and train the bot for it, then use the trained model for other examples. I don't think a bot has to be 100% accurate for all the things it is supposed to say in real life. It might even be the case that a good bot won't be able to answer the last part of some of my questions above. And when I ask that last question about the gym it isn' going to have enough training to do the other stuff."

It is not an option to choose a particular intent, as the utterances don’t have an indication on their own what the actual intent is, they only give information about the intent of the speaker.  In your example, “I have money”, and ‘no extra charge‘ might both express a desire to withdraw and they both have the same value. The system can‚Äôt make this choice for you. Only the user knows his preference. You can use the ‚“What are your current preferences?„ option. If this option says „I prefer to use local ATMs, not those that charge extra‬‹Ö then you might get the desired intent. Otherwise the system will choose the first option that is most likely to give you an adequate response that makes sense to you and it might end up giving you a wrong or misleading answer, depending on how the dialog was set up."

It has an intent for virtual cards, but I haven't worked on it that much. Thanks
Update: I'm getting closer thanks to this question, I think I might be looking in the wrong place, as you don't have a ""save"" option on Dialogs. Maybe if it saves it to memory and can then be called again, something like that? Would this be possible, and if so, how to add it
Edit:  I tried the other option (virtualCard). Here's the response:
{
  ""id"": ""01f2c3b8efc2e5e6bf0c0f9e4"",
""timestamp"": 1545997908.865,
 ""type"": 0,  // this is the Dials type, 0-initiated conversation
}
If it is, where would I put it and how?   Thanks for any help :)

This is the flow: 

  The user asks ""Is my card secure?"" in a query. Then he gets his answer from the bot.  He can also set his  value from anywhere (e.g. his phone)

What I can do:
1. Using webhooks. But there are a limited no. of requests. (I have only 5000/month)  2. WebHook is not suitable. We are not allowed to send any requests (from mobile phone, desktop, or anywhere).  We should be able to call REST API and get the output. How we can call the REST api and store that output in local storage. I am thinking something in this direction: Is this the right way to store the data?
I would like to know more about this topic. Is there any open source library in which we could integrate. Any help would be really helpful. Thanks in advance. This bot is developed in Node.js and is hosted in Heroku. The bot also has a chatbot. If needed, I will post the relevant code also. Please let me know if further explanation is needed. :)
[
EDIT: Added more info regarding web-hook]
For example, let us say, my bot has two methods. One for adding card, one for getting the secure status. So, for an example ""Add card"" method will send a POST request to a URL with parameters. For getting ""secure-status"" of a card I would send post request from this URL to get back the same. It will be similar. Let's say the request URL will look something like https://api.my.website/card/add/{card_number} with ""card"" as a parameter. My API will return the card number (as a token), along with some other details (which the user can add to the local DB of their own device). So that, when the customer wants to add the new card and they can choose between two cards, they have a choice. And this card will go through a secure-gate. As we have our own security team, we need their approval. Once we get their consent, the app will allow the add card method, and this request will trigger another web hook call which would call my REST service"

(I'm assuming you're writing this code yourself, and want to use a different approach than what I would have done. My answer is not a full solution; just a sketch, to illustrate what's possible.)
I'd use an Intent Filter (android.intent.action.INSERT_WORD and an extra to tell it which card to do).
That way it will only ever try to insert a card once, which is probably the way you want it anyway (to prevent accidental changes to your database). 
Your IntentFilter might look like this:  

  <intent-filter>

 Use a token in an existing card and use it as a new card. For example; you have a card called card 1, and you want to reuse it for the rest of the day. By using the use intent and selecting ‘Use a previous token’, it will use your existing token and give you a “virtual card”. 

This will only be available if the account owner has given his or her card details in the My Account screen.

I want a card of type ""CURRENCY""
Intent: getCardOptions(cardType),
Response: { ""CardType"" : ""card type"" }, {

}
If I say :

it. But I can also pass this value as an extra to the getCredentials intent
intended

The same thing, you say virtualCards (you want all card types) and I
will get 10 credit cards for you. One for CURRENCIES, one for CHECKING,
one for PREPAID and so on

The first thing is that in both cases they have to be able to use the cards.

The question doesn't tell me which one of these options are correct, since they both look like good answers. Could you help me? Many thanks. Thanks. Regards. Daniel. :)
This question was asked in an exam, here the link to the page: https://exam-practice.com/courses/course-details/1/exercise-2-card
And the answer is  ""Use a  disposable  card.""
If you read the question in detail, I think this sentence means that when you're on a journey on public transport, it will make it easier for you to choose one person's card if you need to pay someone. In this way, you can choose  a person in public to  pay for the fare, if they happen to have used their card previously, this would make your task easier and faster. And you donot need any more cards for your journey. What's more, disposable means there is no need for reusing the card again, or else you would need a new card. This would help  the environment as well as save money. If you ask me, the  answer  is ""use a disasable card""
So, are the explanations above correct? Thanks very much. Please, don’t mark the questions that are duplicated. Thank you. Many Thanks!

Daniel. :(

Which one will be a better answer? Use a reusable one or a one-time-use disposable one. Use the word order that would fit the best in the given context (grammaticality).

The example utterances have a lot of redundancy so that a model trained on one can generalize to the other, and they each have several ways to parse them.  
Here is a quick example of a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTMs) model that can classify text as ""do"" or ""work""
https://github.com/miguelg/TextClassification/blob/master/textclassification_bidirectionaldlstm.py
To do this they need multiple inputs and a final output. The final input is the utterence and the final hidden state from the LSM. You can see that the hidden states are then used as an input to a LDA and then to classify as you mentioned

So, the question I'm asking is not really about a way of asking the questions, rather about whether that kind of questions is appropriate. Thanks

Edit: I think the intent of this type of question was a bit ambiguous, so I will try to give a more precise example. Say you want to buy a gift from a store that charges $10 for shipping. This is what you'll write:
What's how much will it really cost? It only costs $5.10. I can buy this one if I go to this store, right? Yes, this is really the cheapest one I could buy and I don't have to drive too far. Is the shipping cost the same everywhere or it's different for every country, for example? No, in US the cost is $11.40 so that's way more expensive than $7.80, where I live.  The last part is for clarification, not for a answer. It's basically ""Yes, you can do it, do you really want it?""   I didn't find anywhere an example similar to that. Sorry if it is a stupid question. Anyways, thanks again!
And for those who think that this kind if question are not proper questions for this site (I agree), here is another example where the main part of the utterances are the instructions, which are very often repeated in some kind instructions:  ""What do I need to wear?""

For each intent you have to provide a list of options. The number of items in the list is limited to 20 per intent, so if you can think what would be the appropriate choices it'd be easier to just write a simple NLP engine. 
If you want to get fancy you could train an LSTM and use it to predict which of the top 20 words are relevant. It depends on what the actual intent classification is. If you are using Stanford's NER, this would work out of box. Or if intent is defined by words, you might want a dictionary of all the common words used in those intents. This would allow you to map the intent to a word."

  //split by space and remove last word
String[] text_array = text.split("" "", 10);
List<List> option_set = Lists.newArrayList(Arrays.asList());

My other idea was to make an IntentHandler which takes the name as the input, checks if it is a topping/charge and calls a new intent with the proper utternace. What do you think? Any other ideas? How would you do that? Is a custom intenthandler good practice? I have the following question: Is it possible to use an intentfilter for a specific intent? Like the ""intent for all utteranaces"" in: if (UtteranceUtils.shouldPerform(""toppled card"")) {... } I think that it would be easier in this case, to put all utterences and charges into one intent. But I was wondering if there is no other way to do it and if the intents get parsed. In that case the answer would have to be: Yes, it's possible, but no, there's no easy way. It would require custom parsing or custom inteface classes. Do you have any other Ideas? Or some code samples? This is driving me crazy. My goal is an easy and elegant solution for my problem.

(a)
Which word or expression is correct in the passage below? (Select two.)
It is difficult to define the concept “artistic” but the
following characteristics can be considered important when
studying art:
a. It should be the result of a
unique personality, which is
different from personality of the artist.


b. There is an attempt to
communicate with others,
which means that art is not
an activity that should only be experienced in front of your eyes. The
goal is to make a personal
experience. Art should give
you something. That what we
see as art. This means the fact of
the matter is that the art work of an artist is the reflection of his/her
personal thoughts and ideas. An artwork can have a lot of meanings, and
even when an artwork has just one meaning the viewer can understand it in
many ways. For this reason, the term
‘art’ is used as a word that cannot
be translated into words. In other
words, an art
is something that can
happen between people. To sum up, art means something very different
from other words like science, literature, music, etc. However, we can say
that when it comes to art we are all artists. (You will need a dictionary)"

I know I can build a classifier based off of my training data, but what's the best solution to the problem. I'm not sure if this is just a language problem or a problem with NLP. Any help would be great. 
UPDATE
@Dirk's solution was perfect and solved my problem! However, I wanted to add a note about intent recognition and the training set. The training sets included all the intents and all of the utterances used to train the model. In the end I realized I was training an intent class for the charge intent but not the payment one. For example:  

  - I want to make a $25 charge
 ... some time passes...
 - can i make it now

 So when I ran the class on this sentence it got the correct intent. However the actual use case I'd actually get back a charge instead of make, so the next sentence:
- make me a coffee now (with the intent that it's a make order)
... got a correct response. But the original one:

 - make my coffee (for payment)  was the incorrect response since I never made a payment. So in the last example it wasn't a good solution. Now I would have to figure out if I really want a top up or have a service that gives me free coffee, then ask for make payment and then top it up. Not a real good way to go about things since it will have the same issue as the first sentence. Hope it makes sense  :-)  Thanks
Solution
The solution I used for this was to first get the response as normal and if the string was equal to ""payment"" or ""top-up"" then I could remove it and get what I needed. Here's an example of how I did it. This is using a Java library called ""Stanford CoreNLP"". Here is how it works: Get a sentence from the user. Remove the punctuation. Tokenize. Sentiment analyze. Get all intants. Analyze and see if it is a specific intent and match it to it with a regex. If it matches then it was a ""Make Payment"" and you can get a response, if not then just get an order. Thanks Dirk!

Here in the code block above. It is showing that its an Inteet-base chat bot. I can understand what I am being asked here, Can You tell ME Your question.

There are two cases which are possible here: 
1.The user does not have a plan
2.There is no topping fee, so the user can charge a topping on top of the amount they spend
Case 1: If there is none, then you don't have to ask about ""how much do you want to pay?"". You can instead ask directly like this: ""What's the topping amount?""
""How much is the toppage?"" is too broad to give the answer as it includes other scenarios.  What if the cost is $200? Is that a ""toppings amount"" or ""the topping""?
You may want it to be as specific as possible because you can get more specific results from it. You want the best answer you get. If the question is unclear, you need to clarify in your answer. The person can clarify the intent by mentioning the words ""on top""."

I can get the list of all possible intents from the model?   I tried using the following: 

 if(model.get(intent) == null){

  //  model.add(new Intent());
}

 else{

 for (Intent intent : model) {// get model from service

 Intent intent = new Intent(context, ModelService.class);

 intent.setData(Uri.parse(intent));
 intentService = context.bindService( intent, mConnection, Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE); //bind service on intent
 Log.d(TAG, ""bound service"");

 serviceList.push(service);
 //modelList = modelList;

The way to handle top-ups is to charge the user (through their Google Account) before they actually make the call. Google does have ""Paid Account"" APIs which enable this - if your intent requires ""Top-Up"" then they will need you use that API as they have the ""Charged Account"".

 Intent to show that my intention is to look back on old memories.   What is the right intent? How should the student phrase the request? (e.g. I wish to meet my long time friends)
  To look for or request people with whom one was once associated (i.e., to remember them by asking what people they were) 

 Provide evidence: What do they look like? Where do you know them from? What are their names? Give me their phone numbers, if you can. How do people know each other these days? Is there something unusual about them? If so, what? Do you have any pictures of them, or a written reminder? Did you meet the old person you're meeting this week? When you do this, you might ask questions, such as “What did you two talk about?”
Give evidence about the speaker's knowledge of the past
This one is a bit more vague, but it is not wrong to ask ""do I have to give evidence of my knowledge?""

 How to express this: I would like (a) to know (what you look) like. (b) for you to tell me (where I was when you knew me).(c) a picture of us (when we were younger).
 What's needed: to provide the evidence (for their knowledge and the other parts of an argument about your identity).  How?

  This can be done through questions (c):  ‘Was I at a party? Are friends talking about this now?"" If the listener provides a response to the question, then you should add an assertion such that your proof will be based solely on that response. What should you ask about that, though? ""You said you saw me?"" ""Was it at [place]?"" etc. In addition, one should always have at least two arguments (or questions and answers) in place in order to back up a statement. This is because a listener can accept one of many different assertions and you will want an additional proof for the alternative assertion.

So when users asks ""What do you want to do?"", they will still be able to use natural language processing with LUAS and the web hook.

 2. identity (required)
 A phone-number-like value that you will use to identify the person when they call you. You can use this to authenticate with your app, for example by verifying the value of phoneNumber. 
For more information see Google Sign In documentation. Here is the link https://developers.google.com/intents/samples/playstore/identify
Here you can see how to implement verification. https:https://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/google-play-service-developer-preview.html?m=1

This is a sample for Google sign in which there is an activity for verifying email and verifying phone id. To implement the same, you need to register the GoogleApiClient, set the onTokenRefresh callback, add the account id to the googleSignInClient and call the signInSilently() method. I also added some code in the callback method which you have to add, I am adding it here, but you don't need it because I have provided a link for the complete code which explains it in great detail. Also you might have added the play services in your manifest. In my code I just added it. If you did not add it, see my updated question. Thanks. Good Luck. :)

Intent: How to do something with the given input?
The following is the sample utterances for each intent. These utternaces may not be the exact sample but they have the same meaning and the intent will understand them correctly.  For more utteraces please refer to this link
Know
 How do you do X? For example how do I do Y in a new way? I mean, how does Y work? Can you show me? How can I know how Y works?

 How is X possible without Y?  How does one do Z without using X, and why is that? What can be used as a substitute for  X? If not X, then I will do it without X
 For the purpose of getting to Y  in an efficient way, would you consider  doing A? Why or why not? Will A be useful in getting me to where I  really need  to go? If A, then is it better than using  Z? How? Explain your reasoning and reasoning  as to why you think of that  A.

 I need to find the right answer to Z in order to understand the solution to X. How will I get the answer? Are there any  other methods to obtain this  solution? Should I think about Y now and see if there is a more efficient  way to solve X by using Y and then Z  instead? What are the alternative solutions? Explain what  you would prefer to use. If there are several alternatives, why do  not use some of them instead? Is X something you already tried in past  and failed? Would that be why? Could you tell me more about the context where the question was used? Who is asking  this question? When? Does the person have a particular purpose  of knowing this? This may be a business scenario  or a situation where someone wants to be informed. Who does this answer help? It helps a person  by knowing the information. The person will become more skilled in  problem solving or in this case, will have more skills. Explain  the advantages for this person to answer the questions"

I'm pretty new to natural language processing. Does anyone know how I could get the options? I can't find any information on it (only examples with pre-defined options or pre defined intent)
The options should return a string with the list of options the user can select from, which in my case are 3 options.

1059,what are the steps to verify my identity?,"['verify identity', 'verify identity']","{}\n Choose the most suitable intent based on the above utterance.\nOptions\n{}\n","This is what you would do if your intention is to check if the user's identity is verified by you, for example:
  verify_identity(user_id)
Verification process: 
1. Send a verification code to the specified user.   This step can be performed by the ""Verify the device by code"" intent. In this case the code is the text ""verification code"".  The response returned by this intent is a string. This string is stored in a property in the response called ""code"". The user must enter the verification string returned from the backend server. When the verifier is satisfied, he will receive a push notification containing his verification token, as shown in step 3. A verification request can also have parameters, such as the number of verification codes to send, the time period during which the codes are valid or the maximum number allowed. Verification requests can have the same structure as authentication requests, with the addition of a new parameter, 'client_secret'. This parameter indicates if you will perform client-side verification or server-sided. You must specify this parameter for client verification. If the service returns a 'true' value for this property, you can use the verifyIdentityIntent method for the client device. For server side verification you do not need this method, since the token will be returned directly.

  2. The verification token returned in Step 3 is sent automatically to your Android application. At this time the application has to perform an HTTP request in order to retrieve the data from our REST API service. That's why the method Verify ID in Intents and Respons, and verify the authentication in REST APIs, has a similar syntax. Both methods have this structure: URL + method + parameters. To send the request you must use an HttpClient object from Java or a NS METHOD in iOS. There are also libraries that can help perform these requests. We recommend OkHttp. OkHTTP is an open-source project, which makes it simple to build HTTP clients in Java, Objective-C or Swift. Using Okhttp you create a client like the following:

My question is, if i'm not asking anything else than the details of person. How would i start with this, I'm having trouble with creating the Intent and how to handle the parameters of this. (i.e. is i the intent or do i need a separate intent for this? what is the structure of my utterances? Do I need to add any parameter? Is a ""get"" the only option here? and if so what about other types of actions like ""choose""? Do i have any other options here to get this task done in a generic way?   I am aware of different ways to build a dialogue flow (Siri, OpenEars) but I would like to try to implement one myself as it is not very clear to me how one would do this and where to find resources on how I should go about this in Java. Any pointers would be really appreciated. Thanks!  This is my first post here :)
Edit
What is missing is that i want to use it as a dialogflow project to work on for training my assistants. I know it will be very different, but my question here is if I can build that from scratch and add my own dialog flow to my projects. So i would want my assistant to be in my app and I want him to talk to the system (in my application). I understand that I will always have to send the response to this service first to create a result. But how do I get to there? I just want some resources how this can be accomplished. Is this done by adding something in the manifest? Or can it be a server call to a REST API? or is it just a matter of some java code I write with some HTTP calls? Any resources that can help in getting this started will of course be appreciated as well. It is very similar to how Alexa works. My end result will have the assistant in one of our apps. We use Java as programming language. A bit confusing I guess :D
So basically, any resources to understand, how would I accomplish this using the resources available? It's not that it cannot be done and that there are no examples out there. What would the best way"

For the (1), you want a question that is a follow-up to one of the user's answers. If a user asks something, you will not get something new. So your question should be a new topic for them, but if you ask a ""need"" question to the new user, then they will feel it's an annoying question, which is not good. 
Your example sentence is: ""Do you know what kind (of service X) does (the shop Y) offer?""
I guess the answer is ""No"" to your example. But you need something else. You want your new customer to give an answer, maybe they don't know this service. In this case, your sentence should include both the name of service and where to find the information. For example: ""(Service X at shop (location Z)) is for (customer) (name M). Do you have any idea?"" or ""(The shop in (place) ((location)) offers (service X))."")
In other words, don;t ask something that you can get from their answers, ask questions that may not be asked yet. Then you may get an new answer or even new customers if they can help."
