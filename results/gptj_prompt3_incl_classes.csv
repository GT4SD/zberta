What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","Given a user profile: the profile contains all the information needed to answer the question: what are the exchange rate of the US Dollar.
The profile has to be complete in order to provide the most relevant answer. (for more information on profile construction see the profiles sub-section of our wiki)
How the system is supposed to classify the different intents? Which are some good examples of classification of different intent types for this utterances? (I'm looking for some examples or some information in this regard) I need some inspiration and hints on how to do it.  
What is our current approach? I know there is a document on this topic, but I have not yet been able to find it (and I would like to see how our team works to implement something like this) .
Thanks a lot!
PS: I'm not looking forward for the solution, rather, what we have done in the past (e.g. to use a single intent) and how it was done. I am asking about a ""best practice"" approach. As you can tell, it's an open ended question. Thank you again for any information
UPDATE: To clarify, I was looking how the intent was classified on the basis of an utteranc:
I need the rate to buy a house in Mexico. How much it will cost me to rent? and I got the same response (exchange rate) for both intets: Know rates and know rate: The question is which one of them is relevant? This should be done using the ""profile"" of each utterant, so that the one that fits best could be answered. If we don't consider the previous information, we'll get the wrong one. In other words, how do you ""match"" the right intent with a relevant utteration? It's like a fuzzy match, where the user might say a similar utterace to the original but in some cases they could even be wrong. We can't ask him what he really meant, because we can see that it could not be the response for his intent. The goal is to select the correct intent for a specific utterce. Thanks again!!

1,what exchange rates do you offer?,"['exchange rates', 'offer rates']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","There can be multiple possible answers, which can depend on the context, the domain and the knowledge base available to the system in that context.
For example, for the sentence ""What rates are you offering?"" the intent could be ""Offer rates"" or ""offering rates"". However, we can imagine that in the business context we have, one person may know only about offer and another one about both offer + offering. That is, in an application domain, multiple intents may apply depending on user knowledge, experience or domain. This is a problem in current NLP systems. In fact, NDCG is based on a single intent classification. For a system to work in this scenario it will require different approaches. One of those approaches is to use different classifiers per intent or use a hierarchical classifier to distinguish different intensions."

UPDATE:
Forgive my language as I do not speak proper English :( This is probably the most confusing question I've ever seen. The question as written by me is: Can I put these two sentences together: 
""You guys use where on you get the rate?"" (I.e. You use on when asking a question)  and ""I think the natural one would be to get. But what's the appropriate way to form this sentence?""  The way I wrote this I thought ""do you use"" meant ""you use"", but maybe it's not right. If this was right, it would have been this: ""Do you where to the get rate, for example.""
Please tell me what you think, thanks!   (It might not be right to have an ""to get"" in it in this context because I think ""the rate"" here is what is being acquired, not what they're doing to acquire) :)
Note 2: I understand that it is possible to say where you acquire the things from as long as the word you do acquire it from is not part of the sentence. I only want help on sentences that have both parts of where and to where (or where/to where).

Should there even be such an intent at all? Does the answer to the first part of this question have any bearing on intent? If not, how is this distinction made? For me, the only difference is that with how to exchange money i can use any of the 3 words in the question, while exchange currency, i cannot, hence the use of rate here (i feel this is wrong?).

A:
[Disclaimer : I'm not a lawyer. You should always consult a qualified attorney regarding your contracts / agreements with other parties. And never use a service without having read and understanding every line of their terms.]
From the perspective of contracts, it may be better to treat exchange_rate as a noun and not an action: you cannot exchange currencies without a rate, but you can exchange goods and services without mentioning it's exchange-ness.
The way I understand it, you want to get paid in dollars with euros. In this case, what you probably want is to find a company willing to pay dollars for euros with a specific rate (you can ask for the rate on the phone by calling them).
Your contract will include these lines :   ""We are going to deliver X for you and we will charge your business Y in euros, in case it is acceptable to both parties in writing. If you are not able to provide any specific business terms, we are willing and able as well.""
If you find that a particular company only wants to do business with your company as long as they don't have to deal with exchange rates, then you should specify in your agreement that they will have the freedom to choose their payment provider. This should protect you at least in cases where something goes wrong, and your service provider gets sued."
5,what are your international exchange rates?,"['exchange rates', 'international rates', ' rates']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","Which is correct? I can only assume the second one because international is what it means.
However, I'm not sure if that's what you were asking.  I will add a bit more to what I already said above:
International is a very generic term, like the term 'currency' is very general. In fact it may not even be the most fitting term to talk about this at all. This is because what we usually refer to (when thinking about currencies) as 'international exchange' are just exchanges between currency. They are actually called 'cross currency transactions'. What we normally call 'inter-national exchange rate' (ie. the currency you can exchange your money for at a foreign bank or at the local bureau de change) are in fact 'exchange rates' between the domestic currency and a currency of a country. (A currency is also a term that is used in this context, although most people tend to use the 'local' version for their 'home currency' and the name of the country's currency as the generic name for the other currencies they're interested in.)
So what the question is really asking is if the phrase 'International exchange (rate)' has another term or meaning. I think that would be 'a currency exchange'.  (This is probably the least confusing version of that question)"
6,how often do your exchange rates change,"['exchange rates', 'change rates']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","In this question, I'm wondering if it would make sense to use ""Exchange rates"" in place of the more specific phrase and whether it makes sense for the phrase or any of its subcategorizations in context.
The reason I think this is interesting is because I feel like the use of ""exchange rate"" implies that a change in ""rate"" occurs. However, in the specific context of this scenario, a person's exchange rate will not be changing, and instead may be a constant. 
My main concern is that the phrasing of a statement may depend on the meaning intended. For example, what if in another example: ""I think that he's the most beautiful thing that I've seen"" the speaker was actually referring to a man, but he was thinking of women and was trying to be complimentary. Would it make logical sense in this case to say ""How often does the man's beauty change""? I am unsure if my question really makes any sense. Any help or feedback would be great. I hope my issue is understandable and clear. Please let me know if its not. Also let know how I can improve this. Thanks for reading my post. Cheers! :)
I am using ""change"" to mean a permanent change, or in other words, ""he's still beautiful"".

You can't advise ""the"" exchange. Exchange ratio is not an exchange, or ratio at least. ""The"" is singular, so there is only one exchange (of something) - but a ratio could be exchanged as the ratio of one thing to another.
So you are not advised. You are advised a rate, an amount or something like that

8,how are exchange rates calculated?,"['exchange rates', 'calculated rates']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","A:
.
How are Exchange Rates calculated? The basic answer here is :
The exchange rate is calculated with the help of a weighted average formula.  
To be exact the exchange is given as the ratio of the sum of purchasing power parity exchange and the average of trade weights. Here  is based on Purchasing Pouind parity and is obtained by dividing the purchasing value of an object with its current price. For example a pair of shoes is valued $100 in US dollars, so it has purchasing price parity with 100$. Then the price of this pair is $20 which is a third of $60 (current price) so the PPP exchange would be $\frac{100}{20}=5. So this ratio is used to calculate the rate of change. If this is done for every item of export or import, then the weighted avg would result in the correct exchange value. This is not exactly what happens to be done, but what I've explained is basically what is being done. See this site for better details."

Edit: I am going from the exchange-of-currency-pairs perspective, not the ""exchange"" or ""rate"" per se. Thanks again. Edit #2: What I meant was an exchange of two currencies, with two parties, where one says ""these are based, and these are the rates"", and where they are ""Based on"" some criteria and ""Rate of X to Y"".
This is in the context of the phrase ""The rates of one currency in relation to the other currency are""
Which is an example of: ""the rates... are"", which is what we're talking around. We're just wondering which of multiple, possible, bases a rate/exchangerate could use. If there are any others, or if they would be wrong, I'll be happy to learn! I'm asking which one makes the most sense or which would work the least amount-wise in a business context. I'd like to understand the difference. Thank you. My guess is that it is either a) they both mean to base it on something and are talking past each other, because if either one means ""to base something on"", the meaning of ""on"" seems to be a little vague. Or maybe it's b) based exchange is a verb/transitive/verb/object. In any case, thanks!

The first and second utterances seem to indicate an interest in exchange, but I've never been able to fully settle on a coherent interpretation: are they asking for the rate (i.e. the value of $100,000, divided by $10), or about the exchange of money to foreign currency?
I have a pretty good sense of how I should interpret the third utterant, which seems to ask ""what are the rates"", but the first two examples throw me off.
Edit: The original problem was to decide between the intended meaning of ""exchange"" and that of the verb ""rates"" in the context of asking people to define the term. I was thinking of it in terms of whether the correct subject for ""What are rates?"" is ""rate"" or ""money"".

What are some of the common uses of ""current rates"" in English? What are others? 
I'm also interested in the use in contexts similar to this: in a given situation, are we using past rates (for something that has been completed already), in which case ""rates current"" is correct and ""exchange rates"", as ""what rates are exchanged?"" isn't, or future rates (""rates to be exchanged""), in either case.
Are there examples of either ""rat"" or ""rate"" used with the sense of a rate of exchange of something? (I assume that's not the case with an exchange rate, as the rate would be a ratio between two quantities and not a quantity itself?) What would the ratio mean? Would an appropriate answer be ""the rate at which a commodity is exchanged on the open market"" - I don't know if this is really correct, even if it is a common usage of this term. I also found something about what might be the equivalent in French, which I'm not sure how I would interpret in this context, especially as a verb.  Any advice about all of these, thanks. (As an interesting aside, I wonder if there isnít an even more complicated answer to my question.)
Edit: Thanks for the answers, they've been really helpful - especially the ones from @Rory. As an afterthought, does this question cover the possible ambiguity of using ""an exchange"" with either the verb ""to exchange"", the noun ""trade"" and the plural ""trades"".  The first example seems more common in all three contexts. For example, the question: ""What is an important economic factor that can affect exchange?"" could be answered with ""Exchanges"".
Thanks. Again. :)
Also as an aside for anyone reading the comments: as noted, it's an extremely common mistake and is usually made because they want something to sound more complex, like ""The current rate is $X, while the exchange is currently at $Y, so..."". But it should always be understood as referring to what the prices, and what they're being exchanged for.

Intent inference has been shown to be effective in a wide range of NLP applications including text generation, information extraction as well as dialog management, question answering, and text-to-speech synthesis. A natural approach to inferring the intent is to use supervised machine learning algorithms trained by hand-annotated text data. The supervised model will be trained to predict one or more intent classes from an input sequence, while each input instance is described by the sequence of word and sentence types. In this work, we propose an unsupervised approach for the same task.
We have built a knowledge base of the main concepts involved in the text understanding task, like currency, exchange rate, location, etc. We use these concepts, together with a semantic parser for English, for creating a domain ontology. Each concept is represented by a concept node linked to a set of concept attributes. Concepts and attribute are associated by concept and concept types in order to capture knowledge about the relation among them. Moreover the ontological structure is modelled using a directed graph. This framework allows an ontologic reasoner for infer the most appropriate intents given an utterances sequence. Using this ontolog, the proposed system can predict the correct intension from a user utternace by analyzing the context of utteration and the semantic relations with the available concepts. Our system is designed with three main components: a linguistic parser, a lexicon for currency concepts and a search engine for concepts that allows fast queries with ontologically derived constraints. These components allow the system to automatically identify and select the domain concepts in an appropriate context. With this framework, our model was tested on three corpora in English. Results are compared with state-of-the-art systems."

It would be interesting to know if a survey of the market can determine the correct, and, of course, the most appropriate answer to this question.
This survey would also be an interesting one, for example, on a country specific level. 
I think there are two ways of finding out whether exchange-rates are based  on rates-exchange, or the other way round. One of them might be, as a rule of thumb, to ask the question ""Are exchange(r) rates based upon the rates(s) of (a) exchange?"", as, e.g., in ""What is your base rate?"".
The answers to such a question are not always obvious. E.i. the word ""ex"" in rates of exchange (as well as in other contexts) does not necessarily point towards rate(n)xrate(p).
As an example the German Bundesbank's website says: ""The exchange value (i) is determined by the current rates (ii)"". This statement is a very common one. It might not really be a general rule for all currencies. I would say it is, more or less, true, in most currencies - if there is no currency devaluation. Of course exchange and rates are related but not the same. The Bundesbanks definition suggests to me that, at least in principle, one can exchange a currency at a specific rates at different time. This does seem to be the main point. Rates are usually a consequence/output of an exchange - but, they are also a basis for the valuation of money (or a certain amount of it) at certain time and (usually) in certain circumstances or situations. In principle there can be different rates for a single currency. If you exchange, say, 100€ to pounds, but with a rate at which you could trade the pounds in for an equal amount in euro's, it would not be ""based on the (actual) euro rate"".
A good way to think about exchange in general is to imagine a black box, which has a slot for currency 1, a different slot with currency 2 and some switches. Currency 1 is then inserted into the blackbox and a number of switches are switched, thus resulting in currency2 being inserted in place of currency1 in"

25,how much will i get with the exchange rate?,"['exchange rate', 'get rate']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","or get exchange rates?

A:
determining the right answer
Given how little is stated we have to infer the meaning of a statement that contains the word exchange (or equivalent) and how to get, the question is not clear. 
If i is going to be used as an infinitive (will), the answer can be determined using the simple rules of infinitives (see also here - this part seems not to apply, as there is no main verb in the inflected forms of get):
Get + [Noun] inf. = To get [noun].
The infix will in this case makes no difference to the interpretation of the sentence, and it is just a matter of using an appropriate case of this verb. In the end, both versions are the same.
Note: it's possible to use will as a simple inflection of an imperative: Will you give me your wallet? and Will give you wallet. (See more on will here) It can also take a subjunctive: How may I give it to you? In this particular case though, this is a very uncommon construction (and you don't need will there).
In the case with rates (which seems to indicate a plural object): rates + inf = to [plural noun]"

It doesn't seem like rate fits as it is too general for your question, but maybe that is why I did not find it on Google.  
If we take a step back and look at the full sentence ""What's going to happen with interest rates?"".  Is the question asking what the current rate is, or what their expectations are for the future?  If we assume the former, I think the sentence is asking for a very specific answer as the subject is ""Rate"", not ""things"" or ""the economy"".  However, given the other choices, it seems like a reasonable assumption of the intent is that it means ""what are their predictions of what will happen to interest rate?""  This is my best attempt at answering without knowing the specific intent or even the context.

A:
The phrase what goes in the head, in this case what rate, can also be used to answer this question. I'm going for what comes to my mind first, and what would be the ""most common"" thing a native might say about this, though I don't think it's very idiomatic. In case you want to make it more idioms, let's say ""How does the market think about the situation?"".
Also: this is a tricky question because it can have several, maybe more, senses. You're asking a general question about ""rate"", you might not want a specific currency rate. But I believe a more common phrase like ""how is market thinking about?"" would not be so good, because you're not asking about a market, you are asking an opinion about something about which you have no access."
28,how do your exchange rates work?,"['exchange rates', 'work rates']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","How would an English speaker interpret the above utterances? To answer this question, we will make a brief examination of the meaning of ‘exchange rate’, by looking through the eyes of a native Chinese speaker; then we‘ll try to identify the underlying meaning in some of these utterings by making some simple modifications that would transform them into more “Chinese”, more familiar patterns of speech.
We'll use Pinyin (pʰinəjǐn）to represent the sounds of English and Hanyu (hænyü)
to translate them to Chinese characters. It's important to note that P-in-A-j-I-n can never be pronounced in the same way by Chinese speakers, because their pronunciation of P is always affected by the A-sound preceding it, like P in English. So the sound you hear in ""pinyīn"" and ""hanyū"" can NEVER be the ""same sound"".
The sound of pinyýn is /pɪnɨ.ɒ/.
To find the Chinese equivalent sound for it one must change the P from p to b-p, and in this way it becomes /bɔp.bː/. Then adding the letter n to the end, the pronunciation is changed from /pbɹɑ̯p̺nˑ/ to /pnˡ/, and the corresponding Chinese character is: 洧 (pn̹ˌ).
Similarly, to find out how the English pronunciation sounds like, one only needs to do the simple operation /nj/ before the final letter A, in a manner of /npɜp/. The Chinese translation of this sound is 能 (nʌn/dʐ/). In fact, this is also the most commonly used pronunciation for the word ""can"", but this pronunciation does not represent p-inyinn properly, so we'll ignore it for this exercise. In Chinese, PN is pronounced as /Pɯɳų/ (not as pɵiŋ/), so the actual pronunciation becomes: /paɽp/

29,what is the exchange rate?,"['exchange rate', ' rate']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","rate exchange the rate of exchange? 

A:
The first is ambiguous: rate is plural, therefore, exchange is singular, while the second is not.
But the last is also ambiguous, and the correct meaning depends on the intended use: you don't need to exchange something, you can change your money for something (if there are currencies being swapped).
You can also use the infinitive, in the context of the question, without any change in meaning: to answer the questions rate or exchange, the only answer you'd get is: ""the exchange"". So, what the author asks is what does ""rate"" mean. You should only use ""exchange"" because ""to exchange"" is an exchange."

Update: It turns out that this is not a question of English but of syntax. Thank you so much for your replies. And I apologize for making that a syntax question.

Final update: Thank both for all your answer, you guys. It took almost no time for me to learn the fact. But the problem is that my native language is Chinese, not English. So I just want to point out the grammar in Chinese: my sentence means the same as I wrote in my original post, but in that case, my grammar and your grammar are different as in your original reply in Japanese, the verb ""exchanged"" in ""how much the rates have exchanged"" should always be the object.

The problem is that if they overlap, that intent can be triggered by either; and in fact, there is some overlap: you could answer both with the exchange rates at the moment. The problem for us is how to decide which answer you should give. I think it's a judgement call that you're expected to make, but maybe not, or maybe you can make an argument about it and the community votes. This problem would be solved if you had a rule like: only answer exchange-rate-figure with intent(exchange-rates-with-current) or intent (rate), so you know what to say for this case. However, what do you do if, for example, you want all the possible answers to come true at once, i.e. you need both the rate and exchange figure?

Hi,
Change rates is a noun and exchange rate is an adjective. The meaning of change has nothing to do with exchange, so it's not correct to use change as a verb with the meaning that exchange. You can change currency if you want to, as in: you can exchange one currency into another. That's all."

What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?",", exchange currency rate exchange? and foreign currency exchange.

In fact we could easily say 'exchange rate' is a common term, even a popular term. You would never ask 'what time is it?', but more commonly 'how are the exchange rates doing this week?'
So in essence, we can safely assume 'foreign exchange' as the common name. 
And if you want to make the question more formal, you might say ""the word 'fiexion' means..."""

The sentence: ""what is our exchange ratio between dollars and pound"" is a noun phrase, not an utterances as claimed.
""utterance"" and ""statement"" are two different things in this context: one is for communication, another is just some kind of data. So it is not correct to say ""a statement"".
As your question is about the meaning of ""utterances"" I will use your context. The word ""noun"" means the same as ""sentence"" in that context I believe."
38,when does the rate get determined,['determined rate'],"Given the utterance: {}.

However, the other two possible answers, rate and price are not specific enough. For example, in a shopping app, when we are determining the total cost of an item, what is really being determined is price. The price might not be the true goal, but the user might be trying to determine the price of the item.
I feel that ""Determined rate"" is a more specific answer as it could only be true if the app was being used to help rate things in my store.

A more complex utterances is:
I want to know which of the next three is true:  A B C D   E
What is best to do with this?

Option 1: I have a table with all the available choices. If the user wants to specify the option then they must select from a list of acceptable values in the dropdown.
Pros: very intuitive. Cons: you need to write the entire list and have to update it whenever a new option becomes available. Also you might need multiple select options for an option with multiple choices (e.g. A and either B,C or D).
Solution 2: The user is given free text to enter the value. The system does not limit the type of values the can enter. For example: A, B and c
 Pros: easy to use for the end user.  Cons : if the system limits the allowed values it will be hard for users to provide valid choices
 Option 3: Have a free form input that can be validated in code by checking if values that are valid for that column, or a subset of that value are present in a pre-determined set of options. (For instance A=yes B=no  C= no but D= yes)
 What about the other three possible values of E? Does anybody know of a good, robust (not just a solution that works) method of doing this and if there is any benefit over option 1 or 2?

Specifically in relation to Option 2, but in general for any of of these options (1-3) is their a best practice way of solving this issue. And if so, where in your brain do you think that practice is in? It's probably more of an algorithm thing that is implemented in some type or logic. But where?

41,my card was not in the mail again can you advise?,['advise mail'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","advise card?

As mentioned by @Bryce, I feel ""card"" is better than ""mail"". But that is more to do with the fact that I have the verb ""be"" there. 
My first thought was ""Advise mail""
If you had a verb there - ""advise"" - then ""again"" would mean - the first time.
So ""advice again""  or ""inform again"".   (I'm not even sure if there is a word for just informing).
But ""to advise"", ""the advise"" and ""have a piece of advice"" also work - and are all grammatical (just ""has a little piece"" doesn't make sense). So it makes sense to me. The ""piece"" could be something small (a piece, perhaps) or larger (you can't just ""take advice"", you're advised to)
It is also possible there may be a specific reason why the card is not being delivered, e.g. a letter may need to be signed before leaving the company, and the recipient may not be at home (which is why I would use advise). That would be ""The advise is - I'm on my way to - to advise - (that)""
However you could also say ""I've received a note from the post service about why my mail is taking longer than expected - my answer is: ""it will be on its way - as soon as I can make an appointment"" or something similar  - or if ""on its (the card's) way"" (as opposed to ""your way"") sounds a bit odd or clumsy, you can just use the more common (and more normal sounding ) ""as soon"".
""You will have mail on your way again?"" or (less likely) ""You mail has arrived""."

A:
I think that your question is more about how one would use the ""best fitting"" intent of this utterances (e.g. ""when will you be able to come here""), not how to parse the sentence.
The only correct way for this sentence is to use make, as you need to specify the target location to which you are talking about: ""I will come when you arrive"". The reason why you can not use update is because the object of your sentence in this phrase is ""location"", and you cannot have update for a location. (I'm not 100% sure of that, however; perhaps update has been overloaded to also mean ""get updated"", but that is not standard and would require a special declaration by the parser; I don't know if such a declaration has actually been made).
If you ask ""How can I use intent?"" then you do not need the phrase ""which one"", nor a noun or noun phrase: you just use a verb or verb phrase and the correct intent will be selected by your parser. There will not be a ""filling in"" of a missing word."

The second is most natural, and if this was the only context, it would be correct. If we consider the full sentence, the context is ""I need a car urgently"", so we can use urgent or need, as this is more appropriate.
However, I have heard that for the first case, when the sentence includes an infinitive, you cannot use need as you would have a missing verb. So, what is correct? If so, is there any context that makes urgent more natural?
Edit: 
I have now come across this article: https://writing-online.org/need-and-urgent-in-an-infinative-sentence-part-1/
where the author says:
""It’s important to remember that an urgent infinitival expresses urgency in a general sense, not in the specific context of the event described. For example, “I” need an ’emergency exit‘ now.""
So does this also mean we cannot say ""card"" in this context? I think this quote from the article above is confusing me!
Thank you in advance. :)
Clarification: I need to have my credit/card, or a way out, urgently.   I cannot think of any other context (or sentence!) where I would use ""need card"" or ""urgently"".

What does it mean exactly?"" is not relevant, but I can think on this. It is about the meaning of using need. As far as I know, we usually use an imperative, unless we are giving a statement, which we don't do in most cases? But I am not sure in either case what the difference between the three phrases in my example is. Perhaps it doesn't have any difference at all. And I suppose a verb is needed, right? The imperative needs a gerund or gerational form, like ""a"" for need or credit. Is that what you are saying?  Is not urgent meaning that you need something urgently because you do not want to be late? So urgent means it happens sooner? And not ""you"" because it does not specify the identity of"

It seems like a fairly straightforward query, right? But how about this: do you take the train or the highway? If you say the latter, is it the same question as in the first sentence? Why or why not? Is there a way to express these sentences that is grammatically correct without being vague or awkward? What about: What time are you going to be here? and Why are we going? The latter two are very similar. The first one seems to indicate something specific, and the second one is just an introduction for what follows.

@J.R. Yes, but the point is, why ask it this way? As I read it, a grammarian would be confused and think the two queries could not have the intent you think they do, as ""deliver is not a verb.""
I'm pretty sure most of these things have a similar connotation. For example, you can't say ""I took the delivery"", because you didn't ""take delivery"". Similarly, ""drop the letter to my uncle"" could be used in a sense that you meant to ""give the mail to him."" I don't know what it would mean ""pick up the package at the post office"" or ""bring it with you when you arrive"".
In my own mind they are all pretty similar, or at least they can all be. It depends what you mean by ""here"" and what else it could mean. ""Take the (train, highway, etc.)"" sounds the most ""correct"" to me - it's the usual way you describe doing something. But it depends a lot on context. Does the question relate to one event? To many events? Are they both about one set of circumstances? And then, it changes how the answer should be worded. If it is about several events, then you should describe several things and not just one, in which case take might be right (unless they relate somehow, like ""How many deliveries do we expect to make this week?"").
And even then the answers can vary depending on your intent. A simple one might say: You take one of the roads."

53,what is the difference between standard and express delivery?,"['standard delivery', ' delivery']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","delivery; delivery standard.

A:
[C]ontrary to other answer: The difference is that a delivery to an address can also be a ""courier"" or ""delivery by a company, like DHL."" 
Express mail has always been something quite different. From a legal point of view, it should be delivered directly to you. If you want to know the technical distinction: ""Express"" mail is when the mailer is a carrier - e.g. UPS, FedEx, DPD,...
So, technically express mail (i.e. to a physical address) would be something like [address: US address], whereas standard or normal mail would have something different - like, for example, [name: John Doe [ADR:[address]]] [mailing_type: USPS].
However, from a business perspective and legal perspective, there is no such thing as the ""best way"" to do delivery/mail. You are only bound by the laws in your country. (Of course, this doesn't work when you need to use ""international"" services, as they don't all have the same rules)"

(I'm assuming that the delivery is a necessary part of the question, but I'd appreciate your help.)
The question is on hold, because apparently it is ambiguous. But since it has also been put ""on-hold"" by another user, I cannot yet vote to ""Reject"" the ""OnHold"" request, and I wonder whether I should vote the request for ""Undeletion"".
I don't find it an ambiguous question (at least it wasn't intended to be ambiguous), since the intent can be clearly identified by reading the text. However, what if it really is an ambigous one (for all I know it could be), or what happens if a user decides to answer, when he doesn't agree with the initial closure? I mean, this kind of thing could lead to the closure of questions that really were good.
Is there any way to avoid this scenario, so users can choose whether to agree or disagree with an ""undelete"" vote?
In the meantime, the OP seems to have found a workaround (which I appreciate), by removing the part that has lead the moderator to think that it was ""ambiguous"". But it would be nice to not have to wait for that to happen. 
Note: as I'm writing this, there is no ""undo"" action that I can think of (except by the mod, as the post was previously deleted, which will also be removed), so if I could vote (I really can't, since I didn't ask the questions on this site in the first place), I would vote ""reopen"", since that's the only available option right now. I do understand that, in this case, that might be a ""non sense"" (because the asker can just add some more sentences), but it can happen that a question gets removed without having a clear reason (maybe because it didn;t receive enough votes, for instance), which is why I am asking the community for feedback.

I know there are many similar questions on the web (this one being one of them), but they don't help me to clearly understand the difference among these three, as well as the different combinations between them and the others.

A:
The first question is a fact: ""When will I receive [the new Card ]?""
You don’t need any condition to ask that question. A simple question like ""Is my order shipped already?!""
But you might want to add a condition in order to express a more fine-grained expectation: When shall I expect that it will arrive?
For the second question, you‘d probably have something like the sentence above. ""I‚'m waiting for the new [Card]"". Again, I wouldn”t think of it as ""asking for a date"", but as a statement about the ""situation"". But you could also use a question and use one or more of the above ""when"" verbs: Would it be better to expect the next day? When does the postman come? I could even make it ""the day after tomorrow""
Finally, when do you expect an up-to-date version? ""We will expect it tomorrow"", or ""As soon as it is released""."

The intent I am getting most excited about is'receive my new (customer-issued or other issuer-defined) card'. It is a bit like the location, but it's more focused on the card rather than the address as such and so you could, for example, be in a place where cards are not permitted and thus your location would be irrelevant. It also has a similar benefit to location-based services because you're able to control the time that the request takes, meaning you can choose to 'wait' without worrying about whether a delivery van will be along when it happens. The main downside would then be to avoid 'noise' where possible, as that could be misinterpreted as a rejection.

I am not sure that I understand correctly the question. If there is no need to show your current position then you may not need any location service. Otherwise I do think the Location is quite nice. You can set the delivery time and the app will tell you when you get the information. (If it is delivered before you are home)
In your case it sounds like ""Do not allow delivery"" will work fine. So it will not be delivered to you until the next day."
59,how long will it take for the card to arrive?,['arrive card'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","arrive a card
A: 1. I want to know when my card will arrive.  2. How long for a package to be delivered.
B: What time does the post office arrive in?  

If B’s sentence is grammatically and lexically correct, but not in the form required by A. then what does it mean? In my opinion, this sentence should not be in a particular tense as a whole. Because it should be able to express the meaning A's question can convey by expressing the same meaning in different ways. Is there a rule on this?
In case B: ""What time is it now?"", it is an expression of time-of-day. So B's sentence means 'how long has the time been?'  I thought that B is a grammatical sentence for 'What is now?' but the answer is that A is also gramatical for this meaning. This is why B can express both meanings, as I understand it. But if that's right, then why can't B express A directly in A form, such as ""How long is ____?""
I've tried to find it in various grammar texts but I can‘t find a definite answer. Maybe this question is too open-ended, since it“s more of a ‘what”? kind of discussion. (I don't want the question closed though, please let me know if it needs to.) Thanks for any comments. :)  : )
EDIT: I think the confusion comes from my understanding that ""arrive"" is not an event but a continuous, ongoing process of delivery. Therefore, the sentence: How much time has it taken for my order to come? is semantically correct but gramatically wrong. The correct sentence needs a finite form of have/be/take, and it seems it could just be: when did we receive our order? But I don‡t think it matters in terms of the grammar. In any case, I hope I'm not too confusing!

We've now reached the end of Part One and the first of many questions we're going to try to answer. We've looked at the sorts of things that can help us determine the 'what' of a question, as well as giving us clues as to how to approach the answer, in Part Two of this book. Part Three looks at how people use their language, and Part Four covers the various methods of communication. It's time to look in detail at what is probably the most fundamental of all questions: How can I get you to talk to me?
Chapter Three:
  |
RULE 3: THE FOUR PRINCIPLES OF INTERACTION
| 
---|---  

  THE KEY TO INTERACTING with people is to understand how they communicate. How do they think about communication? What do their gestures show them? And what do the things they do to you tell you about their way of life? How to find out? Start by trying to read their body language.  What they are doing is giving you clues to their feelings or intentions. If they're angry, for example, their arms might be crossed, hands shoved into their pockets; if they look at you directly, a confident look might well be conveyed. Try to interpret what they say, but also what their lips and eyes say to others. A look that asks 'Do you know this person?' could be just as informative as an audible question. Once you have an idea of what you are dealing with, then you can work out what kind of attitude to adopt.

 THE EIGHT INTER-ACTIVE FACTORS
There are eight interactive factors, which are:

 1. **Speech**
 2. the **voice**

 3. physical **gestures**, such as eye contact, the head, hand and body positions, touching, nodding and pointing
 4. facial **expressions** (especially smiles and frowns)
 5. non-verbal **physical actions** : gestures and movements
 6. verbal **body language** – the words people say in addition to what the other person is doing"
61,ordered awhile back what is the eta in the us?,['ordered eta'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?",", is ordered the present tense of the verb to buy. If so, why doesn’t ‘is‘ fit “is ordered.” If not, what are the alternatives?

This is a difficult question because it doesn't make sense to speak of a present ""tense of buy"".
I suspect that the sentence is trying to say that ""what is"" is buying something.
Thus ""The best fit is to interpret ’what“ as ""is"".  ""
""This"" ""buy"" and ""ordered"" are nouns here.  They have nothing to do with what, when, and how. They're just the noun phrases that are in this sentence. So ""the et"" refers to the thing being bought."
62,how long should i expect for the card to arrive?,['arrive card'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","arrive soon? (I'm not sure)

A:
The best model is probably: the intent you want to express is 
when I say when should I expect the  (some) card,  I want one of these: ""soon"", ""in an hour"", or ""never"".
This is not perfect but I think it is close to what you intended in your question."
63,whats the delivery time to the united states?,"['united states', 's time']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","s delivery of us? (the time) s duration united state? What does 'united states' refer to, and what does it have to do with the verb 'to be'? Is what follows after the word 'be'/'are' a preposition or a conjunction? Or does the question need to be reformulated to make it make sense (as in, What are the conditions under which I will be able to deliver them to you within 2 weeks? )
What are some of the rules for deciding when to use which prepositions with which words?

A:
As far as I can tell, your first example is not grammatical at all, the second is an example of 'ambiguous' or 'non-finite' construction.
In the first sentence, ""whats the"" is used as a relative pronoun, but as far we know, there is no antecedent. There is a subject (whom, or what?) and ""the delivery"" could be either an object or an accusative, in which we should replace ""them"" or ""time"" with ""delivery"".
If we follow this line of reasoning, it follows that ""what"" should be followed by a noun or noun phrase. It should not be preceded by ""of"" (though of is sometimes used this way, see ""I am of two people who dislike you"" = ""Of the two, I dislike one of them."")
The second example has a verb phrase that is ungrammatical. We should ""to them"" instead of ""for them"". A similar problem is found with  ""Whats duration?"" and it is also un grammatic."
64,when will the card arrive?,['arrive card'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","arrive cards?

A:
 
The first two examples can be seen as a single unit because the second can always follow the first, and the third is a variant of the other two.
In this case, all three have the same meaning: the verb will be used to express the action of arrival of a card, as opposed to the noun cards, meaning 'card', or the pronoun it (used when the subject of will is inanimate).
Note that the sentence in your example does not have a subject. Therefore, the word it is not required."
65,send my card as soon as you are able to,"['send card', 'send card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","I will send? Send me?

66,when are cards delivered?,['delivered cards'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","delivered tomorrow? sent on a date? when delivered, cards will be delivered today? etc.?

A:
.
There is no best possible answer (and, as you point out, any reasonable human being could interpret the phrase ""when delivered"" very differently from how you mean it). 
For your specific example, I think ""delivered today"" is by far the most likely interpretation. ""Tomorrow"" and ""sent on the day"" are also somewhat likely, but it's probably not a given that one can infer it from the context alone."
67,how long does shipping take to get to a us destination?,"['us destination', 'get destination']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","destination in us or destination on us? What are the other choices for a question that asks about shipment to the United States?

The answer is that it depends on a few factors:
1. How many words and phrases are there in a document? A document with lots of complex sentences will most likely result in an increased document length due to all the punctuation.
2. Is there a lot of content or is it more like a sales email with only a couple sentences per paragraph? If it's a long email or text (like a blog post) there will be more opportunities for errors to creep into the copy. This could be from spelling, grammar, punctuating, and even missing or adding words. (For example, ""it's more"" could become ""its more""; the word ""and"" is a great place to put commas).
3. Does the document have any images that will slow things down? There are lots and lots ways to use images. The use of images will depend on if that's the only way to show an idea or what that idea is. For example: an image may be used to tell the client that they are important, or it may just be a way of showing that something is in stock or not available. An image can make a copy or a letter seem more personal, so if this is being used for personal copy, an extra effort should be made to ensure that no errors creep in. 
4. Are there any spelling or grammar errors? For longer documents or documents with a large number of words, it is common for some of the language to slip through. Spelling and grammar mistakes are often overlooked and are a part of life. It should never be said, however, that these mistakes have no impact. Even though most people don't notice grammar and spelling errors, they can be distracting, confusing, hard to understand, etc. If this language needs to be in there, do your best to make sure it stays intact."
68,can i get my card expedited?,['expedited card'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","expedite card payment? card processing? Get a card issued? Card expediting?

The answer is 'no', because no single phrase answers all of the possible intents. In most cases, the answer will be the nearest fit. For example, 'expedit' is a possible fit for 'can i expediate?' but 'pays' would probably not fit, since 'payment' usually implies an immediate transaction, in contrast to a delayed issuance of a credit card.
In all cases except for the most general cases (e. g. 'to expedit'), the intent is usually the topic of an independent question. E.g. for expeditable, such questions would include 'Is it expeditious/expediatable? Is it to be expedient?', or 'How can I expeditate this process/transaction?'."
69,how long until my card is delivered?,['delivered card'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","delivered mail? mail delivery?

The first seems too specific, so the second seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if this is accurate.
Thanks. 
*Disclaimer - I use this phrase on my website, and I've had some comments that it isn't very common. So, my question is: Is it used in real life? If so, how? Or if not, is there a commonly used equivalent that does not have that connotation? It's a matter of concern, especially since my customers are not native speakers of English, many of whom are in Asia. :)
EDIT:
I thought of this, too: How long is a mail delivered to me? What do you mean? I have your e-mail, what else is being delivered (to my home)? I don't think this fits the use case, however, because it seems to be more of a reference of ""delivery"" and ""mail"" than a question about delivery time frame. But, I still feel like there's some context I am overlooking in this sentence. Could I be looking into something?   Thanks. =D
PS: If any of you find this question to not fit in the FAQ, please, let me know. I'll delete and repost it elsewhere. Also, thank you for any answers. You've all been very generous. :D  :)  -Thanks, everyone!  =)  PS: This answer is based on one of the comments by a new commenter. Thank you, dmjohnson, for helping me see how this word usage is so common in my native language. It is definitely used to describe time. And now, that's how I was using the word. Thanks!
FINAL EDIT: In a recent eLearning post, it was claimed the expression should be delivered in 1-2 weeks. Now, the context is very clear and this does help clarify things a bit, since I do not need to use the phrase. However, there are still things I need clarity on. The context seems, to say the least, a little strange. My assumption was that the person asked the question of how fast mail arrives to the address they're at. They're wondering about the expected delivery date. Yet, they ask about when the card will be shipped. How could the latter phrase help in that question"

A:
“As a rule, when we are trying to express time, we have to use ""when"" or ""by"":
as possible = by when
As for other examples. ""card"" means a type of card, ""as soon"" is an expression about time and is usually used with ""to"" (as much time as required, as quickly as the situation allows) and ""come"" expresses a movement and has no special time related meaning. 
""Come as"" doesn't make much sense to me.
Edit: As per OP's request, I would say ""I need you to make the card come to my place by Wednesday"""

In the context of this utterances, I'd say they are synonymous. I see no reason to have two distinct intents. ""i am a waiter"" is synonymous with ""I am working"". I don't see why one would be ""better"" than the other. In other words, ""arrive"" could be synonym to ""get"".

I think there are a few ways to think about this. If I'm waiting, that I am not doing anything (e.g. not going to the office, just sitting idle) but expecting a certain outcome (a result) to happen, then my intention would definitely be the outcome. So 'arrives' is appropriate, not 'get'. 'Get' would not be appropriate to indicate 'i want someone else to do something'. In the example above, it could mean, 'I want my friends to get my credit card ready for me'. It doesn't imply that they're working for someone, or that i'm working. 'Arriver' implies that the person has something to give me, when all i want is for the credit to come (and it will).
If the result is a card, as opposed to a result, i would say my intension would likely be that there's a credit there so i can take that credit, and so I could either use get or arrive as I would use ""give"". If i knew that ""giving"" implied an act on someone's part and ""getting"" didn't, perhaps there'd be more of a difference between get and arrive to distinguish between the two. And if the meaning of the word was the same, there would only be a choice between ""there's (an) arrival (here)"" and just using arrive, because both are appropriate. But since they may not always be synonymous (i.e., get could also be used to imply 'there is nothing to this' or 'don't worry about it'), and since we're talking about a specific outcome and not a generic concept ('give' in the sense of 'to give'), it makes sense that arrive implies the desired result. You could use arrive in order to 'give', but it wouldn't"

The other three are not as common. You are correct to use your judgment on the one that best fits the situation. A good rule of thumb is to always try to match the context to the word. If you are in a conversation about a particular situation and a customer tells you about needing their card, the natural response would be to ask, ""Need your what card?""
For example:
1- If they have an issue and don't know the answer. ""I need your credit card.""
2- In a question. (""Need that? - yes, it's on my desk) If it is an action that needs to be done and the person asks ""when?"" ""Immediately?"" etc. the most natural way to answer is ""yes,"" ""now"" (as opposed to ""later"") or ""right now (and it will be here in just a few secs)."". The ""do you need it now"" question is not very common, because of the question's meaning. It is much more of a statement, so the ""No, I need a little time"" answer would also work fine. This is common in the business world. Someone could ask ""Do you want that report right away?"" and you might respond with ""Yes, need the report as early as I can get it."" (or any other similar response).
3- To answer an inquiry. Say you have a person inquiring about something. As a response you could say ""your account is due for a refund.

We’re going to take a crack at a little bit of NLP – natural language processing.
In particular, the problem of intent classification. We‘d like to use this as an exercise in building some useful, domain-specific models. The ultimate goal is to be able to identify which of these intent classes best describes a given utterant. Here are some examples of utterances we plan to work with as ‘training” data:
1) “When will you be getting my order?“
2) ""My card arrived today.""
3) I want to send her a gift card.‬
4) She says she‮needs a‭ gift‪‫card. ‬‹›‥″′
5) The„order‰is being‏sent‧now ․‖‡‱‚‛
6) We ordered the order. It※arrived yesterday,‣ but―it‟ isn    arriving—‴
7) A gift certificate arrived in the mail today. I‵want‶to‌send• her ‑one‗‿‍ for‷a cupcake‼ shop. She‸said‾the‽‐’�it will be sent today
8) When will I get your order/order? _______.___.____.______.__._____?_
I think all the examples have the same basic structure. A simple verb in a question, followed by a noun, usually with a prepositional phrase. So far, we can guess that the first uttering has intent ”arrive‬�card‭�‎‒…
the last two have intent: „send gift"" and ′–order be delivered†‥�‚郡. These three are all noun+noun utterments, with noun phrases in them. In all four examples the nouns that​come �first �at‫�all"

In this case the most appropriate slot would be ""choose"". But for another example: Can I have the last piece of pizza?, then ""i should have"" is more reasonable. If you wanted to get a ""best fit"", a possible choice could be: [choice] [choosing][time]

Can i also ask you how to detect a user intent to order from the website? Or does my understanding here not make sense?
Do I ask this as a question, or is it a statement (‘I want to have specific days to receive my stuff” or ” ’i want my items delivered in a spec“)?
If this question is not appropriate to ask here, please feel free to direct me to another Q&A website that may cover this topic.

Edit: My understanding is that it should be „day- specific"", not ″day specific.‴
The example above should also clarify my point:

Example from Amazon: If your Amazon device does not have an app, you are prompted with a message such as: ""Your app isn't installed. Please check that your app is available for Android devices and then download it from your store to try again"".
I don‚t understand why I cannot use ‚day -specific´ here. I know this sounds dumb, but I don't get the answer in my head. (I also tried to google it, and came by ‛delivery day - specific´ and ‪deliver day´. Both are quite the same.

P.S. This might look like an essay question, but it is quite a question and is asked in the real world, hence the title. 
The real situation comes from an application where it has to be a ""delivery on date X"", and one person has ""specified a delivery on certain day"" (and is willing to give more info later), and i want to make sure i don't use it, or should i?   (I know about using ""after"" etc, however those are not exactly equivalent to what i'm asking for, since the delivery might happen after a specified day, as the OP mentioned) and  also, there are other ways to say ""give it to me on the date specified"", so is there any difference in meaning? and should we be concerned if we have two ways of saying the same thing? Thanks. I hope the above is clear enough. It would also be good to add the part that has nothing to do with the actual question (so please don' leave it as an unformatted text)

Does the existing set cover the most commonly used intants? What are its limitations and problems? How should they (or this) be used? Etcetera. This is an open question, and I'd love any help anyone can provide. Thanks for reading!
EDIT (to include some clarifications): I don't have an actual data set to look at. But I expect to start accumulating data soon. My first data-set is from a simple experiment with a student-instructor pair. The instructor says ""i cant get the card on the table"" (this is how i want to capture it). The student says: ""I can, i think i did something on my computer"" (""i think"" is used because of the student's uncertainty).
Second experiment (a group-task, with 6 people) is somewhat different (the student may have tried multiple cards, etc.)
Third, I will be collecting a few dozen more of these (and a couple more variations), and plan to have a look how the system interprets them. A lot of this is still open: what are the limitations, how does the user's behaviour affect it, will these additional intant cause any problems, can I make some better predictions from the corpus data, would the data be sufficient to develop a better language?

If you want a bit more info on this, please ask, otherwise I'll post some data when I have it. 
As an aside, this question has been asked before, by the OP of another question. There is no need to ask it twice.

I have tried to search on google and on the internet but I haven't found examples.
If the sentence would be: ""My card breaks."", would the above word be suitable? Or would another one be more appropriate? And would this be considered as a correct use of this particular word? I've always thought that in such cases only the first two words of a relative clause (i.e with 'which, who', ect) are necessary.  In this case, would I even say ""brokes card""? or do I really need to say the whole thing, ""Card which broke""?

This is not a duplicate of What do you say when you break something? (it's about the object). It's more of an ""what's the word?"" kind of question than asking for the definition.

I believe this may come down to a question of how you expect an action to be performed based on an intended use.

For example:  -  I was using my card to pay the bill... it stopped working. - I need a new battery for my working watch. Is it OK to say the card has stopped or broken, or does it need batteries?

John LawlerJan 18 '15 at 8:32

@JohnLawler I think the most correct answer depends on the context.
If you ask a card player what their card has and the person says 'broken' or 'not' then the correct sentence is probably 'I think your card isn't broken' but if you said something like 'What is your good luck charm?' and someone replied'my broken card of spades' I'd probably think that's a good answer. If I was to ask something about my lucky hand of cards then that question is definitely answered by saying 'My lucky card'
As for the 'why not' question it's hard to give a one word answer as there are many ways to say something so you could be referring to:
Why I don't have a broken car
- Because I have not broken it
My car isn’t broken
Because it is not
The car is working

A:
– What is a card?
Card is a word which has two different senses.
First is ""a playing card, as a deck of 52 cards.""
Second is used in the context ""Why is my credit card not working?"" which means ""My credit/debit card is not functioning in such a way as to enable me to make transactions."""
96,my card isn't working anymore,['working card'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","my-card-is-no-longer-working card (with no further intent)?

We have the situation when my_card has ceased working and we know that this situation is a new one with respect to a particular entity and that it is caused by a change in the system which has not been detected as of yet.
It is not possible for us to know the precise state of the card at a certain time in order to determine the intent. In that case, it might be better to use mycard. This also applies to the sentence
I do not know why my bank's cards were changed. 
As the bank is known to be a trusted entity in which changes to card handling are not allowed, I'm sure that the intention of this phrase is to express ignorance, not to refer to what has changed in some unknown way."

For example:
Know: I need a new card.
Be informed: My card has been declined again and I have to contact my bank. (Note: inform is better than tell as it's the opposite of tell)
Inform future user: It looks like your card will be declined soon, I should have it ready.  
The best answer I could find was this: Is it correct to say that ""know (what's-wrong)-(future-time)""?
This says I can have ""be informed"" and ""inform"" as the correct way to use these words. But the examples given don't make sense to me. For instance: ""I should be told my password is incorrect."" - I don’t get what the ""should"" has to do with the verb, ""tell"" or ""being informed"". It doesn't seem that a correct response would be: “It looks as if your password has not been changed. Would you like to change it?” - what is being changed here. It‘s the time that is changing. This is not correct. You need ""to be be in a certain condition"" to ""change"" that something. I am a student with a background in psychology so this is confusing, but I think what I want to ask is „Is it OK to inform somebody that ‚your card number was stolen today‛ in the future time when the card is to be used again? I understand that one of the things the OP is asking is which of ‘to know‟, ’ to tell“, and ”be to informed„ are the most suitable.‭‬‍ However I‚m a bit confused why ‛to inform‡ means› to ‗tell″ and not to give the information in order to‖ be ‡ informed.

I need to know it because I want to add another verb to it (say to work with). I've noticed that the work verb is used for things like I am working on a work proposal, I'm going to make a proposal for a working with my coworker etc.

A:
The key is whether you're using a single verb (or a sequence with a verb at the front) or whether there is a different verb before or after the main verb. For your case, ""work card"" and ""wortkard"" (with the verb ""to work"" at either end) are both plausible, but the first sounds very colloquial, whereas the version with ""for work (and/or"") sounds more formal. ""Work card"", in particular, doesn’t sound right. It's not really a card for doing work; it's a way of making an electronic card. 
""My work doesn/works"" on the other hand is fine. That would be an example of a simple sentence (one verb). If you wanted to use more than one (a sequence), you'd just use a more complex construct, such as ""I am making a/a work/work proposal"" or ""my cowork is/is going/going to propose a new feature."""

A:

Meaning
I think that the use of a preposition like of, at, and on is often an indication of the speaker's uncertainty about what is being described.
If the card IS broken, then there's very little chance of confusion, since there is no alternative meaning of ""my card,"" the question is redundant. In this case, the first option ""The Card is Broken"" would be preferred. But the second option is fine. However, ""A card"" does not mean ""My card"", so in this situation, I can't see why anyone would use ""the card"".
It's possible that this phrase was used in a context where ""card"" might be construed as a card game, in which case it might imply ""I have a broken or bad card."""

Is a more specific intent needed to specify the meaning of stop working or can it be derived (as in the sentence still working)?
If so, what would the more precise intent be?
Or is it sufficient to say the card no(s) longer works, and the intent is just to convey a state change? In this case, does the answer change if no more card works?  That is, is (2) a possible answer, or does it only apply if there happens to be another card left in a pile of cards? 
I am interested in answers from both intuition and logical-grammar based reasoning to my questions.
My instinct is that there may be a difference in meaning for the two, based on what happens next (the card stops working is a bit different then no card anymore in my mind), but that seems like bad reasoning.  If there is really no difference, can someone please point me in that direction?

""The computer is in an error state"" - this does not imply that the computer still runs at all
What is ""stop working for a reason""? - This implies that it is still in fact working, not that a problem has been detected, nor has a failure been logged, but rather that ""it is stopping"".
When is my car going to work? - I don’t know, it might have broken down in which case it will be stopped.
 
Update: The difference between (1) and (4) may not be immediately obvious, I think. In (3), my sense is there has to have been a prior intent to stop the working of a thing - perhaps by replacing it with some other thing that works. (A similar thing may have happened in (5), the thing stopped running.) In the case of ""The water has stopped flowing down the river"", there would be an intent in place at the time that things stopped, to make it so that all the water in question flows down a river,"
104,my card is broke what do i do?,['do card'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","do broke? or both.
Is it grammatically correct?

This is another example of the same thing. Do you have a card that has a hole in it? I think this means the speaker does. It would be grammatical for the listener to say: My card has (a) hole(s). But I don't know how common it is for listeners to ask about holes in their cards. 
So what is correct: I have card(hole) or My Card has(no hole)
What if the card was broke. Is it correct to then say? My Broke card or my Broked card. I've always seen that as a double negative. The first half, card, and then the negative of broke, not broke card...
Also what does a speaker of this grammer mean if they ask: What do you do when your card broke?, which is essentially the question, what action/response, do, when the subject is a person and not a noun?  Is my answer for what a listener should do wrong? Or should the first action be what to do with his/her card and what should be the result of doing it. Or are these questions only appropriate for a realtor? Is the grammar in general different in a question like this versus say, a simple one. For example, how would you respond to a: how is your weekend going? and to that the response: it's going really well so far. Would you say it went well or did well? If it were the latter then I wouldn't say that it did go well, would I, I would say did? What I thought I heard in one of these, well was it good, or good? It may have been that I misheard that. This is just one situation to clarify what I mean. Thanks. :)
EDIT
After reading several responses. Thank you. So I am not asking what my intent is when using grammars, so for those who thought so. You are welcome to your assumptions if you can prove me wrong. Also this was more a general question. But if someone were to answer one example it will help clarify to other people that might have the similar problem. If that makes sense, again it wasn't meant in anyway as an insult to any one person. :))
Thank you for clarifying"

example sentence   use_intent_of_the_best_examples
I will use my [card] to pay [a_person] for some item[s].

The intent should not be understood as:
""I cannot use a debit/credit card.""

'I can use neither a credit/debit card'
and 'I need to buy something with a card, so I need one.'
etc
Also: The intent could not have been to ask what is a ""credit/bank card"", but only what are the possible usages of a such device? (And if that is not the case, what should be changed?)
Is ""I have a bank account"" and ""i have some cash "" the right way to say ""my card is empty"" in French?
Thanks in advance.
PS: A Google search gave a bunch of irrelevant (IMHO) answers, and I did not understand the context of the example sentences provided, as they seemed to refer to something else. Also, I found no ""canonical"" usage of ""informations"", so, maybe, the question is unanswerable. 
EDIT: Some examples provided: I use this one, but it is actually an answer (I'm not sure if the answerer understood it's intent and if it even was an intent), it could be considered not to answer the OP, though: https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&q=i+use+my+card
It is an example that I understand: ""What is that in the back?"" and not ""Is this card valid?""   (It would sound like I said ""Can you see what's in that thingy?"")

109,i cannot use my card,"['use card', 'use card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","Use the card in? Get a new card from this device?

I've read a little about ""intent"", but still not quite get it.
From what I know, the intent is a concept of a ""task"" the computer is trying to execute. E.g. if you ask a computer to ""play movie"" and it gets a song, it knows that it does not belong to its normal tasks. This seems to make sense - I'm a bit lost when looking at it from the point of view of someone in a phone conversation. The phone guy asks for the address of the place, and gets it, without asking any intent or ""what to do with it""; and if he would have got back a question like ""Are you sure you want to use your address as a location?"", the answer would still be ""Yes"".
Now - the situation is: I have an Android phone with no data/internet connection (except for one app that has wifi - and not always), I can send text messages, etc.; and I want my phone to be able to send the SMS ""i cannot send money using my app because data is out"", to some external recipient, i.e. a third-party. 
The question is - which of these 4 sentences is best fitted for a SMS sent by the phone:
Sentence one: Use Card
What this says - is that I'd be doing this (use card) for some reason, e. g. I might need my bank card for an online transaction. But what if, instead of using the bank, I use some other app on the same device, with access to the online wallet? What happens then? Do I still need to give a reason? Is that the correct interpretation? If it is, then my second sentence is better: (Use the Card in).
Or: Do you need the reason for using it? Or would any reason - even some random reason (e g ""The card was a present"") be acceptable from what's going on with the app? I would think so, but it seems I don't really ""understand"" what the intention of ""Why"" is. Is it some concept which doesn't exist in natural speech? Does ""why"" exist only when talking about the meaning?  And - would a better question then be: ""How do I give someone"
110,the card i've got seems to be broken,['seems card'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","seems broken? Seems broken card!

The context is a customer service interaction in which the user reports a problem with a printed image on an electronic device: The screen has been broken... the screen is broken and it looks like... The image looks... it has a red border...
If there is more than one fitting option, which one is considered the most common in such situations and why?
Context:
We have some cards printed via a third party provider (who we have had problems with in the past), and one of them has broken in half. The user has reported this to us, and we are trying to figure out what is actually wrong.
Our customer representative (the one who is talking to the customer) has the above mentioned utterances on her mind, while thinking how they can best be used to help the client (i.e. customer).
Edit: To be clear, we expect only an utterence (a word) that can be applied to an object, not to something else. We are not trying at all to make sure that the words are only being applied with regards to a particular context (like the image in question). Rather, our intention is to give an advice on which word could be better. That is all. 
My gut feeling is that seems (as it is an adjective) would be the right one. Seems is not as strong as broken (and not much stronger than ""card""), as it doesn't say that a certain part of its meaning (in this case the broken bit) is in doubt. Broken says that something isn't what it's supposed to, like when you break a promise or something like that. It seems could work, but I'm not certain either...   This one seems the strongest one, since the sentence starts with the verb ""has broken"" and follows with ""the screen"".
Another possibility: looks
This one just feels weaker. I don't know why, though. Maybe because of the ""it looks"" part. Looks can also mean ""seems like"" (see here):
Example for the meaning:  the dog has two legs. — The dog seems healthy. (meaning: It has no broken legs)
But then this sentence could also be about the appearance of a (particular) dog, in this example with legs like two sticks (which doesn"

Is that working, card working? If not, is there another term for that? Working-card? Can't find the right search terms.
I am wondering which would be most suited to the meaning ""My (card's) suddenly stopped working,"" or alternatively, ""I just realized that my (not yet working) working-cards are not being used"".
Context: The cards are ""working"" because I am able to get them to perform the intended function (in my case, a function where they are playing an audio file). But I don't know the actual name of that function, so I can't say to myself, I have to work working cards to make that work. In fact, right now I'm looking for a way to say ""Hey look, these working workingcards aren't being turned on"", and I figured they were just called cards. But then I remembered working was a term used to describe them, and since I wanted this to be my first question here, it seemed like working should be a good word for them. Unfortunately the other words like ""card"" didn't come up in my search. Any suggestions would help. Thanks for reading.  
If it matters: I live in the southern US, although I know that card means something different here. And I've been doing work on the cards for several weeks. I was thinking of using an adjective, such as ""functional"" or ""useful"" to qualify those terms, but then realized I would have more luck if I came right out with a card name. The card is still in a prototype phase, in other terms it's kind of like a ""wet card"". I want to try to keep my language as general as possible so it will translate easily to many countries. However I will probably be speaking English on a daily basis. There might be some regional differences here too, as I read that in some places that term ""to work"" has a specific meaning: it means ""make"" rather than ""perform"" as the term is used here (I don;t know how much that is true), so that might affect the translation. As I said, working might not be the exact right word either. Again, any suggestions are appreciated. This is mostly an English class exercise, though, for some reason, the instructor doesn't have"

In the interest of full disclosure, it's worth pointing out that this question may be somewhat of an invitation to be flamed for asking a question too broad to answer. But for the record it is not too broadly formulated. The question could be answered definitively with: ""Yes, the most likely intent of your example utterances is that they mean the same thing.""
The question really is about the distinction between the word card in the sense ""I have a card"" and the noun card as in ""This is a very good card."" A good way to test this is by substituting noun forms for example cards in some of the examples and asking yourself ""what word in English could replace the one in brackets."""

♦ Jan 21 @2:52 - I think that the second one sounds good. However, what I find a little odd is that there is no direct verb for 'nothing', so what could be the direct object of 'goes' in this construction? Could 'account' or 'card' be intended here? I would think the former. (And the latter is a very odd case.)
But I'm sure that my interpretation is not the only one and would appreciate an example (if any) of something like what is intended by the third and fourth examples. Thanks!
EDIT: In fact, the fourth is what really gets me. If the sentence is rephrased as 'Nothing goes on the card', then this would imply that something does go on 'the' card which is clearly not what was intended. In the case of the example I gave: 'I would have paid the bill' vs. 'The bill goes unpaid'.
So if the intent is to imply something went on a card (elegant way to say 'went through' I've noticed here - in the US it often implies the customer 'paid' the wrong amount and was charged), then the construction is actually:
'Nothing [go]es on [card].'
Or even better, in my opinion: (no?)
'the card does not go unpaid.' or
'money does [not] go into [the] card.' if we assume it's not a 'negative' sentence. But the last one,'money does enter the account', seems to be what's intended if it is assumed. Maybe something about 'a card' that's different from 'an account' is being referred to. So that might be better still: the'something' on/or in 'this card'/'this account'/'somewhere' seems like it could refer to a bank/payment card instead of to the whole world or to nothing at all. And it might even be a positive thing. It might mean that 'that bill does (go) into this' (account/card/bank).

123,i cant find my card it's gone,"['find card', 'gone card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","lost card found card

For the purposes of this question, we can ignore the card being lost or misplaced (we know how to locate it), and assume that the context is as a result of an attempted use of the ""card"" noun.
What are your answers? If the above were intended, I am aware I could use the adverb, and it would work as is. However, when I searched a dictionary, for find, it seemed that one of my options was find. Therefore, should I choose find or gone when the sentence's purpose is to describe the location of card X?
My understanding is that gone is more correct due to the fact that it is a verb, while find is not. This also makes sense because the noun ""gone"" is defined in English in various ways and could have various nuances of meaning, whereas the verb ""find"" (and its antonym, ""lose"") are simpler in terms of their meaning as verbs. Am I right in these conclusions? Or am I incorrect about how the word find behaves? Any insight will be appreciated. Thanks!
I'm not sure what to add regarding any of your feedback, so I will simply respond by saying thanks to everyone for all your input! 
EDIT: I would like to thank the members of TSE for their thoughtful, detailed, well-written responses, which have helped me greatly. I really enjoyed working through this challenge because, as I mentioned, this was a tough one for me. The most helpful suggestions were: to use a word that is an adjective (as opposed to a noun) when describing the state of a card, find instead of gone, etc. My reasoning for going the route of find was to avoid a potential ambiguity, where a different person would interpret the two words differently in the same sentence. Thank you all so very much for being so helpful! Now I know that I should be able to get past this next step, in which case I look forward to doing the next challenge. Cheers!

125,i lost my card,"['lost card', 'lost card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","lost key?

This question came up while I was preparing some sample data for the next step of an assignment, that involves some basic natural language processing and intent detection.
I am trying to write my data set so it will provide data to a machine learning algorithm that will help determine my intent from the words. I need a set of data that is easily understandable to humans but still allows for machine interpretation to be applied to determine intent. 
So far, the most accurate intent that I came across was to lose key. Does anyone have any ideas of what else would fit?   I am not a native English speaker and so my terminology may be a bit off, but that's ok - this is meant to provide a simple answer. Is it even possible to say the intent of the example sentence without actually having the card, without having to get into the context? Is there a way to tell if the user said they lost the ""key"" or ""card"".  This is for a university assignment so I can't use any tools that are not publicly available. Thank you for your time. Any input is helpful!
Edit:
Just wanted to add that i am a student in a class that we are required to do in Java - our professor has already given us code that uses a Stanford CoreNLP parser in the first assignment. This assignment involves parsing our own sample text into our very own parser. If I were to implement a parser without using Stanford, I would have to make the parser using the same set that Stanford uses, so the question still stands: Is my question possible? or does the answer only apply to Stanford?

The ""do situation?"" one might not be appropriate because it is too specific. A more general response would be ""What do?"" or ""How can?"" But it would need to be worded carefully to convey that it isn't urgent, but more than likely there'll be action. For example: ""I'm not sure. It might be a security issue. How can I find out for sure? Will you help?""
If you have an immediate action that is not urgent (ie. find your card), I'd go with ""find card"".

The answer is that it is a bit more complicated than that. You should always start with the main verb, since this verb is what will determine the subject and the object, which are the most important aspects of an utteration, when it comes to its meaning. The order of the verbs in an intransitive sentence is as follows:
• The word that begins the sentence, is called the “main verb.”
It has two functions: it must be a verb that does not have any prepositional, object or adverbial clauses. So the word ‘say’ is not a main or primary verb in the first sentence below: ” I said you were a great actor.
Note that this sentence has an object but not an adverberal clause. ’s is an auxiliary verb and ‹s› is adverbs. And the verb „love“ is neither a primary nor a auxiliary. It is therefore neither an ‚s ‛ nor an
‹a‛. This is important because it means that you cannot use verbs like ′says‚ †or ‼love says‼ (in other words, it will not make any sense). If the adverbal clause or ‒s had been a secondary verb then you could use a non-primary verb here like say or love say:„ He says you are a good actor..‘. However, the only main verbs here are to say and to love. (To know more about nonprimary verbs you would have to study a different book on grammar.)
If the order was: I stole your card then the intratransitive verb would be ›stole※. That is, there is no direct object (something you stole). There are two ways to interpret ″did you (verb) someone.″: either you took the card away from him or you told someone that they had stolen your car. In the second interpretation the direct-object of ‴you (verbs)‴ is ‪someone‬ (not ‱you‱). The verb you use here is know or know about. There is some debate whether this is trans"

It's also interesting that a lot of verbs have two possible forms to do with them. The have form is always used to express existence in the singular and the be form used for existence of an object in singular. In the case of ""help"" it would be ""have to help"", meaning ""I have to use this card to buy my groceries"" not ""there's no food in my house."""

I think that the last example might be best, although I am no expert.
So my question is, is there a commonly used term that means something like this, or what would be the proper synonym?
EDIT:
To clarify - the reason that I don’t know the term I should be using is that this question and some other questions I found when searching seemed to be about things related to a person and their personal card. As such, I think the answer(s) to the questions might differ depending on a specific context of the card as well. 
As a note, “stolen” in most contexts means a physical theft and the context that a business provides to its customers would likely not contain the intent to steal. This was my thinking behind my first attempt at an answer, but then I realized that even in business situations the customer might think something has been stolen or lost. So, to make it a bit more clear, my current question still pertains to that. If the question does require some clarification, please let me know. Thanks!
Edit2:   In further reading around, it seems like the correct term for what I was looking for was ‘steal‘. In my case, though, since my cards are business cards, the thief might have been a client, so it‚'s important to consider that, not just in my specific question but in many situations where a card or other business document is lost and not recovered, a thief would not necessarily be an outside party. For example, while a coworker might lose a piece of paper with important information, an employee might take it to hide from management. Regardless of how one might interpret the specific term or its various nuances, this is one of those situations that would require a term to include a broader interpretation than ‫my card was lost‬ (as in that question, where the person lost their card), and would most definitely warrant a synonomous term. I hope I have clarified that now! :)
Thanks again. Cheers! :D

DieterFeb 10 '14 at 10:24
it seems stolen cards are dealt with the intention to be returned and in the meantime to keep the card safe, the most appropriate term would be 'handle' rather than 'dealing', if there is a 'best fitting term'
if not, you can use either 'it' or 'the theft', but 'this' might be considered as a good fit

I'd say find the card in the context you described. There's no reason you would search for the word ""lost"" in this context. The person may simply be telling you that the person is carrying the cards and they want you to locate them. It's more likely for this to be a ""find card"" situation, unless the lost or missing card was on the actual person and not on their clothing.
In fact, there's some context where ""help"" could be appropriate. If the individual was lost in an area where there is a danger to them (i.e., a dark, enclosed place) and you are attempting to lead someone to safety, the appropriate intent would be ""lead to"" - this means I'm going to find your card and direct you where it's located.

No, it would be a question about what one should do to lose one's card. It could be asked as:
What should I do in case I had lost/lost my ID?
or
Should I get replacement ID card
If the person lost their ID and had it stolen, they would most likely be concerned about the safety of the other person (or people) they may have to deal with - what to do when their card is lost, and what are the implications in their situation? You might even say: ""I'm worried about my mother's safety"" - or: ""...what if something happened to my daughter?""

My own understanding is based off these scenarios, of being unable to prove a negative, which is why I am unsure of the correctness of my own thoughts. Please let me know if I've got it wrong. Thanks in advance!
P.S. I don't think you can use the phrase ""theft"". I think that's only possible of an object, but my understanding of ""steal"", ""lose"" and ""lost"" are that they can be used for both people and objects.

EDIT 2:  I did some research on the usage and meaning of these terms. While ""card"" is an American word, the rest I had to look up in Americana and the only difference I noticed was, ""to lose"" was listed as ""losethe"" or ""loose"".  For both cases of stolen and lost, my answer would still be the same. For lost card or lost person, however, a lot of sources said that ""person"" can mean either person or object. As such, an answer for the first case (object) is ""object"", for ""loss"" to be ""no"","

This is called a Relative Clause and a relative clause contains an additional preposed noun and this noun can be a subject or a direct object of the verb.

Usage of taken, stolen, taken and stolen is not always clear and unambiguous, so the correct preposition depends upon the context. However take has the strongest connotation of physical theft or taking (as a theft) whereas steal is used for a criminal offense (especially a crime of fraud).
The following three situations illustrate that the word taken is most often used when referring to a physical loss of a thing (e.g. a purse, a laptop,...) and the prepositions are used in the same order:

– Ben WJul 23 '14 at 21:47

@BenW I believe the correct answer would be lost, with stolen being a close second. In the case of lost and stolen, they are both ""intentions"", but lost is a much broader concept that covers not only physical cards but e.g. bank accounts, passwords, etc. Stolen could be interpreted as ""I lost my wallet"", whereas losing may indicate a more general ""the contents of my pocket have been compromised"". In general, ""lost card"" might cover both cases, but is much more generic than ""my card was lost"".
""My card has been lost"" would mean that the physical card itself (not its contents) has gone missing. So if there wasn't an intention to steal anything, it would sound strange, as that could have happened to any of the cards in one's possession, and they would all be ""missing"". Note that one might have a lost passport instead, in which case ""My passport is missing"" or perhaps ""They have taken my passport"" is appropriate (though it does seem somewhat unusual to say ""The contents have gone, rather than the passport itself"").
There might also be a context where the user might be speaking of a non physical or abstract item, such as a book, which is ""not available"". But the ""intention"" aspect isn't clear in that case. This may be different from ""This item isn’t available"" where one knows exactly what it was, whether it's a wallet or a phone-book. Perhaps the speaker knows the exact number of cards he has or wants, or the card type, so the intent of ""card missing/lost"" can actually be narrowed quite effectively. For the sake of this question ""wallet missing"", however, the broader ""loses"" and the narrower ""stolen"" may apply. I think I'd say that's just common sense in English-language usage. The ""senses"", ""meanings"" etc., of individual words are not the topics of these kinds of questions :-) In any case, my own sense is that ""Stolen Card"" isn's really a ""correct"", or even ""well-fitting"", answer, even if it is among common ones, although it probably would work for native speakers.

–
What you're looking for is something like this: ""stole card"" is an event whose outcome is ""someone stole something"", so the intent of the person uttering that sentence is to cause a specific event, and its outcome. In this case, that specific outcome would be that the wallet (card + money) is taken away and lost. 
In the case of ""my wallet is in her hands"", the sentence expresses a proposition – i.e. the proposition that ""something is a particular place or situation, where it was not a moment ago"".

150,how do i report my card lost or stolen?,['stolen card'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","lost card.

I feel like lost cards should be in its own section. I don't see why they belong in this one, but I can see the reasoning why it's grouped in with stolen cards. Just because someone reported their card as lost doesn't mean that your business should automatically put that card in lost mode. If the card was lost, then you might want to make changes or report to the issuer to try and get the stolen number replaced. But you also might not. That's part of the risk in accepting a lost/stolen card into your system and allowing someone else to use it. Maybe this should belong to some third ""lost/found"" section so that you don’t just lump the two concepts together. (Also, I would argue that a card report that states ""I lost my credit card"" is really two separate reports: ""Lost my..."" and ""Stolen my"".) Either way, though, it‘s a topic for a whole other thread that“s already been started."

In other words: given a scenario, what can I say that expresses the most appropriate intent for the situation? How do I select from an array of possible intents? Is there one preferred way to handle every situation, or does it vary depending on the context of the request? In other languages there is an ""intents-based"" approach to dialog, and I am trying to work out how this is implemented in the English language.
If the first part of this question has been answered here, please point me in that direction. I couldn't find it. Thanks!
[edit] clarification: I want to know the general principle and the underlying logic. How would my brain determine that the intent is card and not money if it were given the above scenario? I mean, how would I know? If the system knows what is best then I might not need to bother asking. If I can't figure it out, then what are some rules of thumb to determine which is most likely? 
[/edit]- clarification - I'm not asking how to find out an answer, but what would be the decision-making process that would lead to the conclusion.  For example, suppose I said: My card fell, I lost my keys. The context, however, suggests a change was made to my balance. My brain has processed the scenario in such a way that I conclude that there was a cash transaction. That's a good and efficient way of thinking. However, perhaps my friend says: You did not get your money back. And, again, the change has not been made, so my interpretation is that this transaction happened, even though it was not said in this context? What process do you go through to arrive at that conclusion? - clarification
Also, does intent differ based on different scenarios? Suppose I lose my wallet on a crowded street and ask if people saw it there. There are lots of different contexts - there can be an intent of ""find my money"", ""help me find lost money"" and ""look for my lost wallet"" (I am just making this up so don't take it seriously). How are they handled? My guess is, they are handled based upon context. In the former case, you might say: ""Did you"

Ben WJul 14 '11 at 22:48
I don't think that's how people actually interpret the phrase. I think the context here is that there's been a theft, and someone's getting their old card back and wants to know what to do with the new card. The new cards will be shipped to the thief (as that is what he will have to use to access the account) but the first card can simply be mailed to them as the last step in the process of regaining access. In my opinion that seems like the only plausible use of the sentence. It's hard to imagine a situation in where the person is looking for the theft victim to give them their card, which seems to be the meaning of ""old one"". So we can say ""Old one"", ""New one"" and ""Freeze one, then ship one to me""
There are two situations where ""Theft of cards, want to freeze and ship"" doesn't make sense, unless you're the victim of a heist. For example: ""I have the cards. Just freeze the stolen ones and send the originals to [name, email, or phone]. You'll have them soon"".
It's also possible that it's an ambiguous use and could mean either ""theft, old and I need new"", or ""steal of card"". In this sense the answer would be any of your suggestions. But if it were ambiguous, I would lean towards ""freeze and then send"" being the correct interpretation, because that scenario has the clearest meaning. (The thief has already stolen the card)
Also note: In a similar vein, ""Want to buy stuff?"", has different meanings and it is not as easily interpreted as these questions. ""Do you want something?"", ""Where do you live?"", etc... could all mean different things
Hope that helps. Feel free to comment if you disagree. :)

I've noticed a common trend in my own writing: people will use the term ""stolen credit."" I've seen people use that before a noun or a verb, and I suspect it was used because it's the easiest way to convey the word ""theft"" without it being too specific.
But I just looked at the Urban Dictionary and found this entry about ""Stolen Card,"" which is very good. It's one of the better ""definitions"":
""A stolen Card is an item that a individual is not the owner of. Stolen Cards can be anything from a credit/debit card, to cash and anything else. A thief or vicitim of Card Stealing will often go through the victim's entire wallet and take out any cash they find. This is a crime of opportunity, because the Victim isn't going to stop a thief at such a low level crime. Usually, an individual must have lost something valuable to be considered a Victim."" --
http://urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=st...
It's worth reading a few pages, it goes into a lot of different types of theft:
""[A card is] a very common object that thieves steal from people. [It is also] [t]he name of a specific category of crime, in which the item targeted by a criminal is stolen but no monetary gain is realized."" (from http://www.urandictionary... )
And the entry also says ""a crime where items are stolen without monetary values."" So in the context of this discussion, where I would use a definition, maybe I should just use'stole"
154,how do i report a stolen card?,"['report card', 'stolen card', 'stolen card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","stolen credit card find stolen information report stolen car report?

Answer: I'm not so sure there is any single ""best"" answer to this question, but we can discuss the options.
One approach is to think of each answer as a potential ""intent"" (or ""goal"" or ""objective"") for your question. 
As such, I would say that the intent of your original question is, ""how do I report my credit/card to a place/company?""   You'd then go on to ask a second question as part of the same dialog, to specify the desired outcome, which might be ""I want to get my card replaced"".
If we think about the answers to your questions in this context, we see that there are several different ""intents"" and associated ""targets"" from your perspective. You may also have an objective in mind, such as ""report the missing card and get it replaced.""
In this case, your options will be somewhat different, as your desired outcomes (i.e., the objectives) will dictate a different set of ""goals"" than those which the answerers have in their mind. Thus, it might behoove you to consider your ""target objectives"" in advance before asking the question and then choosing to narrow down your choices, when it comes to the different options, until you end up with only two or perhaps three options which seem to meet a set objective."

If the user has the ""need help"" intent (as you would expect) then they might also have the need to help intent and the I need intent. The I Need and Need to Help are pretty much just variants of the same concept. ""I need your help"".
In addition, the verb ""steal"" has many meanings and there are some other verbs like steal, stealt, stealing, thieve,... which have similar but slightly different meanings. So, you can also be ""looking for someone who has thieved"". Which one do you need?"

I’m struggling with the exact wording here - because all three are possible causes of an uttering the word ""stolen"". In the latter two, the intent is implied in the context of utterances being made - that the card has actually been stolen and that it is being frauded.

← Is it possible to ask about both the stolen-card and the fraud cases? Or just ask specifically about what I wrote above: ""all three causes can be present at once""?
This may be a duplicate, but I can't find it with a simple search. Sorry!

...
In this case, it would probably be the case that all are present, so I would say that a better phrasing would be for the question you're looking for would have been: What's the difference between the four scenarios? This is basically asking a question about the different causes (I'm not trying to suggest they're mutually exclusive, just that I am not sure any of them could be used for a sole cause).
A question with two causes may also be asked by saying: How would you describe these cases to the police? And then you could ask the same questions that you asked about all scenarios. This may or may not work, depending on how the original question was asked, etc. For example, maybe you are looking to get the meaning of the words ""lost"", ""theft"", etc., in these different scenarios without any reference to whether any one cause might have led to it being uttered. I suppose that in a case like that, you might need the answers as a whole. In short, I don't know if all that makes sense. It's mostly a shot in-the-dark that's led me to this. Hope it helps. Cheers! :-)
The question may depend on which language is spoken - for example if you were to say: My credit card was stolen! I could get answers that might look at all four cases:
1) credit-steal -> stolen
2) theft -> card missing
3) identity-thief -> theft
4) fraud -> fraud
5) none of above -> no idea
There are other options available to you"
159,help me please!  my card was stolen!,"['help ', 'stolen card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?",", help stolen? or help please?

Is it an option, to use 'please' only when asking for help, because it's more polite than the other options and also because 'help' can be asked for without using a sentence starting with 'I' (eg: ""What's the number of the taxi driver?"")
What about the case where we need help in expressing a specific request, e.g.: I want you to give me a good job, please.
Do the same rules apply when I use the imperative mood or when it makes no sense to start the sentence with ""I"" (but the verb is indeed ""give me"" and not ""what about you"", etc).
And if I don't want to express a request explicitly, what is correct: *I'm hungry. Help me to eat. or *Help me eat? (and if so, under what circumstances?)
Thanks a lot,
Michele
EDIT: After rereading some of my questions, it seems that ""please"" should be used whenever I ask for something, including requests. Therefore, I have changed the tag ""asking"" in the original question to ""request"".
I have also deleted the question because the answers provided are now useless. 
Thank you for your help!
PS: I am really sorry for any grammar mistake made! I hope that some kind soul will correct me. (This was not my question but my answer to it)   Edit : I would still accept @mjn's answer as it answered my original questions. Thank you!"

Xavier's right, the second example is more specific. And if you look, ""account for yourself"" is ambiguous, because who do you account to? What kind of account is it?

If you need an example where there are too many options, take a look at this answer: http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/41008/are-they/41135#41137
There are a couple of choices where more of a general idea can't be specified. If you don't think they fit in, just ignore them. They don' hurt, anyway. :P
(Also: I don’t know if it‘s possible to create tags. I“m not familiar with the technical details, but I guess a mod might know something.)
-1. (I'm not entirely sure if this belongs on the page or not). I think you're right to point out that some examples are not so specific as they could be. There's room for improvement in that regard

161,how young can i be to open my own account?,"['open account', 'own account', 'open account']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","How about these alternatives? 1) How young is it to own a property? (1.6) open-account
2)How old is too old to have a pension?(10) pension-owning
3) The government is considering raising the age for receiving benefits.
Which of the above is more appropriate to use as the main verb?

I'm a bit torn on this... I don't know that it makes sense to be opening a new account... But the more relevant question here is: what is an account anyway? It sounds like what you're asking is ""If I'm 18, is there a limit to how old I can be in order to become an owner of an investment account?"" which would be an excellent topic to bring up if it was part of a course. I would probably say in the affirmative in that case, because I wouldn't want someone that young to control something that's potentially large in value. It'd sound like a terrible idea. However, it sounds more like you'd just be checking if there were any age limits for owning a checking account. You might ask if an adult is permitted to check an 18 year-old's bank account, but I think it wouldn' really be your question. That would also depend on the kind of bank: some will allow adults to handle accounts as long as they're an authorized signature holder, while in others it would require an age restriction to even be allowed to touch the account in any way. So maybe it's more of just a question of age to qualify you to take out an existing checking/savings account with their bank. If they do so, you may as well ask ""When is a person no longer allowed access to their own bank/checking/debit card/etc?"" because they are effectively an ""adult"" at that point."
162,how old do i have to be?,['have '],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","Given the utterance: how old do i have to be?. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: have?, know? and ask?? A simple answer to this question would be: 'how old are you?' but how accurate is that answer? This is an essential question, but one where answers are often ambiguous and even contradictory. One view is to say that the correct answer is 'I am five' in the case of a five year old, 'i am ten' for a ten and so on. However, this is far too simplistic, as many people's age varies from decade to decade. A more nuanced view would claim something along the lines of'she's five, which I would take to mean: 5 years old'. In this case, the person is 5 rather than just 5. On the other hand, it also makes some amount of sense to claim that 'five' is a natural number like 7. In fact, both of these views have at least some plausibility depending on the way one views natural numbers. Here I'm going to argue for the first view because it has the potential to do a better job of capturing all the various kinds of answers that people give in this situation. First let's look at how the two options I mentioned perform. Consider someone with a current age of 10. She will say 'ten' when asked how much older she is than a 5 year child. By this token, she will also say 10 when told that she's ten years older than someone who is four. This suggests that if the question 'How old?' is replaced with 'Which of the next two statements is true': 10 years is how older your age is compared to 5's. 10 is older. I will now argue that this means that 10 should be taken to denote a property just like any other natural property. So, on that view, 10 denotes the age property associated with 10 and not, say, a number value property (like the number 10). This will enable us to capture all cases of statements like that I've mentioned. Suppose someone says 'Ten is what I am older then you are' or 'Five is younger than I'. On this reading, they are making the claim: 10, what is my age as compared with yours?, 5, your own age. Both of those statements have some intuitive appeal. We could easily say: the one who's older, i.e. ten, is ten. But I don't see how one could make"
163,can i open an account for a child?,"['open account', 'open child']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","open kid's account.

This is not a rhetorical question. I have a kid who is about to start school. This school is a bit of a struggle. We have no bank account because my partner was a drug addict and I had to fight tooth and nail to get a restraining order. My partner has been kicked out of his house, has an extremely long history of arrests including a felony for burglary, and we were both in rehab. He is currently on supervised probation. And while he's been sober for 4 years, there are still some things that he hasn't gotten over. One of which is that there was this woman in his life who would let him do whatever he wanted and didn't have to pay him back. There was even this incident where when we needed to sell a car and a guy from the junkyard showed interest, she took it there (this was back in 2011). There are also some financial issues, as my ex-partner doesn't work and relies on my assistance and the fact that a lot of things he used to have are just in my name that I could be responsible for. So the question becomes: should we set up a bank/credit card account at the school for my kiddo, given the aforementioned. If not, what should I do?
My partner says that she won't be able to afford to help us with the bills and that we should just pay cash. She's right. But I just want my son to be safe and have the tools to manage. The schools are asking for everything from a birth certificate to SSN. It seems as if we can set things up for him, but there is so much we don't know. How does one go about getting a credit card (we have one for medical emergencies from when my child was born) with nothing but a SS number and birth date? 
Is this a case where we need to set a goal to become more independent, or is there something else I should be doing? What do you guys think? Any links, books, etc would be helpful. Thanks!

164,how old do we have to be?,['have '],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","Given the utterance: how old do we have to be?. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: have? (1) have been born?, or (2) will be born (?)

We propose that the answer to the above question depends on the questioner, with an answer from ""no upper bound"" (i.e., the answerer has no preference) to ""we will soon have an upper limit"" or ""the oldest anyone ever has been"". This is because of the distinction we draw between the first person as subject and the second person: the subject of a sentence is often not the person of that sentence (we discuss this further and argue that it's this distinction that accounts for the fact that people don't seem to know how to talk about the age of other people (see ""The Age of Others"", below).
The question ""how old are you?"" will have different answers based on how the speaker regards the addressee(s). If the ""you"" is construed as ""I"", the possible answers to how ""old"" are: (a) I haven't been ""born"" yet; (b) there's no upperbound; or, (c) when it becomes ""time"" for me to start living, I will.
If, however, the listener is regarded as being of equal status to me, so that we can both be addressed as subjects, there is no question about it:
I have just ""been born"", in the sense that I am now ""on this date of my life"", so I can be asked ""When will you be old enough?"", to find that ""No, when I stop playing around I guess it'll be the day I turn 40""
In short, whether you are being asked about your own age, your family's age or the ages of others, you should consider the possibility of answering with (e) ""there is an unspecified upper-bound"" -- or in other words, ""it's nobody's guess"" -, rather than with one of (d) or/and (f)."
165,how do i go about setting up an account for my daughter?,"['setting account', 'setting daughter']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","My thinking is that setting an acount should be treated as a specific entity, while setting a daughter should also be considered a more general entity (hence, it is not an appropriate intent for setting). However, I'm wondering whether there is a better way.
To give an example, when asking about ""how do I get to the beach?"", there could be multiple correct utterances. A first-pass interpretation of the question might include:
""How do get from my car to my home"", 
then ""How does the bus come from [my car's address, home's street, etc] to [the beach's location, my residence's]""?

The answer: A bus from the airport will come to a stop at the corner, and then you need to travel 1 mile and turn left."
166,is there an age minimum?,"['age minimum', ' minimum']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","I'm trying to understand what the intent is behind these sentences. 
Is there a difference between asking the minimum, or asking for the maximum age?  Is there some context that would make either a better fit, e.g.: age range? If they're asking about a maximum, how does one interpret the ""if any"" after maximum? What context could a minimum be used in that wouldn't imply a negative intent? Does the presence of the word ""minimum"" even make a semantic difference? It seems strange that I could say ""What's the age of your car?"".
To me as a native (Canadian) English speaker, the question ""is there minimum?"" seems to imply something different from the questions ""what's a lower bound"" and ""does there exist a upper bound?"".  I can't help but feel that they have different connotations.
In addition:
What does an ""intent"" mean in this context? I would say that there is a strong implication for there to be a lowest age for something. I don't see how saying 'no minimum' would be the same as saying ""there can be no maximum"", unless the context is that of a car. In that case 'there is minimum', implies that something has a smallest age, and 'can be maximum' is an alternative form for saying that a particular age doesn't need to exist. This may or may not be true. So I am not exactly sure what a'minimum' might imply. Does anybody have any insight? Or, is this just a quibbling of words and the meaning can only be determined from context in a given situation? Should one be looking at the words as being 'words' first, rather than considering the connotation of what it is talking about? Is this question a silly one? Am I even making sense? How would you ask this kind of question in the first place? (I've been trying it in my head all morning, but don' get the feeling that this is really what we should be doing. )  

  ""Is the car's age a range (e.x. 2 to 5 years)""

I've already seen this question answered here, and the answer seems to be ""it depends"" since the phrase in quotes has different senses in each case. I'd like to know whether there's a clear consensus on how to approach the issue, or whether we need to settle on a convention for the site.
The problem is that if we adopt a consistent approach for all these different cases, then there won't be any way to express the sentence ""I want to open a new savings / checking / credit card / etc account."" If we instead adopt an inconsistent approach, the ambiguity could be resolved by adding ""for my"" or ""my account"", but that would make the language more cumbersome. So what's the right way?
(I'm not sure whether my use of ""approach"" is appropriate. The best that I can do is to say ""the site should decide"").
EDIT:
Some of the answers below suggest splitting the question into different ones. Since it's not possible to split the original question because there is no clear-cut answer, that's also what I'll do in the form of answers. To make it easier to compare, I will split my question up into: for your account, for mine, etc. 
My first two answers are a simple case of how the OP wants to use the phrases. Then we have the case where the user asks someone else to help her, in which case the context determines the appropriate wording. My last three answers (by @Nigel Ren) cover all those cases. It's hard to decide which of his answers is best, but I think it has to do with how well he's captured all the situations I was aiming to cover. Anyway they're all worth reading. :)

This way you make it clear that you want to know what someone's current age (age) is. If you use age in the plural you could get into trouble. ""How many ages are there? There are two ages, the age of the universe and the earth (earth). The earth is four and a half ages old, which is about 6 billion years old"".
I'd also consider adding the modifier: ""my actual"", which would help make the first example clearer. For example, ""I just turned 21"" instead of ""When I was 21 I... I have been 21 years..."""

(I don't know why, but the question mark here suggests this may be the right one), make this user account, make a new user? Can you explain?

If I am using an NLP approach (and this can always be a question), how do you think about this, e.g. do I have to take the intent of making the user a first (or do the words make/making the same, in the context of the sentence) and then make it? I'm aware that there are many other ways to interpret an utterances, just need some help here
Thanks
PS: I know there is also the word created but it doesn't fit with the above example
Update: Thank you, I see now you are saying that this is not related to my question as I was trying to do, so the answer for that question is No, creating is different from making.
The second question I think is similar here. 
In an example, given the sentences, which is correct?  I hope I don´t have too many questions. I will make sure that when I need the next help, to be more clear about what I want. Thanks. (If any sentence is wrong feel free to edit)
Example:
i made an event, my brother is coming, do i have a place to host the event? or,  i made a booking, on the 19th i should have an appointment? Is there any difference between those sentences? The thing that confuses me the most here, is I read an article and the difference seems to that is if I said, i booked the date, it would mean the hotel made the booking or I booked. And for some reason, the latter one seems more correct. If someone can explain this to me in some more details, that would also be great. My main concern is that I can´´make´ the appointment in this particular case. Thank
I am aware this sounds quite trivial but I´m still learning. Sorry for this but thanks again if you can help at least with one of them. :)

173,could i open an account for my children?,"['open account', 'open children']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","open a bank account? i don’t think so.

i am quite confident this is a grammatical mistake. It seems it would be an appropriate question to ask at a store, for an errand, on the road, or in an unfamiliar place. But as a general question it seems wrong to me. I am interested to know if this opinion is shared. If I were asked this, I would reply, “I don't think I could”, but then I realize how silly this reply sounds and say, ""I can. In fact I do"".
So my question is: is this question wrong, and if so what, precisely, is grammatically correct or incorrect about it?
I know I may well be making this out as though I know more than I actually do, as I don'[t, at least not yet. Perhaps this will help. Here's the question: What does it mean for this statement to be 'grammatical' or 'ungrammatical'? What sort of error, grammaring or syntactical is it or is not? (or is both?)
If it is ungrammatically expressed, what should be changed to make it acceptable? Is there some rule about when this sort 'question' is acceptable, when it's 'okay' to express an opinion? Or is that not a well defined term, that people disagree on? 
Perhaps it depends on 'acceptable' being interpreted as 'not offensive'?
Thanks to all those who reply!
To summarize,   is there a rule or standard as to when such a question becomes or does not become 'appropriate' in context? It's easy enough to answer, say 'no', but what about 'yes'? Or, to phrase it again, does there exist a standard for the usage of 'could you' when asked about someone or something. Or are opinions, just, well, opinions? And what's that 'just, 'well, ', 'opinion?' in this context: what standard is operative? I'm still not sure about that.  (I'm trying to avoid the implication that I have opinions). And again thanks for any answers you may have. (It's my first question)

Open account. Do you need to open an acocunt for a kid? It should be a checking acount. You could set up a business account, and then just add a child to the business's acoount, but the parent could end up with a million in credit card debt if the kid does anything stupid like maxing out their acacount and making a dozen purchases on a creditcard. If you're just opening an checking account and giving the child a debitcard, they are liable for any transaction on the card, which means you could get hit if they go bankrupt or something. And then the bank probably would just cancel your kid's card anyway, so there's no point. An individual acct for each kid is a good compromise. They get a bank account for themselves, no liability for the parents to go into debt. Just open the ac account at your bank. Don't use the ATM or debit card though, because if it gets stolen, the fraud will end at the end of your ac acounthttp://www.askthebof.org/how-to-setup-a-checking-acct-and-give-it-off-yourself/

There are many different kinds of accounts in which a business or individual can engage. For many, the main reason for engaging in financial management is to make sure that they have an organized system for managing all of their financials such as credit cards, checking, money market, savings, and retirement plans in an efficient manner. However, not everyone needs to engage in the financial aspect of an organization.

A:
The best fit is Open Account. This is because this intent is to start an existing account. If the account doesn't exist, it needs to create a new account (which would be an action) and the intent was to make payment (or close).
However you can use the Open account action, but you would have a different flow. Instead you should handle the scenario as if you were opening an empty account with nothing in it.
As such you don't need an intent as your only intent would probably be Open."

This paper addresses the task of finding an answer to the question posed above by using a linguistic perspective approach (i.e. a syntactic and semantic perspective of a sentence's meaning). I argue that this is a more precise task than looking at the word choice of the speaker. I will also argue in this paper that the linguistic approach should be used in order to find an appropriate answer for the example sentence posed. The syntactical and semantical approach to answer the given sentence can be done with the use of English grammar (or with rules of semantics) in a natural language.
What is Language? A brief introduction to what I believe are the three main points to be considered in the linguistics approach. These points are:
1. Form, Structure and Meaning. (I'll be looking into how they can provide an effective answer of my question)
2. Language Structure. This can show the relationship of sentence parts. It provides a basis for meaning. But there are several approaches to this, with some being more or less effective. However, some approaches might be a bit overkill for my case or might only be suitable for an extreme case. As for example: (This is my idea of how the structure/function relationship should work) The idea I am looking for: A relationship that makes the sentence part as the function be related to it's form or structure, and the form in that case, to make the meaning more accurate. 
3. Semantics, meaning and intent. In this category, I would also like to discuss what are different meanings to different types of intent for a certain sentence. For example, are there different semantic meanings for different words used to express the exact same meaning? In that way, it will help answer how to look at word usage, in relation to certain types or forms of sentences, for finding out how effective a given intent really is. Or for instance, is there any intent behind the fact that certain words are used, that have different forms? For this case it would give an example like: ""I offered children the opportunity for money-saving experience"" in which there is no real, or any intended, use for child (as the only use I found here was that of an argument to another sentence and it should have been in plural). The meaning"

However, this intent would only match the sentence in the context of a very specific use of your. The intent if child used service, would be the more likely intent for such an ad.
However, both of these intents would require more information than just the number of years old. This number is more than likely to vary. How do you expect the child's age to affect the service used? The service is likely the age-range that is being offered (e.d. if it is a service that only allows kids to play video games, you would want the ad to target a range that the kids under 13 should be excluded from, not any other age range, because 13 is an easy cut-off point).
So, it would make sense to provide as many relevant attributes as possible - and as little irrelevant attributes. That would mean, in this specific example, providing your age, the range of ages that you are targeting, how the ages vary (i.e, does your price vary based on age? do children of varying age buy different toys?) and what the children are likely able to do with the product you provide.

What is your definition for the term “intent”? Intent is not the same thing as purpose (the same as what is said in your examples); it is usually an internal mental state. I am using here the standard one that is defined in the ’99 version of CMA-301 (I don‚t have access to the 2012 edition; can you please tell me if it has the changed). Intent should be considered a linguistic and linguistic-based process, so that the meaning of the verb does not only depend on its syntactical structure or the semantic content of its arguments.
“Open an account for her‌ ‍„‖‪own account is ambiguous‬‏‰ since it‹does› ‘′not necessarily―mean that‒her/‥account
Should we not use „intentions‟ when talking about meaning? Or would that be using the language of semantics in a language that should talk more explicitly about semantics? For example: I have intentions that I buy chocolate for dinner. Should we say that? (Or: do we have to use the word ‚intention‛ in those cases? Are the intentions part of our own mental states? Do they even exist?) If I was the one saying them, I would definitely say something like ″I have the intention that‫ I ‬buy chocolate ”. But we do not talk like this in real life, do you think? I‱am a bit‭confused here about‮semantics‡

181,how old do you have to be to get an account?,"['get account', 'get account']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?",", get my account?, create account, and register to have account.
What if the given utterances included the additional information that you could make an unlimited number of accounts? 
How should the ontology of these entities change (if it changes at all), and if it is even necessary?
I'm not asking that the account be associated with someone or something, I'm simply wondering about the relationship between entities. Do they exist independent of each-other, or are they just related through another entity (or entities if there are other types).   And why is that relevant, exactly? How does the existence of an entity help in understanding how something is intended? (e.g. ""I have an Account"" is not what is meant by ""Accounts"" but it could be understood as a shorthand of ""an account"" and that understanding is useful)
This is what I have, but I am not confident in it at this point. Is this how it should be? I.e., does Account exist independently and has a relation to User? If it exists independently how should I represent this? The relationship is a ""has a user"" relationship, right? What if ""accounts"", and not the ""user"", are an additional entity? Would this be correct? Should Account be a parent-child relationship of User (so as to not duplicate any other entities, i.a ""person"" (user) and ""house""?)
If the User is an individual entity, a relationship entity should not be part of it (is this correct?) and this leaves ""isAccounting"" as the only relationship. But does that make ""register a username"" or ""create account on the website"" ambiguous? It seems to me that ""User"" must have another (child) entity as I can't think of a reason that would be valid that an ""individual"" would have a (parent-) (relationship) type entity.  So does ""Individual"" also have its own relationship with ""Relationship""?

A:
It's an interesting question. I'll try and give you some insights based on my experience. When I do natural language processing for account based business solutions I always try to avoid using a separate relationship table for accounts. In a relational database I would say that accounts and users are in the same entity and they"

A:
–
The sentence “I would to have an X for a child to play with”

So you could say „I need to find a way to provide for the needs of the little one(s)“."
184,can my children have their own account?,"['have account', 'own account', 'have account']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","; own the account own accounts; my account has account.

In terms of its truth conditions, can own is more restrictive than its complement, have, and has a stronger contrastive effect with has than the contrast between have and its complements [i.e. possess a good, be happy with (etc.). This explains in what sense is can more ""strong"" than have in the given example. 
If you have your own bank account, then, by default, you also own your bank. You can, however, transfer ownership to someone else - and, even though this is a very common usage, it is usually best to state ""I transfer my ownership of my/my bank's account to (the bank)"". This means that it would also make sense to say that one may own ""the account in my own name"" in cases where one would not necessarily own one's bank itself; for instance, one can also sell ownership in an account owned by one person to another while that second person continues to be the actual custodian of the money. In fact, many people have more than one ""personal"" bank accounts, with the funds in each of these often going to entirely different places in a way which would be impossible if they were all owned, or even ""held"" (as one might put it), by the same person."

I've been trying to think of the most suitable intent to describe a given situation, and I'd like to know whether I'm missing a more appropriate one.
For example:
If an agent opens a new account, it is not appropriate to ask whether it should be opened to children. However, a question that would be very appropriate is ""What are your plans for children?"".
In a situation like this, where there's no clear intent that a service could satisfy, what's the appropriate thing to do - to try and get the agent in question to reveal their intent? If they've never thought to express any intentions, does that mean a human needs to intervene? Should the system ask for an intent anyway? Or something else? Is there a standard or accepted practice that handles this? Are humans just making it up as they go along? :-)
EDIT: I understand that this is a pretty open-ended question. That's why I've edited it to make it more focused. My question is specifically about a case that's a bit different. It's not really about the use of intents with chatbot or NLP, so please don't take it that way. I hope this clarifies matters. :-)

What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","; open bank account of X years? Where X is not fixed and can be an instance of an entity or a numerical value (for example, X can stand for the age of the speaker).

The problem can also be formulated as: ""Do we have a single best answer for each X? How can we answer that for many Xs?""
We can start out looking at ""open account"" as just the verb ""to open,"" which has the answer ""any age."" But the real question is what do we mean by opening ""an account""? We can think of a ""bank account."" Then the question becomes whether we are talking about a traditional savings account, or whether the bank we open our account with is a digital bank such as an online savings and/or checking account. In this case, the intent of ""opening an accounting system"" would be that it is possible for a bank to ""track"" how much money someone has deposited for us, and how that total changes with deposits and withdrawals. We will discuss how to do this a little further down.
This problem was discussed at http://cogsci.stackexchange.com/a/12/1373 and https://ell.li/askell/question/638
I think that the OP is really interested more about the problem of deciding on an appropriate intent or schema for all of these cases. I also think there is something about that question that is making some people react in terms of:
""Why is this on ELU?"" Is it really asking about English or is it asking a computer science question?
That last point is an important one that I want to address with a couple of questions of my own. It is sometimes hard to determine a good question's intent. For example: What does the author really mean? In an EL site, we can often get a sense of that from the title, but in the case of Stack Overflow, titles can sometimes give misleading impressions. Sometimes the body of answers give more insight, especially with the ability to comment and vote. 
What the site does not give is any sort of indication of what is actually being asked. This means that we need to figure out for ourselves how we should interpret the asker's question. Is this really an English question, is that a CS question"
188,is there an age limit?,"['age limit', ' limit']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?",", age limits?...

A:
I would guess that this intent is ambiguous because in the sentence: Is there age limitation? the context indicates you are asking for a yes/no question about if the age is a limit, not if limits of age are a concern. As a result, it sounds to me like there's a range of ages for which you will be concerned. (If I'm wrong, let me know.)
That said, I think your intuition is correct that it's more natural to say: There are age limitations for X, than:There is an (age) limit for (X).
The difference is, you're not looking for an answer to your question. You're simply stating that the limitations exists. There is no right or wrong answer, since ""limits for...?"" can refer to limits or to restrictions or even to an amount of money."

Is this sentence good? If not why?  Thanks (but no need for your own sentence.) How do I fix it? (No I will not post my own version. Thanks for all those who do!  )   How would you fix this? How to use this structure? It's very good, thanks. It is good grammar -  I know how a sentence should look, and this is not it. Can u tell me what it is and how I should correct it so that it looks exactly like the sentence above? Thank you - it's not good English
Hi, how you doing? This is my email address if you want to send me anything. If you're an author I would buy all your books. You're a fantastic writer! Thanks - It was the worst English I ever saw - thanks for letting me know that, but could you tell where the mistake was? thanks - Is there a problem with this English sentence? Could I use it in a letter or an email? Please help - Could a non-native speaker help correct this mistake? Do you know what I meant? That is wrong, is it not? No? What would be a better word to replace that one? There is no such word, right? You are right. Thank God! - That's it! I've seen it used before. Where? Can you please provide the full sentence, word for word. This sentence does not make sense to me - How I do this correctly? When the verb in ""a thing"" is ""sign,"" does it change ""in a place"" to ""into a thing?"" This sounds wrong to my ear. Please confirm."

I think “have a specific child” seems to fit best, even though we’re using age as the criteria. I believe it‘s a parent or guardian intent because we wouldn‚Äôt want someone to say ‚€„I use ‘“their service―.‹, we have that as a possible scenario as well.

The answer, which you can find in the document ""Definitions"", is that you want to ask someone to request an information, or to make and request (with an infinitive) a request to donate to your cause.
In this case, ""open account"" is a bit weird. ""Open account for a company"" means, I think, that the person you ask will provide you information about the company. It's very uncommon to want someone's account to start with."

The second utterings party seeks to avoid the unwanted information.
We don't know any contextual factors which indicate whether the intent ""how old"" is more or less likely to lead to the result ""open account"" than the other three. 
Can you explain what contextual elements can help to distinguish the two intents? If there are none, how can we do that?   I think there is some difference between the intrests in this example, but I'm not sure if that difference can be expressed in the data which is what I need clarified. Can you confirm that the answer is, indeed, no? Or can you tell me where I can find that answer, as I have searched in vain...
(My question is a bit different than this one, which focuses on the difference in probability between two or more intests, and then tries to explain why, in that question, they are different, rather than which intention can lead which result.) Thanks!
Edit:
I would like to know if there's a way we can use to make it more specific. I want to say that there may be contextual information, or factors, other than intent which help us distinguish one intent from another. In that case, maybe I should ask how to go about finding them, not how we determine the probability of a result given an intent: it will be clear from context which intent is likely and which not. My concern is not the likelihood of that result, nor its probability given the particular intet,  only whether we CAN  tell which of the given intets are more likely than another to produce a particular result in a given context; or conversely, of course, whether some results are unlikely to follow a specific intent.

As I read the text, two thoughts struck me, one right after the other, as follows:
1. The first person has a better intention, than the second. But, what could be the intent of the first statement, that the speaker is not able to articulate? It is probably better to rephrase the question into: ""why does the statement 'What is X to you' require that X is a noun and not a verb?""
2. Is it possible that in (1), the subject has no specific intent? For the sake of convenience, let us assume they just say it out of habit (or because they are too young to know what a specific word means). Could we just leave the verb open and leave it to the reader to decide if the intention is to say that one can open or a person could open for the account is opened?
I could see the former but I think for such a context it is better not to leave too many gaps to be filled in at the expense of readability.
Which one of these should be better? What could have happened to my original question? And how do you deal with such things?  
Edit: My original intention was to find a solution for this situation which is applicable in such situations when we use a subject that has multiple verbs. I did not have in mind this particular example. If it was, I could also have asked how to deal if I had to express that a child can't open something and I know that what he says is 'the first' person he ever used.  I guess in that case it would be more appropriate to just state that we say so, out-of-hand, without any specific meaning and for whatever reason. In that sense, it could not be expressed in the present tense and therefore it can only apply in past or other times. Maybe the example given could serve as an example of this, even if not strictly a present time situation. Or the way you would say the same thing to your child, when he asks how he can 'open something'. If you answer him saying 'you cannot open anything' it will be a rather bad answer, in my opinion, because you will say something that isn"

The correct answer is 1) have, because bank is not a subject and therefore cannot follow an object like accounts; 2) there is no correct fit because accounts is a predicate and not an objective pronoun, so it cannot come after bank; 3) you can't use the indefinite article for the whole because then you would need to use it for each of the parts of bank, which you cannot, since it is an entire thing; 4) the only correct sentence using an indirect object pronoun is with a preposition, not with an absolute pronoun.

The best-fitting intent is ""I'm getting blocked"".
It will help the system better understand what is actually being asked, which will lead to better answers.
If there would be too many of those, you might want to split it to:
- I'm trying to get my blocked credit card, [i'm blocking my accounts]
In this case, the second phrase will have its own intent (i.e, trying)

Hi,
Thank you for asking a very valid question here. Since my
knowledge isn't too deep about this, I want to clarify this for you.
Let's have a look to these different actions:
Actions: 'use card', 'bank', and'reset',
Intents: Reset the card. This intent will only be executed on
a PIN entry device. The PIN should not work on the magnetic stripe. I
think this is a safe action because your PIN is safe and there are
only a few situations in which you cannot execute this action: The
PIN length is not set up properly. You are entering the PIN with a
keyboard. If these conditions are met, we ask the user in the
dialog whether he wants to activate a security action or cancel it
immediately. In this second case, no further PIN will be required. No
response is required for 'Reset the bank'. If the account is inactive
and no action is already active (i.e. a 'Use card' action exists, but
no PIN has been entered), this intent is automatically executed. For
details, see the section 'Using a PIN on PIN Entry Devices' in
[http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-input/][1] or in any tutorial on web
speech. (The intent 'Bank' should be handled in a similar way as the '
'Use bank' intent. There are several other actions which will also
be executed, namely: the action 'Activate', the actions
'reinstate' and the intent
'manual'.
We are currently working on an enhancement to the Dialog Manager. We
are working towards adding an automatic reset. That means the dialog
will automatically be aborted and restarted without any interaction
of the person. When the next intent in dialog is executed and
there's no response, the automatic action will happen again. Of cause, this
must not occur on every'Reset' or'Activate' request. It should only
happen in situations where it is absolutely
required. As this enhancement will not be
ready yet, it will take some time until this feature will land. Once
it's"

The intent of the speaker is to ask the audience to assist the person to achieve some goal or end, for example, “You can help.” ” If you don't have an appropriate intent for your question, then you have probably not mastered the art of English or, at the least, you need a refresher in it. You can’t just ask, What‘s your meaning?“. If the question contains a request or opinion it might not work. The only way to tell if your questions are rhetorical, or not, is through context. A rhetorical rhetorical questions usually contain some kind of emotion that can be felt from the statement, which is a key component that makes these questions different from other types of questions. For instance: Is it ok to lie to my friend? Is there a difference between rhetorical and rhetorical. In rhetorical, there is usually an emotion involved.

A blocked PIN number is a PIN that you can't access your account for various reasons, and you may want to make use of the blocked option. A blocked or blocked for fraud PIN is used by banks for a variety of reasons. Blocked phone numbers are phone lines that can be used for account recovery purposes by customers with lost or stolen. I don't know if this would work but you could try calling the numbers in your order. If they are working numbers call these and see if you get any responses. Please post the number as well so that we can help you more. The blocked phone line is probably for the same purpose that blocked accounts are for, so you would just be giving the bank the chance to contact you and ask you what the problem was. Hope that helps?

This answer is incorrect. There are no general rules that you can use to guess the intent of natural language, so you have to ask around and/or consult other people. For example, someone with experience working in bank systems might be able to tell you exactly what you need to do to get a new pin. Or they might tell someone in human relations so that someone can tell the customer. And someone at the ATM might help you out if they get some time. So you just need a bunch of people you trust or an organization you've worked with in the past. Even if there are generalizations, they depend on the specifics. That being said, the most obvious intent would be to say: ""I think you mean that I have a pin that is not acceptable"". In this case, you should ask for the pin or try to enter it again. This way you do not risk being charged for an incorrect pin for example. Otherwise it is hard to know that the PIN was wrong and what your intent was. It is better to avoid getting charged than risk getting caught. Of course there can be other cases where you might want to charge the person, or it might make sense to not charge if it was a mistake. The point is that it really has to be decided on an individual basis. I would advise you to talk to someone, and then ask if this is a general rule of some sort. You might also be interested in reading How does the Turing test (or the Loebner prize) differ from the AGI test? on this site. If you want you could try the answers in comments on that post.

216,how do i deal with a blocked pin?,"['blocked pin', 'blocked pin']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","is blocked? what is a locked pin?, locked?

A:
The following is an attempt to answer this question: How do I deal 
with a pin being blocked?,   what to expect.
As noted in the comments:  The question as to why a block occurs is not a question
of machine learning and is more of a human question, such as, why is there a  block here? The machine will not provide the answer to this, though  it can provide reasons for why it happens.  This is left up to the human and/or
business analysts. This question is intended to provide information that a business analyst can
use to help them analyze why some pins are blocked. There are two cases that are most often encountered: a
pin being locked and a single pin on the top side of the machine being ""blocked"".
If a pins being in a state of ""locked"" is being encountered, you will most likely  hear a ""Locked""
audio alert and you can usually access the pin using any of your methods. However, sometimes the user
wishes to use the method that ""unlocks"" a lock and this is done by ""Unlocked"".  It is possible
that the locked state may be an ""active state"" meaning that the lock is active but not yet  in an unlocked  state which means that you  need to  unlock the  machine for  access to unlock  the
locked pin. An example of this would be that an employee has put a piece of paper over or into a machine to
keep it from working for a temporary period of time and so the paper has become ""block"". The paper  must
be removed, the ""lock"" turned to ""on"", and then the action of unlock can be taken. Sometimes,  this may  take  more  than  one  action  to achieve  as  there  may
occasionally be a combination that doesn't unlock. It really depends on how the software is  written  and  can  often
become a matter of trial and error on why one method doesn’t unlock while another does. For example, an
employee may have placed their paper under the punch in line pin  that was already ""disabled"" which is why
they had to add the additional action"

Dear Michael,
A citation is a ticket that states you have been cited for a civil violation, e.g. parking, moving violations, or other civil violations. It states: the citation number, date on which violation occurred, violator's name and address, violation description, time & date violation was reported, officer name, charge, fine, court date and location of hearing. If you need this information, contact the court where you were cited. You may find contact information in the citations you receive. They are usually included in your citation. Also, you may request a Copy of the Citation by writing to the Municipal Office at City Hall. Make sure to include the name of citation, name & address of person receiving citations and court in which they occurred in order to verify the information. The Municipal Clerk then forwards the Request for Copy to COPIACERT, which in turn delivers a certified copy to your requester. Hope this helps, I know how annoying the process is!

My feeling is that none of them is particularly good, and i have a sneaking suspicion, that it doesn't work to do all three.
I'm wondering what the appropriate way to handle a case involving all 3 are. 
To me, all of the above seem a bit ""wrong"" as though i'm trying to be overly-precise, which isn't really an issue given the fact that the user is only interested in finding one option that they've exhausted. But, i do like the notion of trying all options at once, but my gut is telling me that one of these sentences is ""too-broad"", and that there is a better way of expressing this in english. Is my intuition here correct? Is there any grammatical mistake i may have missed that would make it impossible to express the intended meaning? Or should i simply say what i mean as is?

Update: This is my preferred solution:
1) ""i've tried my try it a few times now. is there anything else i should be trying?""
2) ""[i've] tried a try/try it. [is there] anything you should try?"" (the latter is not used much in practice).
3) ""(i'd) tried trying try or trying the try, is [there something] else you can check?""  (this sentence doesn' really make sense, unless you're referring to some kind of testing that can be done with the pin)  Also, it would be good to try to avoid making a pun with ""try"" here, ""is [someone] trying their try in the dark?"" is much better. You're still asking ""what is something they could try.""

A:
""unlock tries"" - if the user has pressed ""unlocked"" too often, the server should unlock the account.
This can be expressed by the intent ""Unlock"" with parameters  ""tries"", ""pin"".
The ""many tries""-case might be handled by ""Pin-manyTries""

And that's not to mention the possibility that the user's card was stolen and replaced, or that they had the old card stolen out from under them. I'm not sure what to make of these cases
So I'd think ""help!"" is a good starting point. You could try asking for information on the pin number, but if they haven't got it to begin with, the chances of them remembering it in sufficient detail for you to extract it are slim. And asking them for the code is likely to be perceived as ""prying"", which may not be an appropriate thing to do in this situation. So the only other option is to ask for their account number (and/or ask to use your phone, which I suspect is much more likely than your card), and then request a replacement, then wait and see what the response is. (Although it's also not impossible that you'd get a response that this was something you could have expected, e.g. ""I have a pin, it should be in my email"" - in which case it would obviously work to say ""okay. Can you send me your email?"")
If you had a phone number and could call and speak to them, this would be the most appropriate course to take; it won't be perfect as they may tell you their pin in response, so you'll have to try to piece things together from that, as well as asking if their phone's been stolen, in case they've forgotten their PIN (which is quite possible) - but it'd be a much better response than just a ""you're locked"". You'd only be asking information you already know, because they'd have told you what their card looked like, where it was, when their last PIN entry was and all that; you can use that information to get your PIN number. Then if you get it, you use it and they get the email. If you don't get anything, they don;t get their email, at which point you're back to the ""You're Locked"" scenario, with no phone or account info available to you. A phone"

UPDATE
My understanding about intent matching is not right. For each one of the examples:   un-block, to-unblock; unlock, for-me, and I-don't-know-which,  I get the same results: the first example matches for the Intent Filter that you provided and for every intent that are not included in that I have no results. But if I change my Intent-Filter for a broader range of Intents, like: ""call"" ""message"" my first intent is included and matched and second doesn't, third, fourth and so on...
The problem is that the results are only partial for each intent. If un blocking the pin is one, I'm trying to get to know whether the other intants would be able.  Can I use the full list of intents and match everything and get everything? Or do I need to limit the possible intant? If yes, which one? Is it correct to use ""Unblocke Pin"" for ""unblockingpin""?

I think this has been answered, but I can't find the source at the moment. My own solution is to have a general intent (or a few general intetns) that will capture the most common cases. Then you can have many sub intets that handle the specific cases that you want covered.

229,what can you do to unblock my pin?,"['unblock pin', 'unblock pin']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","; unblocked my PIN? (or is there a more specific variant?)
How to handle the situation of ""unblocking"" something which is never blocked?

A:
– How can I un-block [something]?  
[Something] is something in a certain location which blocks the way.  [Location] may be a door, a gate, or an entrance to a building, but it may not be the whole building.
There are a variety of ways to ask someone to unlock such a location for you. For example:  ""Can you get a ladder and unlock the gate?"", ""How can [I] unlock it?"", or ""What can we do about [it?].
Unblocking a pin is a common use case. It could be something as simple as opening a padlock, gate or a cabinet. You could do a variant with the ""pin"" part and ask ""what can be done to get the pin out of the lock?"".
If it is possible for a user to lock and then unlock a specific block, then the intent is clear. If it's not possible to block a particular place, you would have to say something like ""is there something that blocks this way?"". In this case, ""get it open?"" would be better. However, it would also be possible with ""can you unlock this [way?]"". That would depend on whether your app is designed such that it can only be open from one place. But in that case you can ask, for example, whether you are allowed to leave the building from the location you want to open."

232,how do i reset my pin?,"['reset pin', 'reset pin']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?",", clear pin?, reset?, set?

The utterances above, I believe, could all represent the same intent; reset/clear/set, respectively.
What would be the most intuitive response to each of them? 
For example, what will be triggered if the intent is reset? will i get the response ""okay, we'll send you your pin""?. Should i expect to get an error message if i use the set intent? and so on? Or will I be able to set the pin just fine and the message will just be ""your pin was reset"".   In my opinion the first two utterments (how do I reset?) should be used interchangeably, and i would expect both to behave similarly. On the other hand set shouldn't trigger ""set"" because set is already used in the question as a verb for set, but set should make sense with the sentence ""I want to delete my pins""
I also want the answer to be as accurate as possible, so please include examples of what could be different outcomes if you are unsure. Thanks
PS: My usecase is an Alexa skill. So please feel free to assume any skill with these utterings, e.g. ""What happened to my account?"" ""How do you know me?""  etc.  Or even better, some of these examples are from an actual skill: ""Help me, i lost my password"", ""Delete all my stuff"" etc
PPS I'm aware of the ambiguity problem but I don't have any alternative uttering to the ""how to"" ones. Maybe I could make ""help me"" more specific or ""delete all"" a little more general (if i were the skill writer). But this would mean that I would have to change all references to ""my things"" to something else and I want a universal answer. This is what makes me a bit skeptical that there's a good solution for this. I'd like it to work for all utterables (and not all intents) so that when I write a new one I won't need to do a whole new research if I choose the wrong one (which was my case with ""i lost the code"" utterment).

What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","A unblocking pin, which is a way to block someone’s phone number on an account, is one of the few things that I believe will be the downfall of our society. And I don‘t mean because of some dystopian future where every phone line is connected to a central authority and they track our every move for all of eternity and decide who we“re allowed to speak to or who is allowed on our social network. I mean that our current society will collapse because every conversation has been replaced by text messages.
If I call you on the phone and you don't answer, it makes you look like you are ignoring me. It makes my friends feel like they are intruding when they have no reason to be there. But if I text you, I am more concerned with whether you will reply or not, so I leave it for the most part because I feel more secure. So why are the people who are unblocked from using their pin so obsessed with blocking? Are they really being threatened? Is their phone more likely to get stolen than mine? If I was that worried about it, why would I un-block them? There are some very specific reasons why the un block is such a huge problem:
You can unban an individual phone from your phone without blocking, thus allowing the user to text freely on your network without any interruptions. You can use your own phone as a virtual un blocking device. This means that you can allow an un blocked phone to access your account. The device owner will only be able to see your messages though. If someone is un blocked from text messaging, they can message you. In the future, your un blocker will help you to hide your text conversations from view. There have been many instances over the years where a group of people un unblocks each other and text each others conversations, even though some of them were un aware that they un were blocked. Thats why its important to always block. Some un blockers even go as far is to change the text message format from the normal 160 characters to the longer 140 character format. They will then be free to message with those who have not un barred them. One person un blocks someone, but someone else unbars the person back.

I have a few questions about your question:
How do you know there are not other, more fitting intents? Did you use Google search to get examples of similar situations, or is there already a lot of information on your web site? Can I view your full question? I'm afraid my first answer has to be a negative, since we do not want to provide answers which are too short.
What would make your sentence into a question instead of an assertion? Could you post an example sentence, so I have something to try with? It would probably be much easier to give a good answer to such a sentence. I think your current sentence (in its current form as a request) would be better as: What's the proper way to request unblock this PIN number? and then a paragraph or two about PINs and the problems associated with them. This would also be good for you to research the topic yourself, to help you make a more informed answer. If I can view the complete question, I will take it into consideration, but I also want you or someone else to do the same so we all get good answers. You can send me a PM if you want. 
If I were you, before getting involved on this site, i would have researched the concept of intent and intent matching. For example, you could have done an online search and got more than 20 hits.

The problem seems like a very common situation and I'm having trouble to understand the semantics of the sentence. How do we classify it as: is or has it stopped?

A:
As pointed out by @user25355588, it is not grammatically correct. I have rephrased the first part of your question to reflect how I think it should be phrased: ""I am experiencing an issue. Is working contactless considered the same as working?"" Or, ""What is a fitting way of wording the second part if I wish to express that I am not experiencing any issue?""
In answer, I would say ""No."" I find the question difficult to answer because working contactsless isn't a real sentence by itself. You can say, for example:  ""The contactlessly operated door won't open."", but not, simply, working, contactorsless. In this case, you will probably have to explain further as it's not very clear what you mean. If you simply say working without further explanation, one might assume you're referring to the contact-operated kind of working and might not understand correctly what it means when you say contacts-less working has ""stopped.""
It might be better to rephrase the entire sentence with the real intent you wish the person to get from your sentence: something along the lines of,   I've been having issues using my card on all devices lately and now it doesn't work."

Which one of these would you think is appropriate?   And which intent do you find most probable? (If any?)
And which word/word phrase should replace work? I tried different variations, for example: I didn’t get a response in order to work on a new feature.  But the response seems to be a bit of work, so it is not quite appropriate. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!

UPDATE
As mentioned below, I ended up just using this, and replacing ticket by bus. This seems a little bit more natural since it seems as if my intent is to ask what the customer thinks about the service. I have also added some words (such as: any issues?) in an attempt to cover all potentials. Still not sure which one I should use though. And I will probably have another update in one or two weeks. So far it has been a success. :)

Thank you for your help and time. (Sorry about my lack of English, not my native language).
To your points:
If you look at it, ""work"" could mean many things: working on the software, work that is part of my work (for example, writing this ticket), a request that has to do with work. The latter is excluded from the first two, while the question could fit all of them. ""Work"" is a very generic word and could be used for multiple scenarios. It is just that it might sound odd to people who are not used to English. In any case, what would sound weird to them could sound fine to me. For example a doctor saying: ""I did some work today,"" or a professor in his office. Of course, there is nothing wrong with using the word ""tour"", however this would seem much more common for people in tourism, who"

After @Takashi's answer, I changed my intent-filters to the one he said and the problem was that, after removing some parts of my app, the app kept the old intent filters in its manifest.

What is your opinion of the quality of this utterances? Are they well formed?

A:
**I think **""pay to"" is not the same as pay**today**. You have two ways to say ""pay today"", but ""payment to"", ""to pay"", and ""receipt of payment"", are not all the exact meaning, because you can't ""purchase"" or ""get/get a receipt of purchase"", so you may need more context here. 
If it's in your context like in this example, you are paying for something today, then ""do I need a replacement card"" depends on how the card is working, it depends if the payment process works or not (like, is it ""not working"", the chip on the credit card might be not working or it has some problem to communicate with the POS device).
Also, ""contactless"" usually implies ""tap and go"", which is a bit specific to the specific store (in my country, we use NFC only for one bank, and not for all stores)."

We're looking for an intent that expresses that the user wanted to use the payment method but was turned down. In this particular case the turn down may have been due to a technical issue, but the fact that it occurred would mean that there exists at least one possible explanation for what happened.

@Clemens The intent you're describing is an action, not an interaction. A more suitable intent for this type of example would be a command that has a result which is to turn off the interaction:
Turn off interaction
The system is not processing that payment. It would appear that
there has been a problem. Can you try again? <button>
I can't turn it off. <command> Turn it on</command>. <turn-on>...</turnon>[citation needed]
Thanks!
From the list of intent patterns provided (see the link in the above question), there are some that can be used to describe this interaction, however I'm unsure which would most accurately be the closest match for the context provided. I would lean towards the action patterns: Turn off, Turn on, turn-off as they are closest. However, as it's a little ambiguous which one of those was actually the cause of the result given, I'd prefer something a bit more clear, especially as the system did work for a different user. Would it be possible to have one or more of these: turn on (if it turns on), turnoff (only if it does turnon first? ), turn(down) (to indicate that something has gone wrong in addition to just turning off?) and turn (down to indicate just that)?
If there were a specific intent name for such a situation that's close to this one I think that would help a great deal but I can see this being very open to interpretation. The ""accept"" command pattern may be relevant if this happened on the account screen, so that a ""turn on"" would take place but an error code could be sent with the ""off"".
In general it may just be worth considering the idea that any one interaction in any service can have more than one result"

A:
– This is a pretty broad question, but it's worth some consideration. The intent should be Contactless is not working, as in the device is failing to provide a contact-less response. 
The intent ""contactless"" doesn't really map to a single meaning, since it is actually an enumeration of a subset of the possible values for the ContactType property of NFC data, and it can change in future versions of Windows (and, in theory).
So the answer to your question depends on the context. If the question is about the current state of Microsoft's NFC development, I would say ""working"", but I can't say more.
If we consider ""broken"" to be ""The device doesn’t work in this manner"", and ""not working"" is ""There is no response at this location"", then the only relevant value here is working and the others are the result of an unexpected change or error."

examples of ""pay tomorrow"" are ""Pay Tomorrow"", ""Make This Tomorrow's Bill Payment"", and ""Check Bill"".
If you're asking about this particular context, you can simply say: ""I'd like to make this tomorrow's bus payment"", because this will match all these 3 intent and also the context ""why wouldnt..."" can have multiple intent
In other words, for ""intent matching"" of this kind, it's always best to stick to the simple sentence pattern. In this case, your sentence is simply not good enough to cover all the different possibilities...
You can also go for the ""What can you do with a cardless bus station?"" approach, where there are no specific intent to match:
(1) pay in the future
Pay in 2 hours
pay in 5 minutes (it is in 10 minutes to go!)
payment on this bus? (I just realized this is probably the most common use case. It could also be the case I'm trying to ask about. Sorry for not considering it earlier.)
And so forth. These are all valid and they should all do the same thing. The only real difference in meaning is: when you ask ""Why wouldn’t it?"" you are probably looking to see if there‘s a good reason for that behavior to begin with, whereas if you look at (1)-(5) you may not have thought about the possible reasons until you find that there is. But the intent in (3), as far as I can tell, is exactly the opposite of the others. So I think the right answer for this question is to use (4).
However, I“m not at all convinced I understand what you meant with your comment about “contextualization”. Do you mean that contextualization is a valid argument in some cases when an ambiguous sentence isn't sufficient to answer a specific question? I agree there can be cases where it makes sense.

What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: work?, do?, help?. The following intent are not applicable (no action or value) as they do not have explicit values and no explicit value.

The intent should be able to handle the case with one or more of the followings (which are optional attributes):
- Location (latitude and longitude)
For the cases where latitude and or longtitude is missing. If missing, intent will consider all locations in the given search radius.
When using the intent do/work, the action will always be ""work""
Do/help will return either ""do"" or ""help"", and the actions for ""Do"" will be different depending on which do type was picked by the user. When a user says ""I do"" they will get either Do/Help.When a User says they did something, they should either get ""Did/helped"", or get a list of items to complete or work on. In this case I will use list/complete list. (See the example here for more details. http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/speech/example/get-user-list/).
This way the app can return a more natural response. For example

I have a number of cases that can be considered similar. I will give an example.
A contact-less card is a card that does not need a physical connector on the computer. There is also a contact less card which does require a special device to operate. Both cards are similar in many ways. One difference is that a fixed card will have all its settings set to default, while the contact free card might have some settings changed. A user might want to change the settings on a non-default card. For instance, maybe they want a new pin code on their card, or they have updated it to a newer model. In these cases, one would want set the setting for the user-defined card on. However, I don't know how I want the intent. Is it a simple fix intent (set the card's settings) or a ""change the default settings"" intent? I also could be asked to set a default-card or an update-my-fixed-cards. The contact is on an intent level, is it the same as an action of setContactlessState? Is the context of the action to be set, for example the phone, the car, a terminal... Or is is to always be a fix contact/contactfree. And I could imagine that the set state could have more than one fix action. If the fix is set on ""my fixed cards"" and I am in my car and need to update it, should the update have it set as ""defaults"", or something with a more accurate description. 
To make it even more complex there is another case that happens a bit more often. Someone might ask for a set default for all cards, which would make all the cards in the terminal default to the state set by the server. Or, someone might be asking for something different, e.g. set some other card as the primary, and set all other cards as secondary. These questions might come from the system and/or the end user. Also they might just be in a hurry or the situation does seem a lot faster then if it is not fixed right away. That said, it would be quite useful to have an automated way to do this instead of me having to think through all these different cases. Which brings up a second question: is there an"

Is there a resource out there that I'm missing? 
Update for @user13182733, @SebastianoBattisti and @Cristian:
There seems to be no clear consensus. For example, the official Android support page says
To find out if the contact is recognized, you can use: Intent.ACTION_PASSPORT_READER_FACTORY
For any intent that is sent on an Android device you will be able to see if it corresponds to one of the
intent-filter patterns. The most likely one would be: “android.intent.action.PERSONAL_COMMUNICATION”
That doesn´t tell us very much, in my opinion. Maybe someone else knows the answer
My guess is that it refers to ""P-C-R"" or the ""personal communication"" of my card. This does not mean that the app will accept the request, or that Android is accepting. I have no way to test that. However, based on the other answers (thanks @Mauricio Castro and his answer), I think it means the phone is asking the user to accept a payment of a specific amount.

How do you get the contact to function?
You need to make an arrangement with the credit card companies, to be ready to accept contact. (You might want to set your own credit limit to ensure you can handle all those transactions)
In other words, you need credit cards. You may have one already, for a certain amount of credit, or, depending on your agreement with your credit company, be issued a creditcard
So, your task is to either make your computer function as a payment device
or,
to get creditcards from somewhere. For the latter, ask your local credit office, and they will help you apply for your cards, at a discount. The amount you'll be charged is, usually, based on the total amount that you plan to spend with them, so you are, in some sense, paying for the use of your card.

Is there a more natural way to express this? If so, how? I am not looking for grammatical advice, just how to convey this more clearly.

How can we get a replacement/replacement card on a specific minimum? This is what prompted me to add this to my original question. I know how this can't work but would like to know what it would look like. For example (please note the '?' and '!')
A? is for what could work: If I add a line to an existing account, what's it called? What does that cost? And the? could refer to a question such as: Could I do that? Can I get that card and remove that line? Or is that not what we're talking about? Would be grateful for any feedback. Thank you!

I have seen this question asked in various contexts, but the answers I found don't really help me.
What is it about a contact-less payment that does not work?
Is it not possible to do so? 
The answers to this questions seem to imply (or even suggest) that ""it is not in the cards, sorry"".
So why don’t the payment processors provide an API, to enable me to programmatically query if it is, in fact, working (i.e. if ""Contactless"" is listed in a list of supported methods). For example:
https://www.paypal.com/uk/cgi-bin/marketingweb?cmd=_paymentDetails-heading&method=contactless_details&product_number=PLCO%2F5%3A1222
There are no error or other messages, it simply says ""Method not supported"". I know they do support it, because I use paypal express. However, for whatever reason there is no way of testing that this method is working.   If it doesn‘t work, there doesn't seem much I can do about it (aside from contacting pay pal customer services).
Am I missing something here? Is there perhaps a ""contact-us"" type of form that can be used to test the contact method? Or is there really no other way to check, as the method name does seem like it should say something? Perhaps the developers of the SDKs (like Paypal or Braintree) don´t have a clue what they are doing, and the only way a user can actually check if their contact is supported is by testing the other method (which will be listed as not_supported)?
If someone could tell me what I am missing here, or why they feel the way they did, that would be awesome. Otherwise, I will have to contact customer support, which in my opinion is an option that should not exist. I do have the choice not to use contact support if I want to, no matter how poor it may be. If the system simply does work with contact, then that option should be there. It makes no sense to say that I cannot even test if a system works with one method, when I have other methods to choose from. (The only reason I"

In this case what you want is ""want"", which, as a verb, takes no other arguments. So the answer depends entirely on your context.
If you were trying to make the sentence sound more polite, you could say:

A:
“contactless” is a term for NFC technology. There is no “intent’, per se, but ‘do‘, ’am„ and „am able‟ will suffice here, since ” am‭ is already used in the standard to describe a general capability.
If the device has NFC support it will be able (depending on the type of NFC tag it can read) to read the tag. The device should then decide what to respond."

UPDATE: I'm looking for the answer from a technical perspective
In other words, I just need to know the technical implementation of the above scenario. 
I don't need an analysis of business requirements, or what is a good approach to this problem domain. I can get that elsewhere. It's just the implementation details. So far I have found 3 links but they are very specific to a specific NFC implementation by a company who has a lot of other things going on so it's not what I am looking to do. The 3 I currently have are as follows:
https://github.com/takip/libnfc
http://docs.lib.pwc.pl/PWCSDK/en-US/ch12-nfccontactlesspayments.pdf
Android NFC API
The first one doesn't even have anything about contact-less transactions but it looks promising
Any help is really welcome
Thank-you. :)
EDIT2:  I should clarify that I understand the business side of what happens during contact and contact pay transactions, but the question I posted doesn’t have enough information to be helpful on that end. If I want to ask how the NFC chips work on these mobile phones, that's fine but that would be off topic. That was never the intent of this question. Thank You for catching that. Sorry for not clarifying this earlier. :(
P.S. if this is not the place to post such a question, can someone please advise where I would have better luck? Thank-You. :D
Edit3: If it helps, here is what i am attempting to accomplish: https://developer.android.google.cn/guide/pay/android/nfd-how-it-works.html
So, with these new updates in mind, the questions are: is Android NFC capable of performing all the things I asked about in my question? and If so, then: Where might I find information about this?   :P

My first thought is that the former could be used with any contact form of an electric tool, whereas the latter would be restricted to contact forms such as a screwdriver.  I would think the later would also be more likely to be understood as 'which is not working', given the context. I'd be interested in hearing from the community about which they think is best. Are there other differences I'm not aware of?

A:
Chapter 3.2.3.4 of the Intents and Slots book has more about it: 
(emphasis in the answer is mine)
If you have an object for which several different slots may be applicable, the
best slot for an intent should be the one for the type of object being acted on. For
example, in
1. help <contact> (i.e. a contact slot of a cell phone),
2.<contact <object>> <slot>,
3.<object <type> > <location>, and
4.<type <class>,location>
the slots of type <category> of <place> take precedence over the slots <number> and <quantity>, so the slot with
highest precedence should determine an <intent>.

What is 'use' in the above statement? Is it a command to use the pay as contactfree pay method or is it something similar to the 'go' verb that means 'it's time'.
Thank you.
Answer
I guess that the answer is: it is an intent and it doesn’t make any sense. If we try to apply a semantic analyser, we get the expected results:
Intent: Use as command
Argument: contact-free payment
Action: perform contact free pay
Object: payment_method
As you can see, what we are doing is performing a contact_free_pay command, but it cannot be used as an object. So we cannot use it as the object of other verbs like pay, so that it should mean pay in contact with a person. This is a common mistake. There are many sentences similar in English that are very weird due to lack of semantics. For example, take the example “I eat”, this sentence means you‘re putting on your mouth the food (what we call an action) and you are not taking anything out (the object is empty). We could easily change it to ‘I don‟t eat anymore„ (this is very similar but not the same).
Another common example is „What you want?“, which you could also rephrase as ”What do you prefer? I‚m asking you to specify what you like more‬ (as a question), and this should be translated to a set of instructions and not to an ask-intent. Another example of such a sentence that also has no semantics is ""Who is that?"" or ""Where is she coming from?"". These are just examples of sentences that lack semantics in order to be clear. These sentences are confusing. We should never translate them in this way. It›s like if you were translating from Russian: ‚Тогда это изменяется.‛, it means that after that change, that sentence will be different, because the meaning is changing, the semantics are changing. The translation you made is not"

What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","accept incoming transfers to transfer them elsewhere? transfer incoming transactions to the sender? (I'd suggest the first two are equivalent, but maybe the last one is what you meant by 'accept transfer')
Given some sort of data store that supports some kind of messaging protocol, you probably want to be able to do the transfer operation, which probably means you need to construct a message and send it.
The message should be serialized in some way, possibly encoded with some scheme you choose. You can also just serialize in an arbitrary way. For instance, maybe you can serialise a hash code, some unique identifier in addition to a transaction description, or, even worse, just put it straight into JSON. I would avoid this latter option. The key idea of the protocol is being able by some other piece of software to deserialize the JSON into an object. 
I would consider the most straightforward approach is for the client app to make a request to your app. Your app may accept this request, construct the serialised message (in any format you'd like), and make use of any message delivery protocol to push this message out to other parts of your code. In addition, your server app could listen for incoming messages, deseralize a response and return it to any app that needs to receive it (such as the original caller)
There are lots of details you could consider. But, fundamentally, this is just a question about message passing between pieces of program code in a networked situation. This is exactly what the internet is based around."

For the above, a classifier is trained using the labeled examples of the set (i.e., the dataset). After training, given a new example, the trained classifiers predict the intent of that example. The predicted intention is then compared against the label. This is called a naive Bayesian class (NBC), and is a popular approach to NLU.
  The NBC approach is intuitive because of its ease-of-use, however its performance is quite low due to its simplicity. 
NBC is also computationally very easy but its accuracy is extremely low. For this reason an attempt to improve accuracy has involved adding an extra layer of classifying to the NBC algorithm (such as a support Vector Machine class, or SVN). Although this approach leads to an improved accuracy, it does not lead to much improvement in terms of computational power
A more advanced approach (based on the Bayes theorem) is known as the Maximum A Posteriori Classifier (MPC). This approach requires that a probability distribution of possible class labels is defined. Once a model of this probability is constructed, then inference is performed by calculating the probability of each class label given the examples. An estimate of probability for each of these class estimates is found in one of two ways; either by a sampling procedure or by the application of Bayesean theorem. These class probability estimates are then used to decide what class is more likely based on these samples. One key advantage of a MPC model is that it requires less training data than a NBC model. While the computational expense of both approaches is roughly the same, this is not the case when it comes to memory requirements; a simple MPc requires much less memory due because it makes few predictions at once. MPCs also tend to outperform SVNs and other classifications for some problems, such as when an intent is very ambiguous. A good example of where the MPcs performs relatively better than the SVMs is in sentiment analysis or the detection of fraud in credit cards. Finally, SVMS (in their most complex form) are more complex than MPCS, and can be very hard to train. However, there do exist tools that are able to automate the training of SVNS."

Kenny KFeb 19 '11 at 20:41
I guess it is very dependent on the language. Some languages use the 'intents' to decide what kind of utterances they need the system to handle (e.g. some chat systems can have intents for different kinds of greetings). I don't know the structure for the chatbots, so the answer depends on what the authors intended.
In the case of chatbot, I guess you are just interested what would be the easiest way to implement a solution that would handle all the possible intant. For example, it would help you to create a simple parser that recognizes the intants and then you have to map these intances to a response. It would give you a chance to experiment with various techniques like NLU, Dialog Act Analysis, etc. I think the simplest method would the Naive Bayes or something like it. The Naïve Bayse works by training your system based on previous utterations and the expected intent. Then it uses the training data to classify other utternces. In your case I would classify all utterts into the same category. But it also depends of how the bot will work in the application. If it will be a chat bot, then it may work as a conversation and you may need to train the user. How do you plan to do it? You may want to use NLG as well. There should be libraries to help. You don;t have some idea? Sorry. Maybe I can help or find it for you. Good Luck."

No one is going to read the tag and act on the information in it. (The intent here is to determine the 'best-fitting tag' or to find the correct 'tag to ask' questions.) There is a community consensus that 'transfers' is meant to apply to the entire subject, which means that the community has a shared understanding as to what's meant.

For the purposes of this post, let’s assume that the above utterances refer to the act of sending money to your bank, in the form of a transfer request.
What I‘d like is to be told (as concisely as possible) the most probable intent of the user of an application. It should be as unambiguous as: “The user intended to make a money transfer, and we know that that”. I can then use this information to improve the UI, the documentation, etc …
I know there‚Äôs intent-detection (and even ontologies). What I would rather know is: what are the typical actions that users would perform on the specific domain (in this case: money transfers) with the system (swift)?

EDIT (June 2017):
Since I first posted this question (I think the answer is still the same), we“ve seen Swift become a more and more important system to send and receive money. This is good, because it gives us a lot of insights. And it„s even better because we were able to develop and integrate the Swift ontology into the iOS SDK. But the problem is that there are only a handful of people that actually know what a Swift transaction is. So what happens when you try to write this in a documentation?

Edit 1: It occurs to me that I'm not sure that 'transfer' means'move a number from one account to the other' (I'm thinking of'moving from' rather than 'to') but I've left it as 'account'.
The following is an example of my interpretation:
'If I have the account number to top up and the amount to charge, will I be able to make a topping over to John's number?'
If you mean 'will I pay the same amount as if I topped this up myself', that will be a different question, because 'paying' can be interpreted as the money changing hands. This would require the person to have sufficient money to cover both the top-ups and then the bill. That person would also need to know what John is entitled to, i.e. the cost of John‘s call time, so the caller does not have an overpayment. If the intended meaning is 'pay the mobile operator's invoice', we would need an agreement to what this means, e.g. what are all the options and if the customer has any choice, what it means. I don’t think any mobile operators have a service where they agree to do this for another customer. However, it does seem that mobile telephone bill top ups in the US are often performed by the service provider‚ for example, Sprint. Therefore, this might also be an appropriate answer to your questions (or one of them - I m not clear on the details).
As regards the phrase ‚transfer‛, I think you‟d need more context. 'Transferring money from A"

For the sake of example let's use an Intent called getTransfer, and we assume that we already have a request which returns a single object, let that be:
   { ""object_name_1"": ""value_of_object1""
}
And we will assume further that the object name is a string, the value is an object that can have properties, as well as having a ""string-like"" property that will match the query in the intent.
If we want to add a get-transfer to that intent then we could do: 
{
""intent"": {
 ""name"": getTransfert,
},
....
, ""data"": {""name"":""getTransfer"", ""body"":""value for the gettransfer""}
.....
. ""request"":{} //optional
 }
However, a problem arises when the data in ""GET transfer"" is in JSON format, which it probably usually is. I want the ability to parse it, since it needs to be done in Python. The data is not the request object. It is just data that I get back from the server. However, it could be a file containing the name of the file which I can get from request.request.file and then I am able to read the JSON response using json.load().
Now, I do want a parser which can be used to extract values from a JSON document. My question is what would the ""best matching"" intent be, given it must match one of these below in some way: {""data"":{""name""}=""value""}? I don't want my code to check all possible Intent combinations, even to have to do a bunch of if (data.has_key(name) && data.get(NAME) == value).
So, what Intent should be given a json string to a GET transfer intent?  Is there a pattern that could help me find all matching ones? Would you recommend that in my case I should just use a different method to retrieve the information? Or would you have an intent that would match both scenarios?

In the early 1970s, researchers at Stanford began to experiment with a new type of computer, and the first commercial products were actually designed at the University of Utah. This led to the growth of companies such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Apple, Texas Instruments, Xerox, Digital Equipment Corp., and many other large firms, whose products are still sold to this day. In the late 1980s and early 1990s these firms began the widespread production of personal computers (PCs), which were originally designed for businesses and educational institutions. These were not only small, but also cheap, with prices sometimes as low as \$100, which brought them into the hands of large numbers of buyers, including households, who started using them in increasing amounts, as they could be obtained in large quantities as a result of falling prices, making the ownership cost less for many people. With the spread of the Internet, the use of computers in households also grew rapidly. Currently, a significant portion of households all over the world use such machines on a daily basis, although the penetration rates differ strongly from country to country. For instance, in the United States, more than 90% of adults use a computer for everyday purposes, whereas in Brazil, this figure is closer to 10%.
The development of computing technology began with the vacuum tube, first demonstrated in 1906. It consisted of several glass vacuum tubes sealed to each other, all with pins on their sides. When current was sent through the pins, they created an electric field that made the cathodes emit electrons, while the ""anodes"" attracted the emitted electrons. A vacuum in between the anode and cathode ensured that the electrons travelled only a short distance, so they were accelerated, or focused, towards the nearest electrode. By connecting the electrode to a ""collector"" or ""grid"", an alternating electric current could control the flow of electrons through a device from vacuum to atmosphere. Early computers operated on this principle, using a series of interconnected"

What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","deal transfer deals? transfer transfers transfers deals dealing transfer deal dealing swift transfer? deals swift transferring will deal deals with transfers swift will? dealing deal will swift a transfer dealing deals will it deal swift deals deal deal a swift deal?

The answers to the above question is ""No"" as it is clear that a direct answer to this question has not been conveyed through the sentences.
This sentence contains at least four different kinds of anaphors: subject (deal), object (transfers), predicate (swift) and prepositional phrase, each of which can be interpreted from different points of view to answer this particular question. For instance, swift- dealing is a subject an object preposition phrase (and not an an adjective like deals or a determiner like dealing), and swift dealing implies two different subjects, one the verb dealing and the other the preposing prenominal, and thus, we get the answer of ""no"", because swift is not a pronoun. 
Swift deal transferring could also be an answer, because we can read swift and deal as the subject and transfers, respectively, in the sentence dealing transfers. But, Swift transfer and dealing both cannot be a single subject, so, this answer is ruled out too. We can also choose between swift to deal and deals to transfer; the former gives us swift swift, the latter gives the word swift with a noun to go with it. If we choose swift (as is more likely) then swift Swift deals would be the only answer. Here both swift has been marked as an attribute to swift: Swift Deal would make the most sense, giving a sentence of swift Deal, but we would not say swift of the deal, since swift does not have a pre-nomial. Swift Swift dealing would also seem like a strange sentence to say. To deal to Swift and Swift to Deal are both grammatically and semantically correct. (As an aside, I think swift can only be used as a prefix to nouns, as in swift river, not as part of a compound verb or gerund).
If we take swift in its meaning as swiftness (which is also very common), swift as fast as possible, then Swift Deals are not possible. The reason is that we cannot move a word like transfers to another part as we have not provided the context. This is similar to our problem with the"

@djb: I don’t want to seem like I‘m complaining about this, but this kind of question is actually a little bit of the “why doesn”t the software do it?“ kind. The best question to ask in this situation is, ” why not? or why do I need this? If you find an answer to your question in some source code or documentation, that‟s the right answer. If not, then the only way you‰۪ll know is if you experiment a bit, or try out your own code. In both cases, be sure to post about it here. You‚Äôll find out if there‭ìs a good reason for not allowing this. That„s more valuable than you might think.‬

A:
The word ""top-up"" is rarely heard, and is mostly used by the companies providing a mobile phone top up facility. 
You are asking this question in a sense that a person might be looking for a top level company, for example a phone operator, who would provide the ""best"" top (i.e. the highest) fees. And, there is no such company.
I would expect the closest you can get on a general level is a bank, which will charge for each transaction, typically on the basis of the average size of a transaction (how many units do you want to top your account up?) and the total value of money top'd up (amount of top). For top, they will also be based on their own internal policies and their costs (and profit margin of course).
If you need further assistance, I would recommend you ask a question on our sister website English Language & Usage, as the answers are very likely to be more precise."

The intent to charge to the buyer or seller's account is ambiguous. Topping up implies one of two things.
To charge the account of the other party, which would normally be a bank account. I assume this is covered by the charge intent. 
A topping-up charge in the case that this would be allowed and that the bank could charge this amount. There are banks that can charge topping ups, but not everyone can use them, and not every country/region has this feature (at least not yet). Therefore, I don't see this as an intent that could be unambiguously identified. If your intent is to have this covered explicitly, then this intent could not be identified unambly and would need to be reworded as: charge/top-ups to account (or something like that)."

The charge for ""any monetary"" amount is not a charge, but receiving any amount of money is, so that charge doesn't apply.
It's easy to see this from this example, because there is nothing to receive money in the charge clause, while receiving is required. This means that there's nothing for the clause to qualify, which means it can be dropped entirely."

I do not consider the above utterances to be felonies or even misdemeanours. 
Why, despite this difference?  Is the difference between the three a matter of intent?
This would not be an easy question to answer without a legal background. For that background, I can only offer a layman's opinion based on the information available to me (including common sense).
In my view:   To receive something is to obtain a benefit. To pay a fee is different (although receiving money is in essence a kind of payment).  This difference is more pronounced for money. The first two examples seem to indicate an intention to acquire a certain thing - a ""fee"". It seems to have nothing to do with being paid, or being in a position to pay, but I may be wrong. Perhaps someone with a more legal knowledge can help me understand why. If there are no differences to these facts, the most felicitous explanation I could find is that the question I ask is meaningless. In that case I'd be grateful for any explanation. :)
EDIT
To be clear: I'm looking for a definition or explanation of the word ""to pay"" or for an explanation why the intent is irrelevant. There are many ways one can pay something - in the sense that they can transfer (some, more or less) of their money to the holder of something they want in return. One could be paying the electricity bill, for instance. A fee, in this sense, is just a way of paying, so ""fees"" could simply be renamed ""payments"" and we'd not have to ask any further questions about them."

(I'm trying to teach myself about the different sentence patterns that are found in Spanish. The above example has been taken from The Free Grammar of Spanish by Michael Swan. I'm using the book as a reference.)
Update: I think a better version of the question to ask is, ""What is wrong with this Spanish translation of ""How much is it to transfer the funds?"":
-How seperate is money transfered sepparately?   (or) how sepperately is each transfere money?
This is because the second sentence is gramatically not possible. It would mean to transfem money into different accounts which is not what you're trying do. In fact, you need an auxiliary verb in this type of sentence. However, it would be a grammatically correct use of a conjunction in a similar situation, like: ""how much does it cost to buy a ticket?"", ""I was charged how is my money?"" but not here. Also it does not make sense as you can only transfer money to a person's account. So the first example is more appropriate for the original question."

The intent charge has an ambiguous antecedent, which is not explicitly given in the sentence. Is it the first or second one? Can we infer the antecendent of the question from the context?

If yes, how? How could we tell that it is charge? What does charge have to do with anything that is transferred? Or is it a reference to charge in general? If it's the second case, can we say with certainty that a separator has charge by context or inference? We'd need to check how many times separators are used to figure out which of those cases is this sentence referring to.
This sentence is a little more subtle, as it seems to imply that there is no actual charge at all. How exactly would it be phrased to avoid that meaning? Like: charge of transfer or transfer of charge or no transfer at  charge. I'll leave it to you as an exercise to come up with your own answer on this one. 
Edit: Here's an attempt at what I think is your meaning, using the word charge as the noun in each case:  transfer-of-(charge) transfer-(of)-charge transfer. In each one of these cases, the transfer has a charge, and the charge can be passed from one transfer to the other. For the last case we can't be sure that the sentences refer to transfers and charges; we know that they are talking about the same thing, charge transfers, but we're missing the part in that sentence that defines that thing. You might think this means there's no way to know what you're talking of, unless the thing you are referring is explicitly defined in another place. That's not so. The sentence implies that charge is some type of entity. If we go to a dictionary, we find this:
def charge; plural charges

This would be an example of negation. The negated subject of 'i' will be'me', the subject, of the verb phrase'should' is 'the'. Thus, we get the sentence ""should I be"" which makes little grammatical sense.
However, this sentence also indicates that ""I"" is in fact a singular subject. 
As such we have to make two different interpretations of what is said by the speaker:
If we assume that 'I', i.e. ""me"" in this case, is a plural subject and the negator, 'not', is also a grammatic subject as well, then we would say: ""Not I"" (in this particular case ""you"") should ""be"", which can lead, via the chain of inferences: Topping transfer (the sentence I was given), topping the transferal."

This is a follow-up to What's the difference between ""tell you about"" and ""let me explain to you"", but a bit more specific, with more concrete examples. The main issue here is: I'm not asking for the meaning of the verb ""to tell"". If I had an English dictionary, I'd look up ""swift"" in it, and see what the noun ""transfer"" (swifter, swift) means. But I don't have an dictionary. I have a few books on grammar, but they don' talk about how to distinguish between these two very similar verbs - ""please tell"" vs. ""I'd like to explain"" - without using an example that shows what to think about. So I was curious to know, does some sort general ""rule of thumb"" exist to be able to tell these examples apart? It seems to me that some verbs in English are very closely related and are used interchangeably, like ""ask"" with ""inquire"". Others seem like it's impossible to use them as a verb or as part of an utterances. In French, ""conversation"" often refers to something which is spoken, as in ""we are having a conversation"". ""Telling"" is something I've read about a lot, for example here: http://forum.wordreference.com/threads/tell.274514/#post-1249095 and here http:/en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Tell
So my idea is to write down some examples and then see how I can use these to figure out if they are telling or asking. Here's an excerpt from one of my books:
Tell, ask, request, question or request an explanation. All of these can be distinguished from each other according to the type of request. Tell is used to say something. Ask is usually used for request for explanation or information. Request an answer can indicate that a question has already been put by the person asking, in which case the other person answers the query or requests information from the first person. For example, John asks Mary how she knows him. Mary answers, ‘Because John told me.’ The verb �"

comment I think the real question is, how to avoid the ambiguity ""I was charged to receive the transfer""
The other alternative, to use a word other than'receiving', may avoid some ambiguity. The most straightforward way - and my preference - is probably to just say ""a fee will be required if I receive"", though you would usually omit the definite article here, unless you wanted to draw attention to the particular fee being mentioned. ""A fee is required when I transfer to SEPA"" (but ""when"" should be ""if I"", even though ""to SEP"" is not technically a verb here...) is a bit awkward, though, I suppose. You might be able to make this work, by using a more specific subject than just ""me"" -- for example, ""the customer is entitled to a full refund when he does transfer"". (You might even be allowed to add a clause here: ""If I use SEpa to..."")
You can also use 'to transfer' instead, as an alternative to 'transfer to' or 'I transfer'. If you use these, you need to remember that the subject is singular: eg ""When I (I as a person) transfer I need a receipt"" or ""For the customer, transfer means (to be received) a refund"". 'To' can never be a preposition here; eg, never ""*I received the payment to (be transferred) to you"" (""I transferred payment from you to me"" would be fine), only ""The payment will (transfer) from me (the person who pays) when it arrives"". If there is no 'when' then '*to' will usually be replaced by 'by', eg: If I 'am' (as a payment agent) 'transferred"
315,when topping up by transfer will i be charged?,['charged transfer'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","I’ve also seen a similar form of the verb used with the ‘will the charge be?‘ preposition, like so: “What is my next stop”, is it more appropriate to use charged stop?

A:
The two prepositions are used quite differently and their uses aren t even very closely related.
It seems clear that ’topping up​ by‌ transfer is more likely to involve an ATM than a petrol pump, and thus is also more commonly used to refer to the former. But it is very common to ask for the next available bus stop or train station, where the transfer of money is likely. If you are asking about your next hotel room, or next meeting room at work, topping it up is a far more sensible question. That is because you aren t asking for money, you aren't charging, but just transferring, so the use of charging is nonsensical. In addition, the usage with 'transfer' implies a much smaller amount, whereas the common usage of'stop' (a word of a slightly wider usage) tends to imply a bigger amount. As you have seen in your examples, in all such cases, asking the question in the negative is perfectly legitimate."
316,what us the fee to transfer money from my bank?,"['transfer money', 'transfer bank']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","The problem is, the ""transfer"" part of the question is a bit of a misnomer and the answer is not so cut-and-dry as just ""a fee"". For example, in the UK, when you transfer a bank from one institution to another, both institutions usually ""agree"" to a fee. However, this does not apply to all transfers - if you use a debit card from a major bank, you will not be charged any fees (unless this is specified). I don't think this answers the intent of OP's question, but I do hope it provides a starting point for discussion.

317,do i get charged if i am getting money?,"['getting money', 'getting money']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","Getting charge-up?

A:
The closest one to your question is ""get charge"".
If you said that: get-charge will take in a charge of money, which you will give to someone.
In this case, it means ""You will get to charge something"", which means that someone will charge you. However, you need to know, this does not necessarily mean that you are getting charged yourself, but someone is charging you for something (as in: ""I will not charge $X.00 for this"").
Also, in general, the word charge can also be used for physical electricity (which is what you would mean in your sentence).
This would be similar to saying that I will be charging something, and you charge your phone. But, I can't think of a more similar example to the one you give."

1) tell is a verb of telling in the sense of ""telling""
2) the cost is an object of (cost)
3) Total cost could be an ""attributive phrase"" that is ""about cost"" and is related to the verb tell. 
Question: Am my interpretations right?   And could you please provide some further clarifications for what exactly are the three interpretations that I have given. Are there other interpretations possible? I would appreciate if some of you can help me a little bit in understanding this problem.
Thank you. (I have read through quite a lot of similar posts but did not get the answer to my question.)
Edit: I'm sorry, I should have said that in my original question I asked about a sentence that looks like below. This sentence is taken from a paper, and I want to analyze the part that says can, tell and cost. I am sorry for the mis-use of can in this question. Thanks. :)  (the question in bold is what I meant.):  ""A can B, but B will never can A. A can tell B but I believe B cannot tell A."", or, ""B can cost, because A cannot cost B."" I think B is B as a person, or as an entity. So this means that B can give A something if A gives B something, B could cost A, since A could always cost someone. But if B doesn't cost anything then of course it can't be costed. If B costs A then A does not cost something (B). And as you said in your answer about ""total cost can be interpreted as cost plus a modifier that expresses a quality or property of A that makes it a cost to A"" then yes, you are correct in that a part of my sentence could mean that the ""modifier"" is cost instead of price. Sorry!
And, by the way, what would you think about this phrase: ""I believe that they don't have a can"" instead, which does mean the same. Is it possible to think that one doesnot have something in such a way? Can it be a grammatical use"

You can use any of this. They can be used in an interrogative sense or a declarative manner. The question is about the meaning of that utterances.

Reasoning over the answers, I think the most correct and complete answer, in the context of your question, is: the top of the money to spend, not the total money in bank.
As the question is asked in an answer: if you have money left in money, you can spend it, top or not. If you don't, can't you? And if so, it makes no difference on how much your spending, what's more important is to have some or any. And as you say you are already at the highest level of spending. So, no matter how you top it up, your are going to be at that level anyway, so why not? The limit is not how many coins you spent, but how little you still have to go. You can easily spend the last coin, and you'll be there, because you're already there. The question should be: What would be the least I can top, before I am at my limit, i.e. what am I left with? That's also an important question. But that would not fit this question's answer. :)
I think that, when the OP asks about ""top-limit"" (and the other forms ""to-top"" or ""no-topping""), it means the maximum money you plan to spent in that transaction. (Or, more specifically, the ""extra"" money after that is spent. This is what I'm guessing, of course.)
Anyway, my answer is that your bank, as an institution, does not know where you stand in regards to your limit. It only knows that you will not spend any more until you reach your balance. In that sense I agree that it is irrelevant if someone spends more than that. That would imply they are at or close to their limit and it doesn't matter whether some more money comes in or how the current balance will change. On the contrary, there might be a lot of money coming. I could also top that up and have a limit of -50 coins. Then, someone can just spend more and I'd still be safe."

A:
""limit the amount of money on the account""
The intent ""limit"" is not a sub-intent of ""topups"".  It does not make sense to speak of a limit as a top up.
Also note that if the first word of your uttertion is really 'limit', the meaning of 'top ups' could be different.  For example, in 
'I am going to limit myself to two topupps a day' the word 'to' can mean ""until"" or ""on"".
In the context of the question, ""the"" top upps"" means ""I want two of those top upts.""
If your original utterment was  'I limit top' (or ""it limit to top"" etc), I would have said this doesn't make a lot of sense, but it is a grammatical utteration."

What are some things to consider in designing the study? What would be some important considerations for choosing which of those things, or none of them are most important?
The first thing to decide on is what to use as an identifier for your study. As I noted in the last post, a lot of people are going to say, “I’m going use your identifier as the name of your data element.”
That‘s not a great idea, because names are often ambiguous for the same data. For example, your first data collection is about people“s height‹and I want to know how many women there are› and how tall was the tallest woman‒and so now you can‑t really look at all the height data and make sense of it‖. So, it has to be a unique identifier to begin with if you want it to retain its value. The same is true for dates. A person‛s birthday‰or a car‚s make and model‌can become a person/car‐ID. If your research design has a data analysis that depends on the unique values of an ID, then use something that is already unique to start with . Otherwise, don t choose an un-unique identifier. It is much better to choose a name for each data, so you don ‚ t have to look back when you look for it later. Then, use the identifier name in your code‬ .

ANSWER: (thank you!):
The idea is to have a shared bot object that would be able to understand the top up limits of an account without knowing its identity. For that, the main bot should have some reference to a 'topup.dat' file. It should read this file whenever the user wants the limits and have this information passed from the ""parent"" bot"

P.S. This is my first Stack Exchange post, so be gentle with me :)
Update
To get more precise, it is clear from the examples that there are at least 3 top/up combinations (top ups; top ones; and tops).
For some of the cases, the intent could be clear, like tops up to the upper limit when the limit is not known (and when limits are not always clear). However, I think that a simple top is still better than the other alternatives. For example, there is more context information to say ""I can top my limit"" than ""can you top me up"". It seems to be a bit confusing to use the terms top and up interchangeably. But then again, maybe this is part of my issue. 
As a final note, a more formal analysis of these words would be necessary to determine what makes a top. Does it mean the maximum number or does it really mean that you have the money?
Also, as an aside, can this sentence be rephrased as ""how can I top it?"": ""How can i top you up, please?""
Last thought: does the sentence: ""When he went to buy it, he could hardly wait, waiting for the moment he would see the price"" mean ""he could not wait to see it"" or ""to see"" (like a movie)? The context of this text seems more to me about seeing it and not about waiting. It feels like this question is less about intent and more about understanding the English in context. In fact, could this be about word sense disambiguation? I.e., the question could become about the word ""wait"" when used to mean wait a price in an online auction? What could the meaning of ""could hardly"""

What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","I have been toying with the idea of adding more words to alex's parser, so he can do more than just recognize the noun or verb, but also some of the other parts of speech, especially prepositions and conjunctions. I am wondering how much of these will be ""easy"" to add since they aren't part of his current lexicon as far as I can tell, and how easy it would be to implement them.
For instance, would the preposition after be something like, ""What are you saying?"" and then i need a list of possible preps like ""to"", ""at"", 'with' and so on to be able to recognize that? Do I look up those preposssibles in a separate table? Is this something that is easily implemented and just requires a few more tokens?

I don't have a strong background in computer programming so I'm wondering if anyone else has some ideas about what's the easiest way to tackle this. 
What other kind of grammatical information could I add to the parsing that would benefit the user? For instance I saw he has an ability to look-ahead at some points in the sentence to determine what sentence the pronoun belongs to (which is good for people who don’t speak or write well), what kind, or what person it could be. For an example of when a pronoun might appear, he looks at the verb's tense for examples like: in order to, in anticipation of, etc and for the future tense he uses the modal verbs will, will go, may, should etc. This is something else that he could add in I think. How could this also be implemented though?   I would imagine he needs to have the list or database of tenses available when he's doing it, not sure where that might come from. It also looks like he may have to use the part-of-speech and tense information together to make a prediction, which I could imagine might be very tricky to build in, it's not something simple like adding pre-prepositional or post-postfix modifiers.

I also thought it would be worth mentioning my data. The top upto limit for the data is 2 million, and currently about 3% is used. It is currently used by only a very small fraction of the users. I only have 10,000 users currently registered for testing and I haven't seen any issues. 
So I am not looking to get it wrong, but I wanted to make sure that this intent is correct. This intent seemed to fit best but there was no intent for this in the docs. There is an utterment for topUpsLimit, which seemed more of what I was looking for. However, this is only allowed when the current limit of top Ups is below 0, whereas the question is concerned with current usage of that limit at all. Any insight would definitely be appreciated!

TopUp Intents
Intents that are triggered when certain values are reached during the conversation and when limits are met. These intents are useful for triggering some kind of action when a certain amount of data (such as text messages) has been sent or when data usage limits have been exceeded, or both. Each of these intented is represented by an enumeration value of int. See the class documentation for details. (Note that top limit is set in seconds and that you do not get a positive value as the limit).

## Chapter 2: A Short Survey to Find Out About the People
### Section 1: What kind of people talk to the machine?
* This chapter explains the various ways in which people give their opinion to a machine.
#### Intents
There are two major ways of getting the users opinion. The first is to listen to them, the second way is called polling. There are lots of ways people communicate information to each other. For instance, people can give answers, ask questions, provide information, etc. In an opinion poll the respondents give an answer or answer a question. A survey is not a poll. It does not ask a single question or ask people for opinions and feedback. Instead the goal is generally to collect a lot of information. Some people would even call a survey a market research. Here are some examples of surveys that are used to find out about the market. We will use these examples in this chapter.

 * A market survey might be an online poll in Google or Facebook. They usually ask you how you feel about a certain product. This might include a product you are thinking of buying, which one product in your current market is your favourite, or which new product has caught your attention lately. You answer by clicking on a button. People often also ask which colour you prefer, what features you would expect in an iPhone, and many other questions. After having answered all the questions a report is shown to you that summarises the poll results. These are the results that companies look for. Based on the information that people have given, companies can now decide what to do. If people are asking which product to buy or the phone they should buy, then the company can use that and act on it. That's how companies make money. By providing a service. Companies use survey data to provide their service so customers can reach them more efficiently. Often companies have a contact at every branch or every phone. With that the customer can contact"

Can anyone tell me how to find the intent in natural language understanding?

A:
[EDITED: Added more detailed explanation on how NLP (Natural Language Processing) works and what is an Intent, what are the different Intent Types, and how you can identify an intent]
Natural language processing is basically a field in computer science in which a computer program is developed to understand and analyze human (natural) language. (More information here)
There are different types of NUmber (or Intents) and they are classified according to the type of information they provide (the information it provides can be either numerical / quantitative or qualitative (also known as categorical)). This is based on the fact that human beings can understand numbers but they can also understand qualitative information (like ""the temperature is very hot / cold"" etc.) In addition a person can speak about both. So there is also the possibility of having Intets to both - numbers and qualitative, as it can happen. This can help NPU to do more intelligent and efficient analysis. 
To be more specific, there are three different Intet types : Intent Classification  (Intent is about a type or category of a statement), Intent Detection ( Intention to detect the existence or absence of an Inteet)  and Intent Reasoning (reasoning about the Intented).
Now, I am not an expert but my understanding is Intnet can not be classified in one particular intent. It may have the intet as ""to make more money"", but it may also be ""a very good idea"" and not at all be associated with one intent type, but there can a lot of reasons to explain it, one example would be to see if there's an association for a product you're selling with ""more money"". So you cannot say it's only a Inten of the first category. I would say, it is associated to a particular intnet. However, the association between intnets and intent can always differ depending upon your domain and intents. There are some websites out there that have an extensive analysis of intets and their respective inten. For instance   the below link gives you an analysis about different intint and Intnets. As per your specific case you might be interested to read this article about ""how to identify"

I think I understand that top-up is transitive (a topup cannot be performed unless a top was previously performed). But I don't understand how to decide which intent applies given the above utterances. Can someone explain?

A:
–
It’s true, the top/up pair can only be used in sentences with the word top: the ‘up‘ is an adverb and it changes the meaning, but the main verb doesn‒t.
In a sentence, where up refers to time/position, we usually have a noun or a verb that modifies it. In that case, up isn„t the subject, and in that sense the sentence is not transmissive. (But then I could argue that the verb top is a little bit ambiguous, as it could also be transmissive.)"

The best matching intent is 
   topUpLimit
How can I find out if it is possible to use top ups if a transaction is below the topUPLimit?  is not the closest match.
In order to check if that is valid, one could say the intent of: is it possible  to make a  transaction  below a certain total amount? is different.  That is, it asks whether it's possible for some total amounts, whereas the question I want answers asks for the total of a group of amounts. So I would ask, for example: How should I interpret the sentence below? (If it makes any difference):  how much money should i have available in my top  up balance before making a purchase? i don't want topups. This is an example of how it would be used to ask a question that doesn't have a single ""topup"" intent. Is it correct to  ask for how many dollars one should have to top Up? I mean, to what degree do the two sentences relate?
Also is ""How to interpret this"" and ""how should  it be interpreted"" different? What I am looking for is if the ""this"" in both cases means the same thing: a sentence? a phrase? or more specifically, a part or a subset of the whole sentence, in this case ""I don' like top Ups. ""? Or do they have different significations? How would the person answering the  question interpret them? Can it matter how I ask it? The question is what do we call the set of all the possible ways a given question can be asked, how does it relate to how the questions can actually be answered in practice? And  which question could be an answer to the other? Should there be a way of telling which set is more or less relevant (for instance by looking at how people answer the actual questions in use)?
(If the way people interpret a query is important, then how do I know whether what I'm getting is from humans or machine?).

(10).
To what extent do your students agree with these observations? Do you think that this
discrepancy is indicative of a difference between English and French? If so, how? Can you explain it? What effect does it have on learning outcomes and/or teaching practices?

Hi, I have one more question about the intent extraction for the virtual world in the chatbot. For virtual, what are the two types of intent:
- Virtual world.
Is the above 2 intent is valid? Or is it just one of the type of virtual? Because in my case, i used the word virtual to describe the world where the conversation between the user and the bot is conducted. However in one example, the example says ""where can you obtain your virtual visa card?"". And according to the context, in that case we do not need to mention a type, but we are not sure if its virtual or just virtual. I just want to make sure that in general, we only use a intent type (virtual) to mean the whole conversation in virtual is between a user(bot) and a bot. Or just a single utterances of a conversation can have multiple intents. Thanks,

Note: For the sake of discussion, I'm ignoring the fact that the intent of card is already known or the user just wants to get his card, for the moment.

A:
If you are looking for an example I think your example might be wrong. If this is not the case then, well you have your own answer. 
I would say getCard is more a ""get"" action then a question. A question will likely come in the form of  ""what do I do with a card"". This is very different that asking for a certain card. So the question is a better example, maybe a bit wordy but I believe it makes more sense."

For me, the right answer is:
I can find the card that is most relevant to me by checking whether the phrase I am looking for is found within the description of the given intent.
This is because the user will look it up for the purpose of obtaining more information or actions, and not because I just happen to know the name of this card. The user, having used the intent 'find card', will not look for a card in the hope that it will happen accidentally. They will be expecting information on a specific virtual (and non-virtual) card, hence the 'finding' part is part of their query."

For both your questions: Yes you can get them. But the question you are raising isn't about the intent. It sounds like you're asking more like, ""What's the difference between a 'virtual card' and a card that I own, whether it's a regular physical product or not?"" In this case, there is no difference at all. 
What you would want to know here is whether or no you own the card. If yes you have a product, that makes it a real'real deal'. If no, you just made a bet, and if you lose, it is just a game. In that case there's no ""physical"" or ""virtual"" card to be concerned with. The card isn' t in your possession. Just like a horse you bet on. You won or lost. That's all there really is to it."

I would think a 'how' question is way easier to research with than a more complicated question where the answer would be the same in many different contexts. Am I thinking correctly?   The answer to the question, 'which virtual token to use' would probably vary depending on the scenario. I am asking about the 'best' virtual type. Not a single option, but a list of them, as the platform could support multiple types of tokens  in one scenario, and not in the next. Or a platform might have multiple providers so the number of choices would also grow.  Is this an acceptable question? I ask because this could be a large feature and it would take many years for this to be fully researched and documented.

As I wrote in the comments, the word you need here is ""Order"".
So, you are asking about the order, not the place. You might also ask ""What are the steps to order"" or ""Where do I order"", or a similar question. ""Are you ordering?""
I hope this helps :)
Cheers,
Tiago
@Tijo - ""Virtual"" and ""Payment"" are synonyms, so you should use one or the other. But I think ""Card"", ""Visa"" etc. are not. So ""virtual card"" could be replaced with ""phone card"". I don't know what the meaning is though. Maybe it's like a phone card for internet. In that case you could ask a lot of questions about it...
In most cases, ""where do u buy"" should be changed to just ""buy"". ""I'm buying a new shirt"" is not as natural English as ""a new one"". Same goes for places I believe. Like instead of ""Do you where I should go?"" you would ask about ""do you sell a shirt?"".
""How do order?"" could replace ""how to"", if that's your point: ""How can I get a VISA Card?"" ""order"". If the questioner knows you order by giving the details in your application, then that word should probably not be used. For people who just do not know, ask them ""did you apply?"" :) or, more directly, what is your intent here, and that is what you will use. I hope that makes sense!

For an entity which owns several cards, we could get the card by asking for the most valuable one, but I would expect that this entity owns multiple virtual and physical cards. If it is true to that statement then the entity should not be asking why it doesn't have its favorite, virtual, card already...

What are the most common and correct ways to form the question, ""is it?""

A:
You want the verb to be singular and the number of the thing to remain singular or countable.
It's very unlikely that the meaning of your sentence is ""can I have a card in virtual reality?"" because the word ""card"" can take a variety of meanings. 
The meaning you want is more likely to mean ""Do I (and you too) have any cards in my virtual-reality-equipped device?"" If that's the case, then ""it is"" is appropriate (or ""are"" for a more polite version), and you need to use the singular form of ""Card""
If you're trying to ask ""do I, as you understand me,"" then the correct verb would be ""Are""; if that isn't what you wanted but it's not clear what your question was, you could rephrase the sentence using ""I, me"" and then use ""am"" or ""have"".

It is currently capable only of:
""help"", ""me"", and ""send a message"".
I have already written: ""help"" and received a list of actions. I have not made ""message"" an available action yet. How can I go about making message available (or not)?
The actions are of the form: { ""action"" : ""text"",... }
Here are all the actions in the system. They can be added to in any order: https://github.com/toddf/Chatbot-API#actions

This is in C. The actions variable is an array of function pointers; the functions themselves are defined in actions[].actions. This is just a small version of my bot's intentions. There is no need to copy this here, as this can easily be obtained from the GitHub link. Also, the ""actions"" variable in this version is only a single string. A similar version would be: const int actions[] [] = {[1,""say""], [2,""list""]...}.
There is also no real need for a static array if you want to use multiple actions; just add the strings to actions dynamically, in reverse order. So, for example, instead of ""static const const"", use:const char action1 []=""send""; and then for each element of your array, use the function's name in that array. Or, even more easily, you can just declare actions like this:int actions []=send,list,send_message,....Then, each action is defined the same way you defined it in a normal function, except for ""name"" with the name of that function. To get the action name for send_messagestring.actions[0].name="""

The problem is that you can't know if the sentence is a question until it is uttered. So the system can have trouble deciding which intent to prefer. 
In the past, you'd see people suggesting that the question mark be used to mark ""is-questions"" (which makes sense because it indicates that a predicate is missing from the query). That's not the case in English because the predicate comes after the verb, which is just syntactically a little bit annoying. (You could of course do something like this in a context, but I'm not sure it's the proper thing to do.)"

There is no single correct answer, since the first utter is a single-choice question and the latter is also. But both are clearly single answer questions.
So, I assume it's one of the two (but how to decide?), but I can't really be sure. I guess it should depend on whether ""virtual card"" and ""order"" are independent words and thus can occur at the same time. If they are, ordering virtual cards can be a one-time activity, i.e. an order virtual ""card"". On the other hand, virtual orders can involve repeated ordering of virtual items.  This may depend, of course, on the context. For a more detailed account you need to ask a native speaker, e.g. on Yahoo! Answers."

I think that the only answer to your question should be: there is no answer.
The reason is that your utterances are ungrammatical and, as such, they are meaningless. That is, you can use them as a kind of sentence, like a noun or a verb etc. But it doesn't make sense: you are not describing something. You are using it. In my opinion, the word virtual is doing that work (and in other languages such a work is done by means of the verb to make, by the gerund, or by whatever). Therefore, I would say that you don't know. 
On the positive side, this gives you the space to invent your own language, to say what you want. Maybe there won't be a real language to express all of your possibilities. I have always believed in creativity, in making something new, so I don´t want you to believe that this is impossible to do."

The reason I am asking for this is that I feel like I know a bit of syntactical knowledge, but my knowledge has not been tested, so I need an answer for it.

For the part ""What is/are you?"", for the two possible ways to write the correct sentence, my reasoning is as follows:  I agree that the second choice is grammatically incorrect, however, in this case I'd use only the third option: ""I am/is he"". This is because, by using ""who/whoever"", my sentence is not about the speaker; rather, it is to emphasize a certain fact about somebody. Thus, ""Who are you"" is a statement, while ""You are/I'm he"" are questions. And since ""Is he the one I seek"" means ""Does he own the"

This answer assumes the customer is looking to make their first physical card physical. In the case of virtual cards, the process is different, see below. The answer is not correct if there is an intent to purchase another card at that time, unless there are other cards in your account that are not virtual
You can purchase a physical (or virtual) card from another member and have that card delivered. Asking to change the delivery address is a valid use case if you have an ongoing relationship with the bank/reseller and want the physical to be sent to a different delivery location than where you're currently residing.

I know the sentence have virtualcard has a meaning which is ""There is a card in which the owner has virtual property"". 
But why in all the examples, why don't I have one? I know that I am in the UK where ""virtual"" cards do not exist yet, but this is very strange, especially if it's a legal question.   I feel that something more should be there. Can someone help?
Also, I understand why have the virtual doesn't fit: it means ""to have (a real card, not a fake/virtual one) in your possession"" or ""there is something in my possession"".
Why have i have not virtual does not fit because in reality, you have no real ""have"" in you. You do no have it. I mean you do physically own it in this example, in fact your very own virtual money, so why not say that? Why use ""you""? Isn't it wrong?  If I had a piece of paper with the words ""I have money"" I don;t want to say ""my money"", I want you to understand that it is money I own (that's why it says ""i"", not ""mine""). But it would be wrong to translate it as ""He does have"", since he doesn;'t physically. He has it, yes. But I ""know"" it isn't ""real"" so how can I say this to the other person?  That he has real money? It's all confusing. It seems to me that these two sentences have different intent and if they have then we'd have ""a virtual one"". But this doesn' mean they don' fit. Why isn this the case? And if ""Why do I not?"", ""why i do"", ""do i"" don have and ""don't have"" mean something completely different, then why use these words?

389,i thought i was going to get a virtual card but i haven't received it yet how can we resolve this?,"['resolve card', 'virtual card', 'resolve card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","; card, not virtual? card is a synonym of virtual, right? Should a person who has used the word, card before, be given more consideration, as a speaker, than someone whose first experience with the verb was virtual.

The best answer to my query above is: if we are considering the use of a term within a sentence, then the term used in that sentence counts. However, the speaker of the sentence is not necessarily the person of more importance in terms of determining a particular interpretation. A sentence may be ambiguous on its own and may need contextual information to resolve the ambiguity. This is true in all contexts – for example, when we don't know who the listener to our sentence will be (so we make no assumptions), but we know that the listeners will not always agree with our interpretation of an ambiguous sentence. It is just part of human communication. So, my best advice would be to consider what the most appropriate interpretation is, on the basis that you want to communicate, and to choose the interpretation that best fits the circumstances. For instance, a user may have used virtual once before in a conversation, but never virtual as an adjective or noun (they may not even understand or know the meaning of this term) and therefore may never have thought about it as the way we might interpret. You need to judge how appropriate it is in each context and in which way you will use the virtual term. In short: use your best judgement."
390,please help me get a virtual card,"['get card', 'virtual card', 'get card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","get virtual cards?

For those who don’t know what a “virtual card” is, it is a credit card with no actual card attached to it. These can be used in person to purchase things online, and you can even use them in a store to make a purchase. You can then go and pick up your real credit/debit card and have the money paid directly off of it in your bank account.
The intent of this question is how the system interprets the two different variations on the request. If you think about the first, we want help us. Help is one of the three intents in the LUIS grammar. This is probably the most obvious way to use this request, but it does not necessarily have to be that way. The second one is more difficult since it can also mean ‘get‘. I think the question would still be valid because ’get help“ does have a context. It can refer to getting help from a machine and not from people. For example, in an operating system, a command might be, ”get a list of running programs„. However, I don't think this particular utterances should be categorized as ″get″. 
So that answers what it means, what is it called? The question asks how to interpret the different ways of making the intent known. One way is by making a request for an action that has a specific set of parameters that are required for it to work properly. A virtual credit or debit card is essentially one such action. So if the only way there was of doing this would require the card number to go, why not just say that? If we ask for something that requires us to do certain tasks, the „help‟ part would be implied. ‣"

The answer is ""yes it's correct"" as the first part of the sentence is a question. However I think the second part makes this question less clear: the cards are not where, they are a what. In other words, it sounds like we are asking ""what is your answer"" not ""where do you look for your answers""

B. can you give me 10 (i want to spend)

Thank you. 
EDIT: Thanks for the answers everyone. So, I agree that C and G are correct, even though C is somewhat odd. But I still think that A and B aren’t. It seems odd to me to say that I have gift cards. That means that the gift is something of mine, that is, a physical entity. This seems like it implies a certain ownership over the virtual gift. On the other hand, C makes sense to use because it doesn”t seem that owning something is necessary to buy. If someone buys my virtual credits, then I can have them spend them myself (as a kind of credit), but they might be my credits (and I am the real-world owner), as in: 1. My friend is giving me a car. (virtual). 2. He gave me his virtual cards, and I used them (credits) on his behalf. In 2., we are speaking about virtual assets that are owned by the friend. They are virtual, in that they are not physical items, but owned (by him) nonetheless. Now, A seems strange, because we do not have the word “card“ to mean ”a gift‘ because that would be redundant. We already have ‘gift card„ so why not say „virtual gift,‟? It sounds redundant to us. However, the idea that a card is a form of gift that can be bought seems to work. A gift-card is not a ‟virtual‌ gift because a real gift requires an intention to give an item of real value, or the item itself is of tangible value. The card just ‚is‛ a type of value and it can act as a store of a value to be spent by someone else, as we saw in"

Also thanks to @Lance, whose comments helped me clarify. If this isn't what I actually want to do, let me know! I do appreciate the help. <3
Summary
Acceptable and accepted are both acceptable and acceptable, however, acceptable is used only when the context is a card and it is more appropriate than accepted. Accepted in this context means 'accepted by'.  For this reason, only accepted should be used. For cards, both are acceptable. There are some regional differences that apply to accept and accept, so use the ones that you are most comfortable with in your situation. The differences between accept/accept in cards and in a situation are the most subtle and can lead to misunderstandings about the usage and meaning. However, the subtle difference between used in and used to is not an issue here. A card can have many uses, not just one, whereas"

My question is, why is ""accepting"" used over ""rejecting""? What's the reason for this? Does ""the answer is"" or ""this is a"" imply accepting/receiving? Do any of these work? 
Edit:
I know this question may be a little odd. I am not looking for a synonym in place of accept or reject, but rather, I'm looking into the usage of ""Accepts"", which seems to be used in the context of an action, while ""Rejects"" seems like it's a thing or a person.
""Accepting the offer means that it is accepted by the other party, whereas rejecting it means it isn't taken seriously.""

https//:www6.youtube.c-/watch?v=wY-0VH9zc2o
The context I found these examples in was for accepting things on a website, specifically in relation to ""agree or disagree"" questions, such as: https//www8.youshare.jp/item/3c6-3
It made some sense to me that the action would be: agree, disagree, accept/disagree, etc. However, it didn't make sense that ""This is an accept"" meant that you were accepting the fact that there is no food, rather than that they are going to provide food. In short, ""The fact is that I accept this"" does not seem to mean that one is receiving it. Instead, one could be accepting as it pertains to other things, however the meaning is still not receiving. It's confusing and I would like to know why. :)

@Nathantietje : Yes, use the correct one in that sentence and in similar ones. But you're right, as long as there's just one sentence, I would use useCards, it's easier to read. In the situation I've presented, the sentence is quite long, though, so it has an even greater impact. Maybe I should stick to either UseCard or UseWorld. Anyway, great answers. +1

A better description of the rule can be found on MSO: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/140131/why-"
403,it will be fine to use at any establishment that accepts mastercard,"['accepts mastercard', 'accepts mastercard']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","The question is: Does any of these have a different meaning than the original uttering, in light of its context (which in this case is a restaurant) or the context of a broader conversation? Or is it a matter of semantics, i.e. that at no establishment is ""it will not be fined""?
I ask because ""if it be so"" was used earlier in the sentence, but ""at any"" makes sense here.
Note: I am not asking for the grammatically correct form of the question, that would be to say which is correct as opposed to which has different or more common meaning, as well as which I should use in different contexts or contexts with different connotations. Rather, I would like some help in my own understanding by the use of some examples. I ask a question on ELU to help me with the grammar or semantics and help explain to a friend who is trying to learn and teach English (not in formal schooling) that we are using different words with similar but different meanings. My question comes in after a discussion, and so I don't understand the nuances well enough to ask the proper questions. But please help. Thanks :)
Edit:
Thanks for answers thus far. In the case of ""It will pay you no matter how much"" does this mean that they accept master card and are able to make the payment? If not, is this something that might be possible to know ahead of time? Is there any possibility to be able pay a fine with a credit card (I'm not sure)? I think there's some confusion as to what exactly I'm asking here, so if this is not clear and you can help, please comment as necessary.  I did clarify the intent of this part of my sentence. Thank you again for your help and time. :) 
Thank you all for helping
Final Edit:   After much back and forth with answers from @jkd and @John Coleman here's the final edit. There's nothing more to add so far except a brief explanation of what was going on. The intent is to simply get a clarification on the finer details. It seems there are two different questions here: what is going in to the mind of whoever utters this sentence?

A:
If you look to the API, you'll find that there are two types of card usage: 
""usage"" for the use of the payment card: you should expect that this can vary across different implementations. The API does not provide much information about this, except for a vague statement: this usage includes things like a ""purchase"" or a payment.   However, in the ""Card Usage"" section of your link, the section about ""Purchasing"" you find some additional details about card use. In fact, there is no way to know the limits or what a specific implementation considers a particular usage, but you can assume that some are quite liberal. For example, Visa and MasterCard both allow their cards to be used for purchases in an online shop (without requiring any specific merchant information): they even have a link to where you may check if your card supports online payments."

Based on your last post, your intent is to use the card. You will then need to change this in the response:

...

409,is there anywhere my card will not be accepted?,['accepted card'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","accepted payment? and accepted offer?

In this post, I would like to explore how the answer to this question depends on how one intends to use the term ""the utterances"" for your card-accepting agent.
Let's start off with two common use cases:
1. Accepting credit card or debit card payments using your mobile device
2. Rejecting an offer for goods or services in exchange for some amount of cash
I think that we can safely ignore the first use case. For many users, ""accept"" would be a verb that would not have a direct meaning in context. Instead of a card payment, it would probably refer to accepting a payment.  It could, however, still have an implied meaning if you used the phrase as part of the name of your company. So, that use-case should really be: ""Accepting offers using my smart phone"".
Now, let's turn to our second use. We could also say, in our example, is this: rejected offer or did I accept an offen in the past? However, when you look at the meaning of ""an offer"", it's clearly not really the same as the other word choices. If we mean, was this an exchange of money for services/goods? If so, we could use ""offer"" instead. However if we want to know if I accepted this exchange offer, then we need to look to what we meant by the verb ""to accept"". 
This can all get rather complicated, so I'm going to try to avoid all these ambiguities and just look straight at what each word says. Let's say we just decided to choose to accept offers by using the word ""offen"" (I don't think this is right - I suspect that I could be making a common mistake, but I'll try it out here anyway.)   Then what does it mean to ""reject"" an "" offer""?  The verb doesn't really help. I can think of one possible meaning - that the offer is rejected. The other meaning is that it is declined - but that doesn’t really say anything useful. ""Decline"" does not say that something happened in time in a past sense. It also does nothing to help us distinguish this meaning from the idea of rejecting an item in future time - or"

or
Can I see your Visa card please?
If you use your credit cards for payments, it's possible to see which of your transactions are for which credit, with your issuer.  If you are a MasterCard user, Mastercard will tell you which card is currently being used, and where. (But you can't use their API to do so directly.)
There is no standard way to specify what ""card"" is meant. So you get an error message for an unrecognized intent. If there were such things as ""generic"" intents, you'd say something like ""use card"".

What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","A person can be an employee or a customer. The person is in a company with a name, and the person will be performing work of some kind.
The company could be a business. A business is also a place. That is, a person in this case could represent the company they work for. 
One can also be part of a group, such as a student. They are attending a school or school district. If the business name is that of the school, then the student is a part as well. One can say that the people of one school perform services for another. I think this is what they call a service business or service company. There can't be more than one service. This business can exist on land or at sea. Land businesses exist only where land exists (on land). At the same time, at least for some schools, the name of that school is used for businesses that serve that community, whether they exist or not. It is possible, for example, that a college student may have a job that involves the provision of customer service: they might receive phone calls from a large company, they may answer questions from customers who call, etc. In this sense, one could say a phone company is providing a kind of service to people that use their services. Thus, it is more accurate, in my opinion, to say the phone companies accept cards. But a more interesting way might be to use the phrase that business accepts the card. Here, you can see that it takes a bit of imagination for a human being to think that accepting a card is something that can take place for business, but it's not impossible to do."

I think that use a card is a very general purpose and it is not clear if payment is intended. 
Similarly, will you use your card here? is very ambiguous since it seems to be talking about a payment, and a user could use it to indicate something else, for example he wants to check the balance on the bank account.
So what is best for use here? Or would it be acceptable to ask about the usage scenario?

In this case the client and the server are using the same AADB2C configuration, meaning that they both belong to the Azure AD. The AIDL interface is implemented in the Client and it is using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols.OpenIdConnect for communicating with the AOIConsumer. 
The flow is working properly and all the expected scenarios are working: I have a ""sign up"" page with a button, when I press on that button I get a popup with some instructions and a link which I should follow. Once I follow the link (redirect to my application in AOKS), and I do a successful login to get redirected back to a redirect URI which will be received after the redirect (the AOVendor redirects me back in a page in my app which needs to redirect the user to another page where the payment can be made).
But, is there a way, even if the answer is yes or no, to know if my client card is usable/unusable or the card holder account (AOK) which is being created during the registration? I tried to look for it in documentation and samples but couldn't find any information about it, only regarding the authentication token which should be send in that redirect request. Any hint of direction on where is it documented or how can I figure out this information would be great.

We can say that it refers to the first meaning if the use of card is understood to be the one that means using a debit or credit to pay for some product or service. 
For example:  

  Use credit for this

To the extent to which an intent is expressed in the verb phrase, I think that the first three are better choices in this particular example than the others because of their syntactical structure.
The last two would be better used when the sentence expresses only a simple yes/no question about a person's state, i.e., not an action to be carried out. (A card is ""accepted"" when it is taken and paid for. The question, ""where is your card?"" could refer to your wallet, the cashier, or even your person. In such cases, we usually don't know the specific card and the question might better be expressed as something like ""can I see your ID?"" or ""do you have a driver's license?"")"

@Pietergoedkoop I am not sure what I should say in your post. If you mean something like what the OP meant, I think ""pay"" is fine. ""Pay for"" or ""buy"" sounds more as the opposite of what they were looking for. Pay as a verb has a very specific meaning.

F. RavnerOct 19 '10 at 16:54
This isn't a technical English question, so my apologies for not providing more context. :)
The OP was talking about a business, and what is their goal in asking that question? They were trying to determine if the person was a paying customer. So if it's a personal blog about the owner's family life, maybe they're trying for the ""About me"" section? If it is a restaurant where they want to advertise their services, they are selling a service. I'm not going to go into the details here, because there is no context and we don't have your website's context, unfortunately. But if you are looking to understand the use of ""pays"" in a context where it could be ""paying"" it would be the context of how a company or product owner uses ""where can I pay?"" The company would probably have to answer that they sell goods/services. That isn`t a definitive answer though. It all depends on how they use the term. And that's the problem. There is too much context without the website. :(
As far as grammar goes, you should use ""that"" for ""they"" (in this example). But I would say ""for"" if I was writing something similar to this. :).
-
p.s. it doesn't sound right, pay as payment. You can't pay off a debt with credit/debit card. This is called ""payment"". :) I just thought I'd let you know. Hope it helps! :) It really doesn` t matter if they have credit, debit, or prepaid card, in this context they all have money. We are talking strictly about their"
428,where should my card work?,['work card'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","card's? work, where?

Work card, work where. Which of the two would imply that where is an additional entity (which would need work-card, in its turn). Or it would be an auxiliary to the verb work (as I guess), and thus a kind of modal. Or an adverb? Or the place of work itself? 
I'm not asking for the right grammatical term, but for a good analysis and explanation of these kinds of questions.
EDIT. I've found this in http://www.thefreedictionary.com/work-where:
""In the work: the person who is working at the time; the job itself"". I would say this is a perfect synonym to work. Thus, it doesn't mean a place to perform work at.   However, ""where should I work?"" seems to be the most common case and that's the one I'm struggling to find. The second case, I feel, sounds weird in my own ears. For instance I wouldn't use work the card to say that I'd like to visit a country where a lot of people do card (a card is, after all, a card for money or money's sake or for some other purposes...)  Or work to tell me that you're going to a job in that country. And work as a verb, as in work in a certain job, is rather rare. In my point of view any one of them could convey the idea of a desire to do something. But it's rather unclear which one to chose and which nuance, that would fit the meaning. It's a matter of taste, really. So how could I say ""I want to live in this country"", while ""In this (where?) do you work""?  In the case of ""work the thing"" I can imagine ""do the things"" (like in ""the work"") would make more sense than ""use it"".  So my question is this:  If work ""thing"" makes no sense then what about work/ ""in"" where (or at what place)?  Does someone has an idea here? And please don't suggest I should use ""that"" instead of  ""what"" because I know perfectly that a single word could express a different nuance of different kinds, and I don' want that to happen to my words"

If you were talking about a person, you'd say ""Area is accepted"", and it would be understood that you are referring to someone who is trying their hardest to avoid the area in question. If you just asked ""Is it accepted?"", it wouldn't necessarily have to be a matter of trying hard."
430,places i can use the card,"['use card', 'use card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","find an airport nearby?

I’m going to answer my own question by saying that I think it depends on how the ‘place‘ is defined. If it is just some geographical region (place) in which you want to do something then I”d put use_card as the intended meaning, as in „places i/we can make use of my/our card“. But if it„s something more specific, like the place a bank is located in, then “find the bank near me‚ may do it.
As a side note, my personal feeling is that the term ‚locality‛ should be defined to mean a place, and †neighbourhood‡ would be more fitting for a neighbourhood. This would mean that ‪nearest airport‫ might not do as well, whereas a nearby place would work. 
Note: I am basing this answer on the assumption that all three of the listed possibilities are grammatically correct."

Q1
Can i buy groceries with the online shopping service

what should I do? Can I use the ""Can I buy online with this payment method?""

If you have any advice about the Japanese one, the Arabic one will look pretty similar to the English one. So I would need some more explanations for each of the problems. Thankyou
The Japanese version is here:  http://nlg.jstacs.or.jp/j-english/
Please check the website of my course, you'll find a link there. You can download the file there and see what I meant. It's a Japanese grammar course
Thank you very much
(I have to correct the grammars as I go along. I'll send the corrected ones later)
EDIT
For example, can you say this sentence in Japanese? If it's so hard for Japanese as it might seem to us, imagine how difficult it must be for my native speaker
買い物(shopping)にご使用なさい
Do you understand that this is an ""I use your card in my online shop"" sentence? But, in fact, that sentence does not make sense at all, as you cannot use a sentence to buy something. Does this mean that it is really an action phrase instead of an utterancet? Does that mean ""use your credit on my shop""?

In the above case, I would say 'Do not accept cards' is valid, and I don't think you need a 'best fit' intent. If I had to choose between one, two, or three, the three would be:
Do accept 
Accept  or  Accept card
Don't accept

The first case seems intuitively to be the more specific, but I've been thinking a lot about this and I'm not sure that I actually know what the ""intents"" of a particular sentence like this should be. It seems reasonable that a question asking about places that accept a specific kind of card could be answered with either the intent I described above, as well as the additional intent accept the card.
But the other case is also intuitive: there's no obvious need to specify a card and then ask a further question about the places. I have no trouble imagining a conversation in which ""what places accept"" is followed by the actual question ""do you want to accept this card?"". I don't think that in such a world, you'd get multiple answers for each intended question, since both the question and its answer would be part of one single, complete utterances."

In the absence of a ""use card"" utter-able, is there a better term to use for one of the other?

""Can I use the card where i'm standing?""
It would be the same as this:

A:
""Will my business will take any cards?""  --> YES
 ""Will the business  'I' take 'the cards'?""--> NO
It is quite clear that ""any"" is a mass noun and ""the"" refers to an object.
But in your original sentence, the object is not a card but an entire line of credit. Hence the answer of the first intent is incorrect."

I don't quite see it either. I think that, as long as the sentence was written without the ""will"" and ""accept"" verbs, it could be read that the writer is trying to say:
""There are a lot of places selling gas in the city and the author is asking, ""What is their policy? Will they accept your card?""
The other possible interpretation would be that it's written for a very young audience, and that ""filling stations"" refers to the pumps at gas stations.

You are using ask in a somewhat unusual way, but I see no problem with it. Why are the first four words that follow ""why"", so important?

Edit: I see that the context has changed in my response to the other posts in this thread. I had a brief thought about the difference between asking “why“ and ”in a particular context: does the ‘why' mean the particular purpose or the broader reason that led to that purpose, or perhaps a more neutral statement along the lines of: ’In order for the purpose to succeed'
Any help with this would also be appreciated. Thanks
P.S I‘m also having difficulty with a couple of the words in that second question, which I will try hard not to do in future posts. Any help on that would still be welcome. The word „context„ is particularly hard for me to understand, in particular because I cannot find anything about it on www.dictionary.com
This is not as silly as it may seem, it is something that is really frustrating me. If someone can give my this problem a few minutes thought it would really be much appreciated!

440,i cannot verify my identity,"['verify identity', 'verify identity']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","check identity?, ensure identity, check my id?, prove my claim?.
I am leaning toward the former because it is more explicit in saying it's about a subject's identity: to verify it. 
Is ""verifying my identify"" or ""prove my ID"" better here? Is this a matter of taste? If I am not mistaken, ""ensure"", as in ""To ensure your ID, you should prove that you are who you say you
are. You can use a driver's license, a passport, or a social security card for identification when you need to prove to a store clerk or waiter that it really is you."" seems to fit the intent better. It is not so much about verifying, but ensuring. Can someone confirm?

A:
The closest sense of'verify' that I would suggest is is 'expose to the light, to make visible, show the existence of' -- so, 'I will verify your identity.'
'Verify identity' is a rather odd, and unidiomatic, phrase. We typically say 'probe for information, try to learn' etc. for that purpose. In some situations (e.g. 'when he is being interrogated', 'at a bank' ) 'ensuring' might be a better fit. The following, in a way, might cover both:   'Verification' (of identity) = 'Proving identity'."
441,i do not have what is required to prove my identity,"['prove identity', 'prove identity']","Given the utterance: {}.

A:
.
I've been pondering this problem for a bit and the problem statement (from the OP) is ambiguous. One could argue that it's the last clause of the first and first the third. I think this is a problem, as the three options are not equivalent to each other. Let me try a solution using a fictional argument, which may be applicable in your context: 
Let F and G be functions with the properties F(x) = F (x).
   Then, F=G
(I. Proof by contradiction)
Hence, it is self contradiction that F not equal G. This contradicts our premise F equals F. Therefore F does not not equals G and thus F is different from G (not equal)."

A:

443,i am having trouble verifying my identity,"['verifying identity', 'verifying identity']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","verifying that one is a specified person? checking a person’s ID?

The following definitions assume that an entity, such as the speaker of the sentence and the listener of that sentence, has a well-defined identity that is being verified. For example, it might be the person on file as a student at the University, or the name under which that person presents themselves at a particular social function.
A simple definition of identity is that the entity is one and single thing at any given time, for example: “I am Jack Smith“. The identity of a single person is their name, social position and physical appearance, as well as any other information a social situation calls for. We say that this person has their identity, and that name is known as their ‘name identity‘. This person may change names, but the identity remains, because of how the information about the individual has been stored; and so they may, with effort, be made to present their new names at each occasion. In any case, we are concerned that identity be well defined. But in the situation we describe, the subject is also an individual, so identity can be used in this context. 
Verification of Identity may refer to the process of comparing what one knows to a set of known things that are assumed to be true and correct; or to an attempt to establish what is or is not true, i..e verification. It is generally used where something is assumed known to one or more parties; but may include, when used correctly, situations where a truth must be confirmed, verified or established, by some means. Verified identity refers to some kind of authentication procedure. Identity verification is used when you wish to identify a specific person based on what you know about them, rather than using some other means that will not produce the same, unambiguous result (e.g. a fingerprint).
Identity verification has many uses beyond the context of confirming a real identity to another. As mentioned, identity verification may be employed by a law enforcement agency trying to determine that a criminal is indeed the suspect they are looking for, to confirm their legal standing. Another example might involve a financial institution that wants to make sure that they have the correct information before sending money. They could also be verifying a client — their identity and their right to spend‭"

What are the possible error codes? Is there a standard set of error cases? I'm aware of:
1. Success
2. Invalid data
3. User has cancelled
4. Verification failed
Do you have any other advice on error handling? Thanks
Edit: I'd like to clarify my scenario. The error would be received and handled by an external party. If the error is handled, I want it to do a certain action (or not do at all).
For instance, an SMS provider may send an alert to the user. Is that the correct intent in this scenario? Do I need more than one intent? If so, how do I know which intent is triggered by which response code? 
I'd also like some advice about the structure of the intent. Should I create an intent for each different verification response that could be triggered? Or should I have a single intent and use the same response to represent multiple different scenarios with different action? Which one is more useful? Any other tips about intent structure are very much appreciated!
Thank you :-)

I am thinking it makes no difference for the sentence that it be in the affirmative form, but that does not seem right (verify identity, verify my name). 
If it does make a difference, then the first sentence is correct because if one wants to find out his identity in a given case, it has to be verified."
446,the app doesn't know it's me,['know app'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","In the first case, I have to explicitly say that the user is me (a person) and the intent is known. This seems somewhat verbose and redundant. Is this just a case of ""best practice"" or is there a more specific rule? 
The same applies with the second case:
I am not sure how to phrase this. I don't think ""I"" (the user) can be the speaker of such an intent. Maybe I am wrong but, in my understanding, it should be ""know app"" to express that ""the app knows who I (user) am"".   What I think is: ""The app wants to tell the device: I know you and I want to know your name"" would this be acceptable? Or should I just go with ""i want the my device name"".
Also, should one use a ""me or I"" type of sentence, a me type or an i type? I understand the distinction between the two, but I also think they sound very similar (me and me), so should they be used interchangeably? The second type is more explicit and sounds more natural.  I wonder why Apple's official app guideline does not use both (if I use the right terms).
Edit: My confusion stems from the different way that Android handles it. In my opinion, the same would apply to Android apps. However I haven't tested it on an Android yet.
Please bear in mind that I'm trying to build an app that will work on both iOS & Android. Hence, please give examples for both platforms (although I'd like a straight, plain explanation).  Also, any explanation regarding the difference between iOS and Android will be of interest to me since I plan to develop the iOS app with Swift, and develop a web application using Javascript and Node.js for Android app. But the Android part is secondary. (Yes I do know that they are not mutually exclusive, just saying that my Android project has its own importance). Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.!
P.S:  ""My"" has more than one meaning for English, so I might be confused about the usage of either ""my"" in this question or ""mine"". Thanks for the clarification. :)

My identity is a part of my existence, not some independent object. This candidate might be best construed using the verb 'belong', in the same way the word 'be' might. But 'i belong (to p)' seems to have the wrong shape, and not a verb that would fit this purpose. 'I have' has the correct shape. We need to find some other agentivative verb: one that can fill in as subject: I belong to this. (This is not quite the case, but a plausible first draft.) This can be done by using 'exist': Iexist. i belong and I exist: This seems the closest fit in form. However, there is something awkward still left: the agent doesn't exist, so the sentence is still incomplete. How can we complete the phrase? The verb can still be 'to exist', but this is an abstract verb, one used for the predicate 'exists'. The most natural place to put the clause 'as i' is between the existent subject and the existing verb; so, using this form, we can finish the above with: as i, i am. Or, in words: 'As Me, I Exist'. This completes the argument, as it has now shown that, for any entity, it can exist with respect to any claim it might make. If there are two candidates for a role, the most apt one is used, regardless of the specific form used. In other cases, a suitable form may be selected according to form or function. For instance, where one uses 'prove' as an interrogative, or as a form of affirmation or negation of identity, 'are' rather than 'is' in some cases because 'can' or 'does' are not suitable. And where we are talking about a proposition, its subject is either a noun ('a thing'), pronoun ('it') or a word denoting a concept ('what'). In the latter case 'it exists' serves as good a placeholder as any other, although some philosophers and logicians prefer 'a proposition exists', using what could be understood as the abstract concept'something exists'. Other verbs might serve as well.

Can one have trouble in proving or proving something? 
I am asking because I don't know of a better word in English to describe this idea. Is there one? A better one maybe? One that is common, more or less? What about in other languages? Any ideas? Thanks!
Edit: This seems to be similar to the question asked here: https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/12086/difference-between-prove-and-show-in-the-context-of-identifying-myself

A:
The following is a bit more abstract than the other answers here.
We can ask questions about ""identity"" in a number of ways, so to speak. One is ""What am I?"" - what is'me' in various contexts? Or ""Who am i?"" What are some of the things I am? This is similar in some ways to how one asks the questions, ""How are you?"" or ""what kind of day are we having?"".
Now let's say we are asking about a ""thing"" or a set of things - ""which things are mine"" (or ""are we still friends?""). Then the most basic question would be one of identification -  ""Am I this?"" which would have two different possible answers - 'yes', or 'no'. One might ask a more specific question ""am I the man wearing this tie?""
So one would want to know whether ""yes, I can tell you the answer to that question"" is an identity claim.  One can also ask ""how can I prove that to you?"", which is another identity question. This can go on, in terms of how specific one needs to get before ""proving"" makes sense, and if we allow any number and combination of identity claims, we will eventually get to where one is trying to prove to someone else that the person claiming identity really is who he says he is. I'm also going to make a point of emphasizing that ""you"" as used in the context of ""who are y ou?"" is NOT the same person. It's not ""Are y u?"" but ""I need to understand who y OU are...""
There are many questions one can answer, though. Here is my top 6: """
457,i cannot prove my own identity,"['prove identity', 'own identity', 'prove identity']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","(1) I cannot identify (name) myself as X, but I can prove that I am X.
[Note that this is NOT an identity problem]
I could be a twin sister with her. She is not an alien. I know that she is me. But I just can't prove her identity, i.e. the identity proof (1)' in the post. 
If she denies my identity in an argument I have no response to because she knows she has to deny me, the conversation ends, and I leave the room. If my sister knows that my twin has a sister, my question is whether she can be expected to recognize her as her identical twin or as a stranger. There seems to be little point in trying to prove the truth of my assertion that there are such things as identical twins, since this fact will be an assertion, an opinion. And opinions will not convince her: she will believe her own opinion, even if she cannot defend it. So is proving this identity truth or opinion? Why does the fact that we can speak about the existence of twin sisters have a bearing on the debate? Or is this just a red herring? 

 (2)I cannot name my self as x but you may be able to name it as 'X'.
This is a variant of (i), with the difference being that it assumes that you can name some thing as me without claiming that the thing in question exists. This assumes an existence problem, not a identity one. It's not clear, to me at least, that proving the nonexistence of a thing would be any more convincing than proving its existence. (And if you think the converse, then it's even less clear to you that one could prove existence without being able - by the same argument - to show it.) But if existence is taken for granted, (ii) seems more reasonable. We don't need to bother with proving existence: we already have it to hand. All we need is for your name of me to fit the description that defines me; for it is your job to decide that a given name and a particular description describe the identical thing. For this reason I'm inclined to say that (iii) is more plausible: it takes for given that identity proofs exist.

 So I could not prove your identity as I, X's twin."
458,my id won't be verified!,['verified d'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","verified r? unverified s?
Note that the question above concerns the veracity of the user; we're not interested whether the system thinks the person is actually a bot, or if the bot is just pretending to be a human.
I have also considered the id of @verified but I've noticed that I get a 404 when I request a user's id if they haven't verified their account yet, but this may be because verified id is for users, not bots (and it only shows up if I'm on a page other than /users).

A:
As I understand the documentation, verified and unconfirmed users' ids should be different.

A:
""What's up?""
This might sound a bit stupid, but in Android it's quite common to ask a ""What do you want?"" question as apposed to an ""Ok, where are you"" or ""Where am I?"" one.
I guess you might also ask ""How can i help you?"" (like in a chat), but that depends on your application and your user base."
460,i can't verify my identity,"['verify identity', 'verify identity']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","verify that i am an agent?

Given this utterances, i have two intents, ""Verify Identity"" and ""Check For Agents"".
I am using the first intent for: ""i can not verify your identity"". ""I checked your user name and password; you are not an authorized user"". Or ""You are an unauthorized human visitor"". Etc, etc.
When someone uses ""verify identity"" i just show an error message with ""your identity could not be verified"". But i do not show the user's username and passord for security reasons. 
The other intent is used by: When they try to register or login into the application (the application is a mobile banking app). Here i display a success message, and the login details of that user and a button so they can check it. The user clicks the button, the server receives the details, verifies if those details are correct and if not, show a message. This can be used when the mobile app is offline and does not have internet access and then the app displays a ""check internet connection"" message as an alternative way of verifying the internet conectivity
This is all about security and safety on an online application. I know that in the real word the username of my client is not safe, so i know the password is safe because of hashing, but, in this application i only store user_id and their password on the database. There is no way anyone could steal or crack their usernames and passwords from me. So is there anything wrong with this approach? If not i will use one of the intants for the ""can not identify yourself"" case. If there is nothing wrong i should use the intent that is more specific, right? i guess the second intent will be ""Can I identify myself""
Thanks!
EDIT
If anyone is wondering what are the other intant that are missing, they will come when i start to add more of those: Can I add, can i register, is this a registered app and so on. These intetnts do have a name, just that they have to be made in such a way that if i change my mind at any time, without changing the system, it would not break all the existing intets and intects.

The problem
My understanding is correct that there is no clear one right answer to the question. 
It is also my understanding that the term ""identity"" can have two distinct meanings. One is related to self, and the other is unrelated to that. That is, my personal sense is that I can verify self-identification without verification of other-related identification. In the latter case I will have to take another route. I do not understand that this is so. Is what I understand correct? If it is not, can anyone help me see why?   I see that my questions about this are not very well formulated, but I hope this helps to clarify what my real question is. This is what it boils down to. So I should add that it would be helpful if someone pointed out how the different usages fit in with each other, with respect to different possible intents, of utterances like the above. My intuition is it fits well. Also, it helps if I find out what the right answers are to my question about identity in the self vs identity as pertaining to other.

Given two students at a large university who are assigned to the same course: John (who is a woman) and Jane (a man). How should the course's instructors handle John who asks them the standard introductory questions about the assignment (i.e. what do you want students to learn in the unit)? How do they handle the ""identity questions"" which John might ask of them? (The instructors know that the student who does not identify as a man is female.) How would they deal with the question of ""I am feeling anxious about having to provide my gender identity to you"" from Jane? How does their handling of Jane differ if she were a male? Are there any additional considerations they might be asked to include in their responses to Jane and the class overall? Is there a correct answer, and if so, who gets to decide? Do the instructors' attitudes toward the identity issue influence their behavior as they relate to it? Does it matter that Jane is actually male while John is clearly female? If so why? Can Jane's request that his identity be ignored somehow be granted at the expense of someone else's well-being? In what ways? The instructors could take any of several approaches:

I don't know what to say here because I have never done this before. But   is always a good answer for any new question. It has the added advantage of being true. This one could have more nuance to be sure, but it does the job. If the person persists, you could say something like  ""But, I am not sure that is what you mean."" That is true, though. They could mean a different thing. The question is ambiguous. That makes it a little difficult to answer. You could always use some creative word play. Here are some others I could think of:

A: People often use their ID for things other than checking in at a restaurant or bank. i have my ID in my wallet. I am going to go pick it up and give it to you. You can put it on your body or on the keychain that you have in your pocket.ii. people use the ID when they want to do business with someone. When you go to a bank, they ask for your ID, and then they look you up in their system.iii. People use it when talking to others. For example, “You know what, I know that my mom is on a diet, but I don’t know the name of the product that she is trying to lose weight with yet.” iv-i.i-vi. If you think about it like this, it does not make sense to say, i, ii, etc. for i the intent is not as important as i i is something you do all the time and you need to have it, so you always need it with you! ii ii is also something that is required of you all of time, therefore i ii can be considered the most common. (But if you‘re reading the question about ‘intent“ you should understand that there is no standard answer.)
In the case of v-ix, v and x are not considered common because there could be any intent. So the commonality could just be the fact that they can all be used to prove something about a subject.vii-viii have the same reason; the other two do not really fit because you can have any reason. In fact you could have a reason for doing any of these tasks. As we‚ll see, the answer to this question depends not just on what someone chooses to call it and not in a subjective sense, as if they were deciding what„ they thought of their choice.

A:
[Edit]
The ""real"" answer to your question: You can't. You need to write your own. The Facebook Graph API (and most REST APIs) don't let you get that information out of Facebook. They let your code request it. So you need a web service to provide the information you want. A database is an obvious choice. But you could also use a NoSQL datastore.

The best solution I have come up with thus far is to have a fallback intent (which is triggered if none of the above three are triggered) with the same URI as the trigger, and to append the intent name to the URI, i.e., the app_intent://URI, so as to avoid the situation where all you have is a blank screen. This seems a little hacky.
Another solution is also possible, to make sure the only URI which is registered in the manifest is app:/// and app. Then when you receive the broadcast for your app and you are NOT on the right URI you can simply not do anything. But this also seems like a hack. So, my question is, how can I make this work as I intend? The app does register when launched for first time. It also shows the first splash screen when started. When launched with intent it shows a different splash. I would like to know if there is any good solution. The intent for the fall-back isnt_app://

474,why am i having trouble verifying my id?,"['verifying d', 'verifying d']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","or verifying a,b? The reason I ask is that in the first sentence, I am looking for confirmation of the fact that the user id ""123"" does not exist in DB, while in second and third, which have the same intent but different intents, there are chances that a user with id=123 exists in database and the intent behind is to confirm something with respect to it.
The above is a simple explanation. 
Let's imagine the scenario where the above utterances are used to ask for the availability of a product (id=1) and an attribute (name=red or blue) of that product in three different ways, as shown in Table 1 below. The table shows that there is no record (with product id = 1, name= blue and availability = 0) for an utterment containing the id 123, because no attribute of product 1 can be blue, and no blue product is available. Similarly, in case of id 1 and name red, we also have no records in table. But what if we were to verify the status of these products (availability of color = yes or no) as listed in Tables 1? In the table, the question with intent to check availability status will have id 4, whereas the other two questions will not have any such intent (therefore, they will be answered in a general manner). So, how can I find the right intent of question, given the situation described above?
Table 1:
Product (Table)   Available  ProductId  Color
  1  Yes  123  Blue  4

A:

  Why am I having difficulty verifying that I have an ID of 1234. (No such record)
Verifying D?  or  Verifying A, B? I guess you meant verifying D or A and B.

 The fact with the given utterence can not be verified because it says no such product exists. And also, what does verify mean, exactly? To verify something means to validate it, to make sure it was accurate. So if there's no product with that ID, then you're doing something wrong. If there wasn't no way of knowing this, you would not know if you had an id of 123 or not so there really is not anything to ""verify"" about that. This is where you can use a different"

If there is no way to know for sure what it is trying to ask, is there at least some chance of guessing that the intent might be ""log app""? Or would it be better to just ask the ""no intent"" case? If that is not the case, how can I get an answer to it?
To sum up: how do I know what to do in this situation? And should I do anything in particular if the answer is ""just no idea""?

A:
[edited after OP clarified that this is an intent that has a very specific meaning for my domain - that of using the user's credentials to log into the application]
You should just say: 
""No, I don't have the appropriate permissions, can you please grant it and then let's try the next time.""
The user will then go to their permissions panel and grant the login permission, and we'll get a log_in_success intent.
Now, the real answer here is: I think it's unlikely that you will get any specific intent because it doesn't fit the expected usage of your bot. If I wanted to login to my account, it'd be unlikely I'd use the chat as a prompt to start the bot, when I would expect to use it in a more traditional way."

How many intents would a user need to create or discover to cover all the possibilities?
I am trying my best to describe the user intent but if it's not clear enough feel free to ask. 

A:
If your application is to authenticate users, there is no need for user's to be able to say ""why can I not verify?"", because this is already a built-in feature in all modern systems. In this scenario, the action for them to take would be ""Verify my login name/password""
However, you may also have a scenario where you do want to give a response like ""Why can you not..."" and it depends on how you set up your system. For instance, suppose you are a website and some user sends you a post form with a bunch of stuff in it and you want a quick way to tell him whether you can even understand what he meant or whether he even did something right or not. If you have such a system, then the first action that you will need is not a ""verify"" action. Instead, it is ""Do I even accept this request from this user"" and the second action is either ""Reject"" or ""Accept"" because your response depends solely on what the actual content of the request is."

If the question has been answered before, I'd like to know that as well since I can only find the documentation and the official answers I've found here (and I know there has to be an answer to this question somewhere on the web, but I haven't found that so far).

A:
- I found a solution to my own problem, thanks to @nkamper.
I was not able to find a way to do it directly with a single intent or with the verification.unsubscribe intent (or even the general verify.verify intent) that were suggested by the lightning documentation, since these can throw exceptions (as pointed out in that answer I already linked). The intent that actually worked for me was a modified version, based on some code I read on github, that I modified and renamed to verifyId. The difference was to set the objectId instead of the accountId, which is fine for my case since the only object in my organization is user. I hope some of this code will be useful for someone else in case the standard ones won't work. Here's how I did it:  

  const verifyUserId = (component,event) => {
  let action = cmp.get('v.body').findText('action');

   if (event.data.actionName!='verification.cancel') {      try {       var verifyEvent = $A.util.buildEvent('listener', {type :'actionStarted'}, {event :event, actionName : 'id'});         verifyID.start(verififyEvent);     } catch(er) {      return"

Also there is no specific action taken on the part of the user: we just get a notice about an issue. So is this not really a request or an action? Maybe it should be a statement? 
Finally, when someone reports an identity verification issue, what kind of information should he (s?) give? (i.e., email address, IP address) is that necessary? Are all the details required to be in this specific format? Also, how to make sure he's using the app correctly? How does the backend determine if the email is an actual email or not? What's the expected behavior here? For example, does it send a ""thanks for reporting, you will be contacted by support for further info"" if it cannot verify your id? etc. etc
Please note that this is something I have no experience with, i've never worked in such a position, nor i'm familiar with the legal aspects of it, so any clarifications would be greatly appreciated

PS: I'm in Europe so the concept of ""verifying identity"" isn't really clear, but it would make sense to have it so that the question is applicable to any jurisdiction

To be more precise, my question really concerns the intent and how the conversation goes. I've heard people say ""I want to verify"" or ""i need to confirm"" as an indication that ""a specific request is being sent (or being about to)"" to the other side. While this may be true, are these actually all three possible intents? Or is it really that one is more appropriate and any two should suffice? If not (which I believe are not), does anyone know which one should i use, or is there any rule of thumb that can be applied here that I would not have to dig through a bunch of different sources to find out? I really want a single source with a solid reference to which can guide my choice without me needing to read multiple articles on which to base my answer

Asking about ""pin location"" sounds like we're asking if someone knows what the pin is.
This is not an error though, that's just what it sounds. For the most part, it does not matter what intent ""is this location for the X?"" will give you. If there is some ambiguity, we can always ask for some clarification, like ""do you mean the Y pin?""
I think in most cases, the right answer isn't going to depend on which intent you use. Instead, you are trying to figure out if the user knows how to use the tool. You are asking someone to perform a task. This task usually involves some action that is performed by the person with the answer to your question.

When we are looking for one of those, we look for ""new"" because the setting of a new PIN/chip will reset it. If the button was available, it is pressed.

487,is my card pin saved in the app,"['card pin', 'saved app']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","A:
... it's unclear what you're asking here.
I'll try answer in two parts: one on the question, and one answering the comment about the 'is this card saved?' thing. (In case someone else will have to explain it, I hope this will be enough. :))
What you describe
The app is a service that stores data about your cards. This could be anything you want it to: a PIN, a token (like a cookie), etc. In this case it is not saving any card data but it has some information about it. Your service can be a simple one. It could store the card's number, the token ID, whatever you like. And then you can send this as an intent to your app: intent { putExtra( ""card"", your_card_number_here);... }. But, that's not all. The card is saved if the service knows about that card. To check if your card has been saved you'll ask if that exists: if (service.getCards().contains(the_token_that_was_set_before_theintent)) {... card_has_been_saved...}.
If you do it this way, your service will not save the data itself but will only save information. You could create some sort of object with properties 'has card', 'number' and 'token', for example. Or you could even just put the info in some other format you think makes sense. Just remember to update all the places in your own code that might use that. I think that if you make your intent the way I described, you might end up doing it that way. Because that is how you should do this. That's how I would do, at least."
488,i don't know where to look to find my pin,"['find pin', 'find pin']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","Is there a preferred intent when someone says that they don’t know which of the available options to choose? 
How should an API respond to a situation like that? Do you just pick the ""best fitting"" intent from the given list of intents?

Also, when searching by using the int ""FindByTitle"" do we just assume that the search will be a ""title search""? Is it a better idea to provide additional parameters that let the consumer choose what type of search he/she wants? (In that case: What should be the response?)

The user doesn't want to give the number to an unknown party, so the only option available is to ""look up"" the phone number in an external database.

You should create an app intent with the name “newpin”. For your app, when the user says the word ‘pin' followed by a number, you should show the pin image for the given pin on the phone screen.
Here are some references."

Also, the speaker may or may not know for sure about the pin or the action of getting it."
492,do i need a pin,"['need pin', 'need pin']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","need to put on a poncho? do something with a knife?

I see that people have said that you need an if-then, however if there is an intent that covers the use of the knife with the ponce, then you are not saying an ""IF then"".
The closest I can see is intent for need pone, but this may be too general.
So you will most likely need the intent do (something for pin) (with a tool) - if the tool is a thing, or an activity, the if statement will not be required, and will be implied. 
Example:"

In the case of the latter two sentences, one might think that they are asking different questions. The latter sentence sounds like one where the speaker does not think they can find their PIN if they don't have their phone with them.
But then why does the former sentence work? My thought is that it is ambiguous and the first one is a ""best fitting"" interpretation. Is this correct and if so, what would the rules be for resolving this ambiguity? Would the two questions be the same or one the other or something else?

They all seem valid to some extent. I'm interested in the usage guidelines for such expressions. Are all three valid, or does my use case warrant some form of disambiguation? Or is it perhaps incorrect? 
As a related example, there are a few cases where, instead of asking what your card type is, you would ask what type of card something is.
Examples (from a real life conversation):   1a. what's your pin (i.e., what pin code is on the card you are holding up to the reader)?
  2a) what card do you have / do I have?"
495,and what about the card's pin?,[' pin'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","A:
The answer is ""no.""
You can see that on the left side are two slots, which you are filling with cards.  Each slot has a question mark.
On the right side is a button. It says ""pin."" 
There are no other options that would make sense on one of these cards, at least if the intent is to make a payment. Therefore, ""the card"" does not have a specific intent here. You can also see from the image that the button to the far right is greyed out. This means there is no intent to ""add a card to a wallet."" Because you don't see anything in the two other slots that are currently filled, the ""card"" also does nothing. No action is taken."
496,about this card pin?,"['card pin', ' pin']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","pin number card number? I believe only one of them makes logical sense.
The second half, about card/number, makes sense, but it is more of a description of the object, and is less about the card. For cards, you usually have a card reader (like a pin pad at the checkout) or some form of magnetic stripe. In the latter case, the magnetic card could be any card (credit cards are usually magnetic). For a number, it doesn't make sense to me as the number is usually some kind of code, for example for a credit card: CVV2. 
If the intent is that the person needs to be able to find out how much you owe by entering your pin, then I guess only pin does make logical, sense here, so I would just say that I do not know where the other card information would be on a PIN card, in such a case."

@mhj I'd argue that ""i haven't received a pin"" (intent 1) is much more useful for determining an application's functionality (i.e. ""I want to order something from the grocery store""). In contrast, asking ""what is my PIN?"" (which should be impossible to answer) would be too confusing (for your hypothetical user, anyway), and could easily mislead.

My first idea, of course, is that it is because I'm on iOS (the answer being ""because you are using iOS"").
Now, this answer would be true for any iOS device and not for the iPhone or Android. So I'd also like to check if it's the case of an Android phone or if iOS can handle it.
Also, what's about a native app? I am using an android app written with React Native to access the backend. Is it possible to do so also? If yes, then does it make sense? What about the user that will download it from the app store? Will they be able to use it? Does it even make a difference if you just ask for permission to the internet to read a pin, or to a particular service in the particular case that you have one? Are the permissions handled differently from device to device? Can one use an app from one device in another one (in my particular question, with react native)?
The point I want to address here is not to ask the question if and how can one access his account's details from native apps or web apps in a mobile device, but rather about if there would exist any technical reason (that's not just a matter of ""it just doesn't work"") to make it impossible. If it would make any sense to have that, I think that's what I have to consider. But I don't know the reason why it doesn'T work, and what would it mean to me. 
In summary, my question is: does there exist a technical limitation on how users can see their pin if they ask it via a web app, an email, in their native applications or even web or native application?"

Comment on the answer of ""Sarath"" : If I am correct, there are no such intent available to you. It should go with a ""have card"" and ""need pin"" intent (with a proper slot for slot).
Also, you can't expect a user to answer every possible question.
You'll have to take that as ""no"" to your particular question

Reply to Sasha ♀♦ (not available yet):
This is what I found in the UIMA documentation:
The intent is either: card-come, card-, pin-coming, pin-, card+, no-card+ or card-. The pin slot is a separate slot and the card intent slot may or may not be there depending on its position in that slot. The slot position may be determined using the slot-locations and slotType properties in conjunction with the value of a slotId property on a Slot or, for no slot intent slots, the absence of the Slot element with that id. For slot+ (and for slots) that are not slot+, it is determined in relation to the next slot element in a chain. When there is only one slot in an intent chain, then the result is slot+.
And here is an example of slot + intent with multiple slot elements: <slot slotNumber=""1"" slotLoc=""left""/> + <intent slot=""3"" type=""slot-with-a-slot"" /> and <span slotid=""4""><slot> is inside <intentslot>. This intent can then also be represented"

“Thank pin” is a common construction where one says “thank’s so much ‖ for doing X, and X happens to be something that involves a key. The speaker is grateful to have received a pin, but not to actually need one.
To ‘thank the card‘ is to say „Thank you [for the help]‚, meaning that the speaker received some help, or is very grateful that he did get help.  
The construction ”thank [the pin]/[the card] pin for...„ is possible if one uses a definite article with a noun of which the pronoun has been omitted. In other words: ‚thank pin (for...)‛  is acceptable. However, ’thank card(pin)... ‛ is not acceptable in my opinion.

Can someone give a simple example of ""pin or numeber"" in an intent or slot?  I would like examples with examples.
Is the ""location"" and ""my number"" an idiom? Why or why not? I'm curious to try to understand this phrase without the context of location. I hope there's a clear distinction between a location and an utterances location as the former is often used to mean ""the place of"" while the latter is used with locations. Is there an equivalent of  ""where is your number?"" (to which the answer is always located at or in my phone).
Thanks
EDIT: Clarification on the question: The question is not to ask what the word means for the person asking, but to see if we can learn about the meaning of an expression through our analysis of its parts. For example, ""what word is located in this sentence?"" Is the obvious choice, in which case ""located"" is a function word and has a very specific definition. The correct question that needs to be answered is ""What is an example or definition of 'locate'?"" So the example given by @JohnCole is incorrect and can be disregarded. Also, it should be noted that my question isn't asking for a definition, just an illustration of how that phrase is formed. A good explanation of definitions and their usage may be able to help. Thanks!
Edit: To be specific, an answer to ""Pin number location"" that I was looking for was one that included location with a pin, a number or something else entirely. That's all I wanted from anyone's answer, as it is clear that the original intent is to find something specific. Sorry for asking something different than what I intended. Again, the definition is irrelevant in the sense that it was not asked for in any way. My original question was whether ""locating"" a word or idom is actually about a noun or verb. There are examples of both (for example: ""He could not located it,"" ""You can't locate this,"")"

Bryan points out in a comment that it is not unusual for a question to have multiple correct answers depending only on context. My comment was just a reminder that if that's the issue with your question then I was trying to explain why the question was not well-formed. 
The problem with ""I cannot find the PIN"" is that there is no PIN to find. The PIN may be located in one room on your desk while you are looking in another. In most cases there are a dozen or so people in your home but if someone is in need of access to the door or to a car it makes sense to locate ""the"" PIN. However, this particular PIN has an infinite number of locations. If I put your card on my desk and give you the number, I could also put it in three other places: under the pillow, between my teeth and in front of my pants, and you could say you cannot ""find the"" card.

This is an issue for my application where if the user types something like, in a normal conversation with a friend: ""Hey, i want my phone"", it's a little weird to me.
I'm using the new Google Play Services v9 and don't see any way to do this, but is it possible? Or is this just a no. I have tried googling and am drawing a blank, so I thought I'd ask here.

UPDATE
After researching, it seems as though this isn't something that can be easily handled (or not handled at all). There is no way in the AndroidManifest to say ""This is not a valid action for Google Services"" as you could with the normal Android ""app.action"".
So, as I suspected, what is being returned is probably the closest I can get, given Google's lack of clarity on the question. The closest they give is a response like:
{
   ""intent"": ""ACTION_PICK""
}
What are people's thoughts on this? How can I handle this in an easy, efficient manner?
As a side note, we have a web site for our customers that they have to login to and I'm trying to add this into my app so the website is handled separately. Is this the same situation? Can an intent be created in Android to get around this situation or do I still need to go through a server? Thanks
The issue here is that the android website needs to verify that users are logged in before allowing them to access anything sensitive. If we handle the authentication as part of my service, users would always be logged into the service. But, since the web page uses a different session, the response will always have the token in it as well, and users might be able to bypass this if they are familiar with Android, etc. We want them logged on to the app only, not to both. Any thoughts as to how I could accomplish this with either Android or my own server(s)?

So if it's a general question about finding ""pins"" in an application, then ""where can I find pins"" is not a good intent because it doesn't have the same answer for each of these cases.
But if you ask ""Where can you go to buy pin badges?"" then the question could be a single answer in this case, depending on what you mean with the word pins."
511,when do i receive my pin,"['receive pin', 'receive pin']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","pin number?

The best way I can imagine this is via a separate intent of type receivePin with an array of the pin numbers, but then, how do you handle the situation if you get multiple pins? I mean that if, in your application, you would want to get only one pin, then you'd have to send multiple receivePins requests and ignore the results. That will of course lead to an unbalanced situation.
I have looked at this question, which seems to suggest that this scenario is possible, as far as I've read. But my question is, when you only want one, is there a way to do this in one API request? And how would you solve this situation? Or is it perhaps not possible because it's not mentioned in the documentation?  
Update:
There has been some confusion because I do not want a single pin; I want multiple (and of multiple kinds). I'm using the google home API, btw. Thanks for answering!  :D
(I just want my own code to work, no other applications to interact with)
Edit2: I just saw that someone posted code. I don't see how it works, though. So if someone could explain this to me (or point me at some documentation that explains it), that would really help me! Thanks again. :p

  {
""payload"":""You need to confirm your pin with your Assistant. ""

That code would be my input. If I were to have that on my app, I would call it like this: ""pin_intent"": ""receive pin"". But if I could get away with getting only ONE pin - in that case ""get pin1"" (the first pin), and not ""all pins"", I think it would work nicely.  Does something like that exist? Do I have any other options (I'm open to all suggestions)?
Thank you again for all the answers, and for any help!

512,help me find my card pin!,"['find pin', 'card pin', 'find pin']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","If a card PIN can be either a pin number (e.g. XXXX XXX XXX, where XXX are the last four digits in a credit card number) or an alphanumeric sequence that can change when the card is recharged, what is appropriate? 
For simplicity and to avoid ambiguity, let me assume the input to the algorithm will always be a numeric sequence (card PIN) that is always exactly 10 characters in length.
I would prefer to keep the scope of the intent as generic as possible. That means that the question should address both card pins and pin numbers. But I am open to solutions which require knowledge of any additional details about the problem, and I would hope that answers would also not assume such additional knowledge. I know, for example, that many cardholders will use a number of digits to represent the pin on their card. If the answer would have to be specific, I assume that a solution which uses cardholder's knowledge would be out of scope.  (E.G. ""What is your PIN?"" or ""I need your pin to recharge your card."")
Some of my own thoughts regarding this, which might or might not be useful for this question, are:
Card PINs are always 10 digits long, but pin codes may have anywhere from 4 to 12 digits. The number in use may change during the lifetime of a particular card, so for simplicity we are assuming a constant pin code throughout the lifespan of this card holder. Thus, a PIN is a 10-digit constant and a PIN is 10 alphabetic characters. However, an 8-character pin might have some characters common to both PIN and PINS, e.i., XXXYYYZZZZ. A PIM is 6 digits of alphas, XXXYZ, 6 alpha-numerical, YYYZ or something along those lines. This would not allow pin changing, only pin resetting. It would however, allow the use of XXX1Y and XXX2, with the alfas reset to one or two each time. Note that PIN-like and PIN are two different ways of using 10 alpha characters for something other than a password. While both are valid and acceptable, they have different meanings: with PIN, it is only the numeric part of your code that changes, while the PIX stays the same, regardless."

A:
The first of the four options you listed seems to be correct.  
If we were to add another example:  What does he/she/it do in this picture, is he delivering the pin or is she delivering it?  This doesn't seem to fit into the three examples that you provided. It seems more of an example and a question for an answer. If we remove delivered from the sentence, we should get a different meaning. For instance, the answer could be yes or no, or it could mean deliver or pin. In this sentence it probably means deliver."
514,i can not find my card pin,"['find pin', 'card pin', 'find pin']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","A:
It seems to me that this is a perfect instance of a ""redundant intent"".
Your first, and most likely intended, intent is: 
card_pin
   find card_number_or_password_to_authenticate
And this would match all your examples except: ""My card PIN is 1234 or 6789"" (the ""or"" is not redundant because it could be both 12 and 789.)
So, you could remove your last intent (card pin) because if this intent doesn't exist any more, then the user can't make the error. It doesn;t really make any sense to have this as its own intent. You can also remove ""can not"", because the meaning of this phrase is ""I cannot"" - the ""i"" would imply an ""are"" or ""is"" intent instead."

If we could find an intent that would get most questions closed, that's a good thing. However, I feel that the current intent ""do pin?"" is not well specified. That is, there are no good reasons why this intent should not exist. There is an obvious intent: ""What do you (I) need for an answer to be pinned?""
– Daniel R HicksJun 2 '15 at 8:31
Edit: to add clarity as the comment below mentions, i would also agree that there is no need at all to create an entirely new intent for pinned questions. This is because the existing intent is pretty good already - it just needs a more accurate tag.
However, the new tag ""Pinned"" does need a description, which is why i posted this question. I think it's clear how to use the tag and what it covers. If you disagree, please explain why. Also, this is about ""what is needed to make an existing question be treated differently to the same question posted later"". The description of the intent needs to match this. As it stands, it doesn't quite match (and that is my question).
What exactly do we do about questions that are already pinned? There are two possibilities: (a) leave them as-is or (b) unpin them. Option (B) is preferable (IMO) because it makes the site cleaner and doesn’t clutter old questions with the pin-flag. The question in my example is tagged ""pinned"", which would be redundant if we unpinn all questions tagged this way in the first place. So that part of my suggestion is to un-pin those questions automatically (when this proposal is in place, not now). If users don't want to unpine the questions, they can unmark them from the proposal. They will not be taken off the front page. (See the linked question for further details.) What this does is reduce the number of “pin-flags”. A pin should be used to mark an old question that needs updating or clarification. It seems counter-intuitive that an updated question would use a tag that means the opposite. An updated (or re-opened) question should use whatever tags apply to that question, whether those tags have been"

I've read the documentation but am still confused.
From: http://docs.intuit.com/solutions/data/integrate/cloud-platform-data-access-sap/guide/intro-sdk-architecture-and-design/section-intents: The intent can be defined by the developer through the SAP Cloud Data Access client. In this case, the intent definition should specify the resource type and the action. To determine what actions a resource supports and to define the correct intent for that resource, use the Resource Type and Object Name or Resource Key. For example, a “Customer” resource can include actions such as create, delete, read, and update. These actions correspond to specific intent definitions that you can assign to an Intent resource. The Intent object contains the type of request, action, object, method, data, or any other property to which an action is attached. You can create or delete the Intent by supplying the appropriate parameters. A sample Intent definition for a customer resource is:
""customerIntent"": {

The best answer would be intent that is not mentioned. In this situation, the intent is simply to find information, which is why the prepositional phrase can be dropped from the sentence.

(The other option, to a lesser extent, would be to ask for help from someone who has a residency visa - but this is a lot less relevant in the example, as it seems to require the agent to know about the person's residence status, and it's unlikely they do. And the question itself seems more likely to be phrased to help the OP with their situation, rather than asking for visa advice, which I think may be more common.)

If the answer to these questions is that they can't tell, it may well be that there's no one best fit. But I'd be interested in what the community thinks. I feel that we've already determined the general intent (it's to change a circumstance, for example because it means that the speaker doesn't have a job in that country) - it should be possible, though not trivial, given the information you've given (you've said that you're a Canadian citizen, have the right documents, don't want to spend money), to determine with some certainty (or near certainty) whether it will be allowed and, in any case, whether you'll need the extra visa (the answer for the latter is probably no, but that doesn´t change the fact that a second visa application is involved).

I think a more appropriate question would be:
“What is our process of using your credit cards to make a purchase‘. Or: “Which is my best suited Intents for this„
The answer to the latter question is that you must go in context to your business model. If you have many people using their creditcard to perform purchases in your system you might want to build a system to detect that (I guess you could add some Intent detection to that, but that would likely require a lot of work).

If there's a way to find that out with Natural Language Processing, that would be awesome.
Thanks
P.S. I'm not looking specifically at English. Just wondering whether there are methods for finding the right intent in many languages. 
EDIT: To make it clear: I don't want to just use any tool, because I want it to be able to handle a large variety of languages including Russian, Chinese and Arabic. Not just English, I also want my system to work in those languages
Also, it's important that I find out the correct intent using an automated way of doing so, rather than going through hand written code. Because the intent could be ""change password"", ""send message"", etc. And I'll definitely want that to happen with an NLP system. That said, my question is about the use of Natural language processing in the task of intent identification. Also, this isn't to make up rules. This is to build a system that helps my users to do stuff. So this system is not supposed to tell me ""I don’t know, but it appears you meant to ask the second option"". Instead, the system can do that. If I ask for some intent then the rules should tell us which intent is appropriate. We'll use the appropriate intent to guide us in our work of building the application/system. For example, to change password you would ask: How do I change my password? This should guide our system in creating a method to perform that action, which can be called when the user invokes changePassword
Now I might get a lot of different results. Like ""how do we change our password?"" and the results can even depend on the language: in Russian it could give the answer like ""You can”t do it in English because in that sentence the ""to"" verb is transitive. But in German it might say ""How do you change the password if you can't do so yourself""
So I guess I am still looking for a general way that does not depend specifically on English/German/Russian/Spanish etc., but on finding this out from any given language. Maybe there already is a rule that says something like: the verb in question needs to end with the preposition ""for"". If that is true then it works regardless of the given input, regardless on"

I guess one could ask ""what's better"", but really it depends on what you need. For example, ""show"" may be a valid action, even if the action has no effect, just like the ""play"" action on a radio with no radio. But a ""change"" request might have effect on the object, making it different. A ""set"" would normally mean the same thing as ""store"" (which means you can't change it later, only set it, but you also cannot do ""unset"").
But this is a very open ended answer. I would recommend you look into this at a higher level. The ""how to"" answer you seek is too big for this forum. You need to find a book that deals with this. In general terms, an intent is an intention of a user to cause an action. State is what a particular object has - that's a little different from an ""intent"" but in essence it is also a kind of plan. To me, at least. It's how you want to interpret the user input and react to it. One could say ""there are no intents"", only state, and that would be true. Or you could take the view that it can be anything the program decides to do, based on user intention. That's also true, except it might not be what the author of the code intended - and therefore it will be ""buggy"".
So I guess you're best off using ""state"". And maybe a few other keywords. Maybe a list of ""expected"" actions and states, so you know what things to expect when you do something. And, again, this isn't really programming advice. This is just ""useful"". :)
Best of luck. Hope that helps. (Oh, btw, you should always use the 'intent' of an object and not the intent of some action you take. There are so"
532,how can i top up?,['top '],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","Given the utterance: how can i top up?. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: top? topup?? top-up?

How can we best identify the intents of utterances in a dialogue system? This is a classic and longstanding problem to which there is now a lot of interest. A good review of this topic was recently provided by.
The main problem with the current approaches is that they do not take into account all the words in the sentence and they don’t distinguish the various intensions. One approach that has been suggested is to consider each word of the question as an argument, and then to use a Bayesian inference approach to estimate the probability that the answer to the overall question is top, top -up, top_up or not a match for any of these. This idea can be easily implemented, as shown in by, but is limited to those utterables whose words correspond to arguments; if the word has multiple meanings, a question like “How does i get to town?” (i.e, with a verb as a noun) does not make sense.
In this post we present a method of solving the intent identification problem, using semantic parsing and natural language processing. The method relies on a graph-based representation of questions which allows the use of a general semantic parser. We show that such a representation can indeed be used to solve a number of different question answering tasks. In addition, we show how such methods can make use the rich body of knowledge available in Wikipedia, allowing us to provide a unified semantic framework for question and information retrieval tasks, which are traditionally performed using very different methods."
533,i am missing some funds from my account - i tried to transfer them using my credit card number and it disappeared,"['using number', 'card number', 'disappeared number']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","Given: I want to go there.
To: There
Precondition: there is someplace I'm planning to visit
Intent: visit place
Action: go
Result: went
I am assuming that, since the goal can be accomplished with an action that has a result, then the correct answer for this scenario is Intent. Am I right? 
If that assumption is correct, I am not sure about the second scenario. If you go, to the store, and buy a bottle of wine, would it still be an Intention? Or would the result not be ""bottle bought"", but ""I went, because I bought a wine""?
Thank you for any clarification!
Sofia
EDIT:
As far as I understand the ""To"" verb, it can't be used to express a goal or a purpose - it only refers the person performing it (who may not know the intended recipient). But, for example, the precondition can express the purpose or goal that a person wants to achieve through the action. So, in my case above, a prepositional phrase would be more appropriate - I have a place that I wish to get into, so if I say: ""go there, i have some money i want you to bring me from there"" then it would make sense. But what would happen if ""There"" was the destination? I would say, ""Go there!""
Would my understanding of the verb correctly describe the scenario? Is there a better term I should use, such as a ""target""? I can imagine that being better than simply ""place""
Thanks!   Sofia. _________________
Edit 2:  I was also wondering about ""intentions"". If I go to a grocery store and say ""buy tomatoes"" what is my intention? Would the word ""to"" in that case be appropriate (like if they were the target)? Or should I use an ""action"" (buy) and a different ""result"" such ""got"" or ""picked""?

The best fit would be topUpAccountWithMoney. I think there are three different ways to express the same fact.
I'd also argue for top_up_account, as well: it is short and sounds like an English word.

The next step is to set up your debit account with the same financial institution that your credit account is with. Your current checking or savings account might be a viable choice for a first time debit transaction. Some accounts have the option to add additional debit accounts as well. When you go to make a purchase, you use your card number just like a regular credit or debit purchase. But the account that you used for authorization must be associated with a checking balance. For security, we do not allow debit transactions unless you are a customer of the bank or if your account has sufficient funds. Debit payments are often made from a different bank account than that for which credit payments have been made. It is common for companies using online payments to allow you to"

1. I did topupto see that my amount still did not show up on my phone
2. My balance did decrease, since top upto says your balance is at xxx
3. Topup for me did nothing, and my balances is still at the same amount it was, even though I had a transaction for it
4. This was my actual intention (see my last transaction), but I was confused by this because the ""i am waiting"" text is in the message body and the word ""waiting"" is not present in this sentence
5. See wallet: is my current intent
6. It's my understanding that ""Wallet"" refers to the wallet application itself, not the transaction history for transactions. Am I getting this right?
7. Do I need both intent ""see wallet"" and ""view transactions""?
8. If I do need those two intents, is it ""topuptowatchwallet"" or ""transactionsviewtopup""? I tried ""View my top ups"", but it said it's not defined

11. Can anyone else verify the last question, about the order of intensions? My wife has had some issues with top Ups in her other phone, so I thought of a new problem. But maybe I am wrong.

The question seems, and I'm sorry to say, somewhat unanswerable. Let me elaborate. I know that you're not interested in what I believe the intention might be (which isn’t relevant, because you need an intent for natural language generation anyway), but I hope I could explain why the intended solution is not very useful in practice. If the only intent that is relevant to you is ""right info received balance"", this intent will only be useful during one situation: when the balance should be updated by another person. It's quite unlikely your users are so used to the way you work, or so knowledgeable, that they will know this kind of scenario and will enter the correct information in the first place, just to let the app know their correct balance afterwards.

i think top is used to describe a state, e.g. ""i'll top this off"" meaning ""to fill""
if it is a noun, it would be ""we topped off the oil tank"".
""Top off your account"" would only be used if the speaker has some understanding of what an ""account"" is, but it might make them think he or she is trying to say ""top off of your card"". ""I topped the gas tank"" means i filled it up to the max, ""the gas"" was already in the tank. i topped it (of course), now it's ""full"". i'm not sure what you mean by 'account', though. is it a card, the balance on an online banking site? I think that if a friend were to ask ""How much will you topoff my bank account?"" you might be in trouble
in any event, i don't think ""will my buddy be at-pon my credit card account this week"" makes any sense at all. the phrase would normally be: ""my buddy will top (fill) my gas card"" or ""his credit will increase this month by the amount of my next gas purchase"" -- if my ""gas card was filled"" on monday i'll ""be in at the cash register on thursday with the $10 i get for refilling"". I'm thinking about this because in a few weeks i need to ""buy some gas for my vehicle"" and if i ""don't top"" my existing gas, then my tank will ""run out"". it will still be safe to drive, and i can buy gas ""at the pump"". but ""when i go to buy some more"" i might only ""fill (refill)"" what I have, to see if it costs ""as much as I thought"" because that is what a ""truck would charge me"". maybe ""he'll be out"

What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","(Note that this is a question of what the most suitable answer would be, not a statement about what people actually use, etc.).

A:
As a native speaker, I would say all of them would mean the same thing, except that transfer is not used as a preposition in this context, but the verb. 
In order to distinguish between them, you would need to provide context in which one would have more than another. However, since they are all acceptable words you could use here you wouldn't necessarily want to focus on which is more or less correct.
However, transfer would not imply the use of a card, or even the concept of card at all. I'd also think of transfer as more of an abstract concept, while the other two are clearly specific to financial transactions."

use card (to) top-up
i tried using my (card) to...

My reasoning is that, even though'my money' is in the nominative case, and 'to my...' are in nominally ditransitive constructions, I do not think it is necessary to change the structure of your sentence in order to make it a nom. trans. clause. (I'd just say that 'disappeared' can take the place of a noun phrase, but maybe I misunderstand the question.)

Have
you read your statement lately? If not, you will likely be stunned at the interest that you may have to pay. That's why you should consider the use of a good credit monitoring service. This type of service will allow you to keep your monthly bills on your computer. In essence, it's like having a virtual monthly statement. It's important that every bill is paid on time so that there aren't any late fees added to your account balance. When you get a free credit alert, that's a tip-off that your credit has been monitored. The credit report on you.com is an online system that offers a wealth of information about your financial health. You will be able to see your balance, outstanding amount, payment history, history and more, all at a quick glance. And if there are no derogatory remarks about you made to any of the credit reporting agencies, there will probably be a note about how much interest you are charged each year. By getting more information, and by paying your bills, your score is improved. Pay Your Bills On-time!
I know there's nothing you could or would do differently, but when it comes to credit cards you can't afford to be late with paying them back! I've heard it said, ""The best way to build credit is through a well managed balance on a low rate card"". This doesn't mean, of course, to carry a high balance of $1000 or more! You have a responsibility to always pay your bill"

Are both forms correct? Is there a difference between them? Are both accepted by most people? What are some other alternatives for the second case? For example, should it be: How do I add some money?

The first one is better - that is because it is closer to the ""verb form"".

It doesn't necessarily need to be a money thing you can do it just a lot of other ways. A person could say ""Can I get another account on that server?""

For now, the only way I've found to solve the problem is via intent filters, as per Android Intent Filters:
<receiver android:name=""com.mypackage.util.IntentReciever"">
   <intent-filter

android:priority=""1000"">  // highest priority
</intent>
....
..
.
 </intent_filter> 

 In fact, when I use the intent filter, my app never fails to get top and top level intents.  However, this doesn't feel right and seems to be breaking some of the intensions in the code. I would prefer having the action in place, and if a specific action is not defined, then use another intent of another nature. Is there anyway to accomplish this? (besides the obvious: not use actions).
Thank you for all your help!
EDIT: Just to clarify some more, I'm using a custom broadcast action, not an action like ACTION_POWER_CONNECTED
UPDATE: I have tested this solution (using only one intent and adding an intent-filters to the top-intent). This seems like the right approach, since if you do not specify a <extra> in your intent it will be ignored by Android. However this seems as a somewhat hackish, to say the least, approach. If there is a better way to do this, please let me know! (and I'll vote up your answer, of course :)
So my question is now: can I declare more than one action that I expect from Android, but only use one (or one more if they specify one of those actions), while still using an Intent.ACTION in my code? I mean, will the system pick the first one it encounters, or will it just pick one arbitrarily among many, while ignoring the rest?

I don’t agree with @matt-g who answered that “the best-fitting intents are both add accounts”. If the user said ”add money“, then both interentents will fire.
If, in fact, the „add accounts, money, transfer„ is better than ‚add funds‘ – then you might ask, does ‘add‚ in ’add account‟ have an argument place or is it used for disambiguation? Does ‒add, add, accounts; money;transfer′ have different meanings? Or does the dispreference come from not allowing more than one intent per uttering? – That would have to be the question. In other words: you are trying to decide what‧s worse. You could, however, just use the negation, for example ′are my accounts able add more funds?‛
‒ ‑Are my‹ friends› able †to add‡ funds† to the‬ account I ‐am using․‖

A:
[...]
I can think of the first three as all being ""top of"", and the fourth as ""topping up."" All of these could be understood as being equivalent: all imply that you're topping up to a particular level.
But of your four, the one that means ""getting the money from your bank"" is ""up"" to the ""highest account"" you can have at a bank. So you may be able to use ""of"" in this phrase, but I'd recommend against it: it isn't idiomatic, unless you know the context of a given phrase is being used metaphorically, i.e. you've got a specific person in mind that the bank account is supposed to be ""referring to.""
So, I would say ""You can't top my bank up account."""
551,why is my money gone right when i attempted to top up,['top money'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","I don’t have any cash. I have money in an electronic account.

The problem, however, is that a statement can be true and there can still be some disagreement over what the speaker actually meant. It might be that the first two speakers were discussing their money. Or it might just be a figure of speech. There can even be an implicit “I”, as in ”…but I do have an account with that bank that holds money“. The speaker might then go on to explain in which account the money is stored, or perhaps they are referring to their bank account, with no implication that they can access any of the funds. But if we are to interpret this in context, we need to infer what ’we‘ are, and it is possible that there is at least some implicit reference to ‘I,‖ who can only be this specific speaker. So it could have been that ‹I „have money that I can‛ or I‰ have some money ‛that I cannot use ‚. Perhaps this statement is true, even though the actual speaker cannot claim to have the resources needed to make such a claim. And that statement could be false, depending on the amount of context necessary to figure out which speaker the statement belongs to.


For example, in the case of a simple question: What was your salary? we might want to know that someone is talking about their paycheck, salary, money they got, etc. Yet, it‟s possible someone might not know their salary and we could ask, ›What were you paid last month?‹, which could also be taken to be referring either to how much cash they have or to the fact they were not paid. In fact, that last sentence might have a more obvious intent. If someone says, ―Why is your money missing right? ‖ it doesn‚t mean they necessarily believe that their account has been drained, but rather that whoever stole it didn„t pay the bill, i.e. that is why it disappeared when it should have still existed. This might sound crazy, yet it happens all the time. ‬
In other situations, the situation can become more complicated. For example: ‰Why didn´t you come to class yesterday?´"

The correct intent is `topupAccount` in this case, because the `user` is talking to the bank, whereas the other utterances could equally be interpreted in context as the friend.

**Figure 1.16** Example of a top-down model's prediction
  |  **Figure 2.1**  A bottom-up model in the form of three separate models, including `intent`, `category` and `utterance`
As in Figure 1-2, the example is of an utteration: `What's the current balance of my bank account`  In this scenario, it is a `check balance` command. The first model, labeled `Utterance Intents` represents the output of the intent model for the entire utterence (including intents). The second model represents one of four possible category models for each intent. In the above example, there are no intants for `balance`, so `Category Intent` outputs the most likely category, which for this example should be `CheckBalance` (see Figure 2-1). Finally, this value is provided as input to `User Intant`, which outputs a value corresponding to which intant (intent) was intended.  This intent value then flows through `Text`, and is returned to us. Here, we see that the predicted intent for our uttererence is to check our bank balance, with an 80 percent probability. Note, in some cases, some intars may output the same category as others. For example:

  * `Balance`, in response to a question about our current account balance may predict the category `AccountInfo`. However, `GetCurrentAccountBalanceIntent`, as a response, may be predicted as `AmountBalance`.

_Intents are often ambiguous, especially in more complex scenarios, where an intent may have several different meanings_ _._  _An intent_ ,  `(Get current bank info)` _may be_, `1: current_ | _account_|_ or _(to get)_ `2: total balance_

The best fit is probably ""money"" since I imagine that there is some form of money that a user can spend in a game, but that it's not really money in the classical sense of being an accepted form on society (for instance, not the US dollar) and not having a real life counterpart. However I have no idea if a ""virtual money"" really exists, and if it does, what would happen with it after a transaction. I would guess the currency is converted into credits (a ""credit"" being a reward the player received in exchange for playing the game), but this still raises the obvious question of who gives the credit to the user? Is there a bank in virtual world that gives them credits as money for virtual services, or something similar? And why would I need something like that? I don't have the real money to begin with...

The fact that you are asking a specific question about what the ""best"" intent is indicates to me that your answer is that there is no best intent because it is a matter of preference and there isn't any real ""right or wrong"" answer.
However, I'd like to suggest that the answer you seek can be found by observing the context of the conversation in which you're speaking. You can then make an informed decision about whether it's best to use the past tense to describe a hypothetical situation, or if you want to say that someone has been making use of your card or debit card, etc. (The context will tell you, for example, whether ""they make"" or ""make"" is more appropriate).
In a business context, the most common scenario in my experience where the word ""might"" appears (in the present tense) is when discussing potential problems that a customer may have experienced. When someone tells you ""there was a problem with my order, and I'm still not receiving my package,"" they're typically saying ""My package was not delivered"" (because they were not able to get home in time to receive the item, perhaps). You're not asking ""Did someone do something with your package?"" but the more common usage is ""Are you saying that my packages weren't delivered?"".
""It's possible"" indicates two possibilities, ""it's probable"", ""someone else might have done it."". The ""may be"" implies someone may or may not be the one responsible. While you might choose to not use this tense for the reasons already presented, in the case of a potential problem, you typically should say something along the lines of ""You might want/need to send that order again. I'll be right back."" or something like that. If you use other verbs in this way, it can help your listeners to understand that it was your mistake and not theirs. This is just an example of how"

What is “best” or ‘correct’ in context, or for that matter, at all? –
This is not an easy question to answer and as usual, context is everything and there are numerous situations in which the answer can take various forms. The main thing I would like to mention is that ”correctness“ of a sentence may change according to whether the sentence is used to talk about past (in ’s‘, „ich werde gehen„) or future (‚ich gehe wohl‟,‌ ‚Ich kenne dieses Wort‰) actions, as well as the context of the statement is. A sentence like ‒‹Someone stole my password› can mean many things depending on the situation.

If someone tries to use your account, what is going on and does that person have the permission to do that? You should have an eye on your privacy and security settings and the person should be aware of your settings. Also if he/she has your profile, he is/can be able to change the background and pictures with the help of this profile. In this case I think that using the profile would be a better intent than using your own account as that can have various possible meanings too. It can also mean that someone uses your phone and is accessing your email or phone-number or whatever he has got access to and has done that before. Or you can say, that there is a new comment/question on that profile page. I have seen people get in trouble because there was no privacy settings on their page, so some other person had access and posted something. That is why I suggest that if it is possible (as you know better yourself) that you look over the Privacy settings of any kind of account or profile of yours. If I had to pick my intent based on all this, then I probably would go with changing profile (not the content or something). It is also possible that what has happened is someone has been hacked and used that information, but that is different question and would need more details."

J.W.Mar 21 '13 at 0:36
it will never be a problem (but will require lots of human training). if this were the only problem, we could just have human users classify things as ""use permission"", and have the card processor ignore that. the problem is that we have lots and lots more examples of people using a card for something they didn't have permission for (that card).
the question really is, ""how many negative examples is enough negative training data to make this work with a ML algorithm?""
(i am not an expert in this field by any means. i know a smidgen. but what i've read says ""a lot"", i.e. ""at least hundreds of thousands of data points""
in the end, i believe it's just a lot of work. we've all been burned by AI already. just make sure you understand why it works and don’t fall for it)
so what's a big company like amazon going to do to train this thing without the permission stuff? do they just collect a large number of examples like ""someone used the amz.com website when they weren't even allowed to by their boss, and then use that? does this amzn.co.uk thing have its own permission/permisson system? what the hell? i have a few questions here...

My card (was) taken (by) an unknown person (without) my (permission).  

                The answer:  No intent at at least three of the five.

                                 
Note that there are two different ways to describe (1).   This could be a bit complicated, but I hope it will simplify the analysis. 
 
Intent can, I believe, be expressed with the following four terms:

I have a feeling I want:   	I am	     I  was

I think it might be better to have your credit card company handle that.
The idea was that if your identity was stolen for whatever reason, your card would be useless without some sort of protection. I am in the banking industry so I was aware of this but it's still really useful, though I think there are better ways of protecting your account from fraud if it is already stolen. If you don't do any banking with this credit union, then perhaps they don'
t have any interest in protecting you. The same goes for any kind of fraud. You need to be aware that there is an inherent risk that comes with it, and there's nothing that can guarantee that you won't lose some of your money. With most major credit cards, it takes a very long time to activate the freeze on the card. So even if the bank says it was de
filed when you asked for it to happen, you still can't use the money for at least a full 6 month period without a time consuming (if not impossible) process. That's why I don
't advise freezing your debit card, because it can be quickly spent and then it would require you to contact the company and have them fix it...
—
Edit: I'm aware there may be a service that does not require contacting them. My point was the time it usually takes for them to react is far too long for the situation at hand. Also I do know that most companies that I have encountered will have a different response time when th
e freeze is put in place and when it comes off... but again, I would have to do a lot more research to prove this. But I've seen it work both ways. Either way, there might or might not be an activation process depending on your financial institution. (which you haven't specified in your question, even in chat)

Freeze is only used to prevent someone from changing the password. It will not stop the hacker/thief from having access. The only way to stop them from accessing your account is to reset the new password you have chosen. Once you reset it, they will no longer be able to access the accont, unless the computer they used has been compromised, then you would need to reinstall your operating system.
There is also the option that you can disable the ability to change passwords, but I don’t believe that to be possible. Hope this is of help!

It is not clear though, whether the OP wants to stop someone from doing it, or stop what they've already started. 
Is there any difference at all between these two options in a formal sense? Do they convey the same meaning, just in different forms?   For example in ""freeze it"", can we say what this freezing entails? Is it merely stopping or halting? And in what senses can both ""stop"" and ""halt"" be used to refer to stopping someone/something from continuing (which is why we use ""inhibit"" here?)
Thank you for bearing with my question, I just started to wonder a little, as I've always been a bit wary of ""filling in"" the blanks in questions.

Edit: A further thought: I could say ""Please unfreeze my shop"". But I wonder whether ""my shop"" implies that I own it? Can this be implied in such a phrase? Or are you saying that if someone else is doing the shopping, you would say freeze theirs? I suppose, this is similar to your example of a person's account, where the person doing online banking is presumably the owner, and the account is just being used. So in this way, the ""owner"" of whatever is being frozen is implied? However you can certainly use it to just refer that someone's doing is frozen. And so it is in that second scenario, that this question is asked in regards of. The person has frozen a shop, so how do we know if they're ""doing/owning it or using it""?

In English, ""stop"" usually means ""to end"" or ""finish,"" like when you stop a train. I would think that most people mean it to mean ""end"" and ""not"" rather than ""don't"" in other words.  For a bank, it would be important to know that the intent is ""I want to end the fraud"". If this is not enough information, or the user might want ""just don't let it happen"" then you'd have to ask for more information. It's better to say ""If you have an emergency, call this telephone number"", rather that ""Call this number if you want fraud to stop right away"".
""Account"" also usually has a negative connotation, so ""Account fraud"" might be more appropriate than just ""Fraud"". ""Stop"" is a verb, while ""account"" can be a noun. So, I think the sentence should say: ""How do I stop my fraud from happening?""
If there is any ambiguity in the question, then it should probably be split. ""Can I prevent fraud by contacting customer service?"" is fine, but then, you need to be specific. If the answer is yes, how? ""What is your phone number?"" or something like that?"

patches,
I would say that ""i think"" is not enough to determine what intent is behind the use of such a statement.
""i like cheese"" might mean that you want some cheese; it might also mean you don't like your current cheese. But we can still assume a positive intent behind those words. We can even say ""You don´t want any cheese?"".
But ""if i had a brain i wouldn't..."" can certainly be positive or negative. In either case the speaker has a certain opinion on the subject. If he says it positively, that might suggest that he likes his current brain. And vice versa. The speaker can be quite positive about what he considers his identity is and at the same time quite negative about his brain (the brain was too slow, had too few neurons...). He can say, ""I donʼt really mind if my brain is stolen because I will use the parts that are left over to make cheese"".
We do know that the word ""id"" means ""identity"". And ""stol"" can indeed mean ""take"". So the question about whether we should interpret ""my identity was stolen"" as if it meant ""you took my cheese from me"" or rather if ""your stealing my ID"" was meant, should be answered by the context. This should not be about ""checking"", it should rather be something that is part of the normal course of business, something an accountant might do, or something one might call a lawyer, a police, etc. etc., because it involves an interaction with other people, who have their own opinions and intentions, and who might have stolen some part or the other of one's identity. It is a normal process that people in the financial world call ""credit"" and ""debit"" checks, for example. To ""check for"" such things in any other way is strange, as I am not aware of a similar normal meaning and usage for that. So I would argue that one is in fact checking for ""unauthorized charges in this account"" not for, I don' know, identity theft, which would be the thing that my ""brain"" has stolen. (I know the brain part is kind of redundant, but in case"

5. To be used in situations where there is no crime but there may be a breach of trust with financial institution (i.e., an account balance has changed without authorization).

I am using the Stanford NLP package to classify intent in a sentence. The intent will have different classes for different utterances. My understanding is if the classifier is 100% correct then the sentence is ""can you"" and the user will be able to take some action. If it is only 90% then it can only be ""yes"", if it only 80% it could be anything: it may even be the wrong word. This has not been confirmed and there appears to be no research on this, however, as stated above - the ""how"" is irrelevant here. So far I have had no issue with using an 80-100% confidence for ""Yes"" or for no answer. It would be good to use a 100-0% as the end result (and possibly the middle result), but I am not looking for the exact result in this situation, just a high confidence value. 
Can somebody confirm whether or not this method would work?  If not, what are the reasons? Is it possible to get a list of words or phrases that are 100%, or 80%, for each intent to help with the training process? Any help would greatly be appreciated. Thanks. Also, any good resources or suggestions on training the NER models would also be very useful for this application. Thank you.

This question shows the need for a general purpose lexicon of the words and phrases in the English language. The purpose for this glossary should be to provide the correct and consistent meaning for the key terms in common use.
A general understanding of these terms will help anyone who wants to communicate in English, whether they be ESL learners, English learners of native English speakers, or English speaking learners from a different language background. (And it helps those of us who are non-native speakers of any other language as well!)
Please keep in mind that a ""glossary"" is not the same thing as an encyclopedia. A glossar is a small dictionary. An encyclopedia is more comprehensive and usually covers topics such as history, politics, and science. As such, the glossaries in these collections will be focused on the terminology and language used in everyday life. We are not going to spend time writing about the origin of words in any given language, for instance. If that is of interest to you, then take a look at Wikipedia.com. They have a huge online encyclopedia for any language there is!
For the non English speaker, you can get a free, but somewhat limited, glossa of Spanish. I would recommend checking Wikipedia out for that language too: you get some nice examples of usage in there too. For other languages, check your favorite reference book. There you should find a reference list of your own language (if it is one you are interested in learning) with all its words. That's how I learnt English from the beginning (I started at 3 years old).
To begin with, please look up the meanings of some of those terms. It's better to be sure you understand the terms first. Don't worry if you do not know all the technical details behind some terms yet. In some cases you will discover there are several terms that mean the very same, so we will discuss them when we get to them. You can always come back and re-read them if there's something you don't understand. When you have looked up a few different definitions, we can move on to discussing what it means to freeze your account, etc. Also, there may be some words that have multiple meanings or different uses. This is because people sometimes use terms interchangeably, without knowing what they are talking"

I am not 100% sure, but i am guessing the intent is not: not to use the card/i don't want to be identified as using the cards. Is this correct, or is it not clear at all what the intents are?
My guess is: use card is just a general action, and not about the user (i) using his/her card or (ii) the action being performed (in my use case, the i will use is implied).
Thanks :)
Note:
If someone can give it a quick +1, that will help me to know. I am sure someone will do so, since it is a common question in a few different threads on the forum, as per the title. :)

The first intent in the example is actually using a card! And the second one doesn't seem to make much sense, in my point of view. But thanks to those who made the right guess.  :D
Edit: I have accepted the correct answer, even though it isn't a 100%, because it was the most voted one. Thanks to the guys that helped me. : D
Also, I think it should be noted that the first and last intensions can be interchanged: i don’t think “this is an other card” is wrong, is right, at least in context, however, you are using two cards, so that is why my answer wasn‘t 100%. :) : )
Last, to answer to comments: ‘I want“ means ”I don,t care about that‮. In my example this was an example where the person was using several cards in one transaction (like the examples given in some comments). In the same transaction the other user could also be performing multiple transactions with cards on her/his card(cards).  If I say  „i would say to my friend i want him to not be able to identify me‬, this means I do not care if he does not identify him/me, instead of saying:  i wouldn‚t like him identify you"

You should have a good intent. I'm assuming it's something like ""I need to check out my charge card"" or ""Someone stole my credit card number"".
It's not clear what you are trying to verify - the card itself is stolen? Or, the account information is in the hands of some bad guy? Are they both the same? You need a more specific question before we can come to any conclusions. Also, I'd probably add a ""how"" component to your questions. For example, ""How do I know that my bank account is not hacked or my debit card was used to purchase $2 of goods?""
If you're sure you have an Intent, then your question would be more along the lines of ""Which Intent should I use?"".
As a side note - ""using payment cards or debit cards for purchases?"" - this isn't a valid intent; it doesn't specify any action you'd like to perform with the payment information, it just says you want to use a payment method. This might actually be a duplicate of the original question."

A:
[1] do not do card transaction.
I think the first two intent is incorrect, since the transaction was done successfully and there is no information about your card information. In this case, the sentence is a negation sentence and ""Not"" means ""not do"". The negated action is that ""someone used your information.""
However, there should not be such negator in natural language. So we need to re-phrase it. A natural way is to say, ""i think somebody used my details"".
""Do not (use card) details"" is more related to action, and can be rewritten as follow:

I'd argue no. Why?
Well, it doesn't make sense to say someone used your card, but it makes sense, in some cases, to use someone's card - for example: If you ask a friend of yours: Do you have my car keys?, they can say: No, I don't! and you can ask: Have you used the keys yet? and they might reply (even though they don´t actually have the car) : Yes I have. And the fact the card has become a vehicle for communicating intent doesn´r mean that if you say you've used a person's key card it has the same semantic content as ""used car key"". In fact, ""I've got your key-card"" would be a better example. So we can safely conclude that the ""use card"" utterances are not an attempt to express the idea of ""card"".
Another example that I find somewhat convincing is that ""you can use"" is an example of a non-finite verb.  
As you said, there is no verb for ""to use a verb"" - the way we do in English, and in most dialects of Spanish, for instance. I think a correct way to make the case for the existence of such a construct might be to point to the use of the so called ""faux pas"" construct, that is:
  to have said something wrong or foolish in a way that cannot easily be corrected (a mistake)
You might try to think up a use case in which that construct does not make perfect sense: for someone to try and correct another person´s mistake. In that context, the faux pas construct doesn�t sound out of place at all, given its semantics."

The first intent is 'Get new credit card' as in 'I'd like to order the new Visa'.
But also there is another intent that is not mentioned by OP and this other intent can be the same as his first but the difference is that if OP doesn't get his card he can ask again by using the word (new) and get the card info. Therefore there could be a second intent of saying that I have the data that was in card but now I need to use it, so I can say 'If i don't feel that i have it... I don’t have that. I'll have to get another card.'
If he doesn‘t like the first sentence, but he prefers this one, he shouldn't ask the original question again but ask instead if he has the credit info (if he didn't have, then he got a better credit information)
To be clear: I think OP's sentence is fine because the intent in each version of the story is clear. The real question is what does the second version have as the'real' intent. And I'm pretty sure there's only one answer to this. But it's an interesting problem. :)
And there seems to be some misunderstanding in your interpretation of my sentence
'The second is to say the OP can get an information that already exists, i.e. a card, with an existing number, by saying ""If I feel i know the number and have used it recently, can I get it?'. The first part of your quoted sentence states that OP should have some information about the existing card number. So your sentence does not say that there can exist a sentence that says 'i have information for a number that does NOT exist'
What you are trying to do is actually quite hard to express in natural language."

How much are you going to use? A card is only good enough for $200 a month max before it needs to come back from the merchant, so they would need to spend $1,000 a year or more on your card, which is a lot of $10 per day purchases. If you go over the limit, it gets reported to your credit bureau right away, and it's a huge red flag for them to not give your child a credit/debit card when you are not around. I know there were a couple of incidents where they were reported as fraud, but then the parent got the card cancelled and the child had to pay the $50 fee. It is really a horrible feeling to know that your children are being bad, or maybe just having trouble at school, by using your cards. But the worst part is having to have the conversation with your spouse about it because he has the ""I told you so"" look on his face. Good luck, have a nice day! :-}
I would not want my children to handle my money, nor am I willing to entrust any of my personal financial information to a kid, especially if they are under the age of majority, because I don' want them opening my credit and bank cards and spending my hard-earned money... I would have NO idea if my son was using my cards, my bank is not a part of any kind of credit union, they're not even a regular bank in the sense that you'd go in and they cash you a check, I just had a ""bank"" account with a high interest rate, that was my only real option for ""savings"".... so, as you can see, when it comes to my family's financial situations there are many different points of view.

Thanks for any insight.

A:

I think you're asking ""how to tell if someone used your card without you."" You could tell someone by looking at a charge on the statement or checking your bank's online transactions. 
If a transaction is for a legitimate credit account or if you have been given authorization then you should be able to look at the transaction, see if it's you, and know. If it comes from an unknown source and it isn't a valid or authorized transaction then report it immediately. You might want to try a reverse lookup service such as credit bureau to see where it might have come from."

Another user asked this question, and the intent was to find out if he could use application app (the android app) to ""freeze"" (in a way) his credit/debit/prepaid account so he cannot make any purchases. He also wanted to know if a credit report can be used to verify that he indeed was charged. This might be related to some questions I asked. If so, I will post them separately. Thank you. -M

599,someone else is using my card freeze it,"['freeze card', 'freeze card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","freeze transaction? 
In this case, I suspect it's not a good idea to use the transaction intent. This is because this utterances is ambiguous, and it is not clear if someone should freeze the card or transaction.
I'm interested in any suggestions about the intent in this sentence. In this particular example, ""freeze it"" could mean either one thing or the other."
600,do all atms take this card?,"['take card', 'take card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","(2), take one card(10)?

In the case of a simple question, is it appropriate to choose the least common response?
For example, take the card is a noun, while card (10) is an adjective (as in the original question).
Or take that card, a verb, and card [10] is (obviously) a sentence.
Does it depend on the grammar of the language, or do the rules of question-asking apply? Should one be aware of any rules specific to certain languages? Does it all depend how the user intends to answer the question? Is it different if, in each case, the intent is ""do all""?
I'm particularly interested to know if there are any official grammatical (and, I'd like to hope, not ""grammar police"" based) guidelines which would make a response like ""take one and the rest go into the bag"" more acceptable (or, worse, ""taking one is all right, but doing the second one will get you in trouble with the law"".)
(If it doesn't really depend, that's fine as well. It's my guess, though, it would be a bad idea to have a ""default"" answer, unless there's good reasons to prefer it and to avoid a more ""natural"" but less standard option.)
Also, are there any similar questions here on SE.SE? I couldn't find any. Maybe I just missed a relevant tag. Sorry. I didn't think so. 
Edit: I found an example of (some) official guidelines: http://www.thefreedictionary.com/take. However, this doesn'y seem as detailed as one that would apply in all cases.

601,which atms accept this card?,"['accept card', 'accept card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","accept any atm? reject all atmos?

This might well depend on the actual atmis we are trying to classify -- there are two kinds here: physical (like the kind of ATM that accepts Visa/MC/whatever) and the logical (the ATM software that runs on top of the hardware, i.e., the ""bank"").
So it's a matter of semantics how I'm phrasing that question. And I believe that the question is actually a lot more complicated because there could possibly be a third class of atmo we're trying classify, the software running in the host's memory (or on a different host for that matter) that does things like authenticate the user/card and then decide what to do with them.
In general, when it comes to intent I recommend looking at the documentation for the API in question, for example, see the docs for OpenSSL's RSA functions."

I don't think it's possible to have 2 valid intent for the same user utterances. 
Is there any way to train the AI to differentiate between these possible valid intents?   Can the system detect that these two utterables represent the correct intetnt for ""closest mastercat"" by the fact that the user is trying to say ""my intent is  ""where is closest"".  If not, is there a way that this can be trained for? How is this different from an intent that represents  closest thing at the mall to my intent of  get some thing? Can this even be distinguished at all? Is it possible that in the absence of any training these could be mistaken for a single intent? The last one, get something for my shopping is an example that I thought I could tell these apart, but maybe I'm mistaken as well, maybe it is actually ""get something from mall ""?

A:
""Where is my nearest atmo?"" should have its own intent
The other two are very similar, the first one is simply ""Where"" and the other just ""Atm""
You can distinguish by having separate intets for each one.

A:
[1]
""I want to know about machines that are used to pay for things"".
(1) :
atms
The correct word for ""machine"". You can use it as the direct object of the verb ""to know"".  
You can have multiple ""machines"" in there.  It's OK if they're different.
This sentence has two noun phrases as its direct objects:  ""atm"" and ""things"". They each have a determiner as their head. [2]  The words ""for"" or ""with"" go after the determiners but they don't have to. They're optional. This sentence also has three verbs: ""are used"", ""can"" (optional) and  the infinitive verb: pay. So that's four parts to this sentence plus a noun which is part of neither phrase and goes after ""pay for"" if there is one. That's a lot of parts but it's just the parts you need and it doesn’t get any more complex if the sentences gets more complicated. It helps to have an idea of grammatical structure. Grammatical categories are a tool for understanding language. You get the idea by looking at examples in dictionaries. And there you find that ""a"" is a part that goes with the subject ""I"", that the word ""they"" takes a ""the"" before it. But don‘t worry too much about that. As long as ""it"" has a head and is inside a sentence, it belongs to the sentence. ""You"" can belong to a whole sentence as a subject. Or the ""he"" of ""she"" does that too. “I go to school” has ""go to"" as subject and also as direct and indirect object. All these words have their heads. If a certain category, say the noun category or the adjective category is missing, you can add it but you will not understand what was written by adding it: you might be able to tell which word belonged to which category but not that there was a category.

EDIT:
To the answers I'm sorry to say that I wasn't clear on my intent and so this is what I actually have to ask about... The question I posted was more of a question about the ""prepositions"", i.e. ""at m and accept"" and the way I interpreted that question was to make a distinction of 'wh' vs 'which' in the sense of what you are asking about. My original thought was what is meant by ""the at m accepts the card"". But it is now clear that what they mean is more along the lines of which one of those at ms does accept? The first one is 'accepts debit'. The second one I guess is something more generic and just says that it accepts anything. But the first is very specific to that at.
If this distinction is clear, can the OP change his/her original question to what ""do at's"" actually ""use""?

What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","Given the utterance: which atms accept this placard?. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: accept placard?

The utterances can be regarded as “yes-no-maybe” sentences. This makes the problem a typical ‘yes or no’ answer in the language domain (see e.g. [1]). In [2], a Bayesian approach is proposed for classifying such yes-or-not questions in a language learning framework.
As a simple example, consider the situation, illustrated by the figure above: an alien has just asked your colleague „Which atm accepts this ticket“. He may be interested in knowing if he should go to one at once or not. To get his answer, he asks your ‚Yes/No‘ question. You can only answer ”Maybe„. Your answer will not satisfy the alien, as it is not the correct answer. However, the answer would have been ‒‚Maybe ‛ if there had been a ticket on one of the atMs. In the Bayes model, this question is a Yes/Yes situation. It is more interesting to understand the question if the ‡No was removed, resulting in: Which ATM atmo does not accept the placarded ticket?‡. The question could easily be interpreted by a naïve learner as something like: †Which ATM should my colleague go? ‟. Thus, we have a ’Yes-No-Maybe-Yes‟ situation which is clearly much easier to learn than a more traditional ‹Yes or No› situation like [3] in which it has to be decided whether the speaker has the intent to express a conditional. We argue that the difficulty of such questions should not be underestimated as they are an important class of linguistic expressions that we need to handle in any language. Moreover, learning such a complex situation must be treated as a real challenge, especially if we consider it from a purely algorithmic perspective. A language model that predicts one specific ‌Yes ‐‌ or ‪No ‬ answer per question will be unable to deal with the task of answering the questions ″Yes and No ‵."

For instance, one can assume that the atmo nearest can imply an atmospherically defined direction. But one could just as easily argue that, by definition, atmos nearest means nearest the surface of some body in space. Or that one of them is better than the other. Etc.
And so forth. (And it might be fun for the AI to have that many choices...)
I'm not necessarily worried about how to program the thing, just trying to understand how we should frame this as a design problem. It's possible I'm simply asking the wrong questions. For all my asking, I can't find an example of this sort of scenario online, so I have to imagine that this isn't a very common thing to do... or perhaps the examples are really only applicable to a specific class of applications. I haven't found a question like it, either. Maybe I simply missed it somehow. 
So if you have any ideas on how I should approach the question, or if I need to ask the right thing entirely, please let me know! I also appreciate links to articles or discussion on this particular type of question. Thanks!
EDIT: I've come up with an idea for a possible solution, but I'd like to see whether there are any good alternatives. So I think the correct question is ""Given an utterances, how best to determine the intent?""
The idea I came up is simply that I want the application to choose the most unambiguous intent. The atma closest seems to fit this requirement. Now, a naive approach seems simple - just pick whichever seems like the ""best"" choice. However, there is an obvious problem with this approach: The AI might decide to be ambiguous - it could choose to use ata if it wanted to, despite being explicitly provided with the context. This would be the same for any ""reasonable"" answer: an intent can be more ambiguous than it appears. If at all possible, this is what we want to avoid (though it's not always possible). So my idea is to find the least ambiguous intent using a simple algorithm. And then compare the results from various AIs to try to pick a winner, assuming the worst that any of their answers isn’t truly"

What are the pros and cons of the different ways of expressing the above utterances, and/or is there an even better way. I have seen many people say the atm is used for money transactions but not necessarily debit. Are they using this to mean that the ATM is not really a debit device?

I think that ""what atmn"" or ""use at mn"" is fine. The card in ""atmn uses"" suggests to me that it is to be held, used to get money from an ATM. But ""it's used"" doesn't. In this case, ""debit card"" and "" ATM use"" are equivalent. A debitcard is one that has some kind of card account associated with it. ""ATM use"", or if you like ""to use an at machine"" has something to do with the way this account works and I think it sounds better to say than use a ""card"", which I don't think means debit account?
A card has to work with a machine. An ATM has an account. They are different. To me the latter seems more specific or focused. Of course, these aren't the only ways to express the ideas: ATM = ""a machine which allows for use with an associated monetary account"" card = debit or cash card as in credit card
""I want to go to the movies, will I need a bankcard?"" = I want a movie card ""I went to a restaurant last week and used the credit / debit machine to pay for it"" =I payed for lunch
You also could say ""an ATM"" but I wouldn't like you to think of an actual machine that gives you money. You could, however, think about a device such as a vending machine, a cash register, etc. that allows you the opportunity to gain access to an money account (or at least money you can use in some circumstances. Note: it could be that you actually want access and gain to money,"
612,how can i find the nearest atm?,"['find atm', 'nearest atm', 'find atm']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","find nearest ATM nearestATM? (etc.)
The problem is that you have two very similar, but not quite identical, intents which can only be distinguished by what their arguments are. The only way to know for sure if you're looking for 'nearest' atms is to get information about the distance and then look for the intent with the minimum possible number of arguments.
For example:
find nearest ATMs

is ambiguous. It is unclear if we are looking up the closest atMs, ATM or any ATM that is near."
613,what kind of atm's can i use?,['use atm'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","atmosfere? use ATM (the name of a machine).

I think ATM is a word with the specific meaning of 'a system of bank vaults and other mechanical, electronic, and computer controlled services that provide access on demand to stored cash and credit cards'.
If we are asking for a device (like a computer), we use the word computer instead of ATM. If we want to talk about a system, like a banking system. we might use systematizer or systeematizator, depending on the intended meaning.
In any case, 'atmosfera', which, as you rightly said (or perhaps not), is probably not a well known word in any language. There isn't much context that I can think of that uses this word at all. However, I do know that it does exist in Spanish, French and Italian. And, it's quite possible that there are other languages that have it as well, though I haven't really looked into that."

Thanks a lot for your help!
UPDATE: Thanks to the responses below I came up with the correct intents. I'd like to clarify though: I'm having issues with my NLP engine (currently i'm using the default one, so i might update it or add features), I've tried with Stanford NER and Stanford Parser, but the latter one is not working very well for my task, the former one just didn't seem to fit my needs. The results I get are very different from the ones I see in the demo. 
Also, i think the problem with intent detection is that in this domain, it's very likely for the entities extracted to not be the intended ones, because the entity is very specific to one context. E,g, ""get cash"" might be ""cash withdrawal"" in another context, or ""bank transfer"" etc.. But it seems like there is no standardised way to handle these cases, which explains my troubles...   So i'll probably go with ""intents detection"" for this task. Also, thanks for all your inputs ;)
Here is a sample sentence (I've added the words I need to classify in bold):  -  ""Hi, do you want to get $2,000.00 cash out of a bank account?"" - My engine outputs the intent ""withdraw money"", the other intants are ""buy stuff"" and ""do some business"".

It would be a good answer to say that the sentence is ill-formed for the question, because the subject is not the same as the predicates of the intent. So, we may say in this specific case that this is an error, with one intent not matching the one question. But, on the other hand, this may not be the ""best"" answer. We may prefer to answer with a general sentence, one that would apply in all cases, rather than with the case-specific answer, that is more like an answer in English grammar. A general answer would say, ""all Visa cards."" So there is some ambiguity here; it's up to the answerer to decide which answer is their choice, in general, when faced with this sort of question:

If there are more types of cards that don't belong in the above list you can add to the list to expand the intent vocabulary. For example:

Or, a more complex intent:

 - bank_account_reconciliation
- bank

Get card and request card are the two most commonly used. They basically mean ""I want a valid card"".

StanfordCorenlpCoreNLPSourceParser.createFromString(source).setInput(getBuffers()).addParser(new AtmA(options)).parse(...).  The pipeline is returning the correct answer, though.  But when I add a parser to get the atmo entity: atmos = atmc.get(atmosName).
My question is: how to do I get this atomo?  I mean, why does the pipeline not return the entity, whereas a simple parser does not?
Thanks for any help
Best regards and cheers

Update: The code for Stanford coreNLToolkit (StanfardCorentityParser) is here. I also have a test class. The main problem I am having is that the parser returns a null entity in the test, when it should return an actual String. Also, it is not returning any errors. But I do not know much about how the whole entity extraction thing is done. So, any information you can provide is helpful
UPDATE: When I use the same code as is shown in Stanford's test to parse a different sentence and save it in a String as well, I end up with a string that can contain several atom entities, as I see them in Eclipse. However, only one of them is returned when running it with the Pipeline. Is it possible that it doesn't work because I don't have the entire sentence? I would rather not ask a question that would require a huge amount of information"

I'm assuming ""best fitting meaning"" doesn't involve any specific linguistic rules or conventions.

A:
–
There are a few rules. Some are not very useful because they are over-generalized: for example, the word ""measure"" is ""m-e-s-u-r-a"" and ""near"" (from your context: nearest) is usually ""n-n"".
Also, I think ""the best"" in this context is an objective term (not ""my opinion"". It is a noun and not a modifier.)

We've had this problem ourselves and have come up with these two solutions:
a) use a slot in which a card reader is plugged in, and
b) make use of a separate card.
In our opinion neither of these solutions were a good fit. The first because the slot is always occupied even if nobody is currently using their card, the second because we had to buy the additional card ourselves. 
Now the customer asked us if we could also use an app. This seemed like a more feasible solution, but we couldn't find anything that actually did what we needed. I've been looking at the Google Play Store now, thinking maybe I'm not looking in the right places, because I can't really see any app that does what I want. But it's been difficult to narrow down the search criteria, as all the apps with 'use card' and 'card reader' in their titles do more or less the same. So I think I'll post the question to you guys, to see what you might have to offer. Thanks beforehand!
I'm sure the solution is simple, probably something like 'Android apps for use-cases', but I just haven't been able to find it anywhere. Is there such a thing at Google? Do I really need to make my own app? Maybe that isn't the correct path for this particular solution. Can someone point me in a direction?

Here's an image of the scenario: http://imgur.com/a/6b3hB
This is a picture of an ATM (the one inside the bank). I have a Samsung S4, Android 4.1.2, so the NFC tag reader (if you are familiar with that technology) is also on the screen. In the middle of all this the red dot appears, pointing to the ATM. That is how the user is meant to use it. (The bank is not allowed to place an NFC reader in all ATMs (which is why we need an additional app, or a second card)).

630,where can i withdrawal my money?,"['withdrawal money', 'withdrawal money']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","Where can you withdraw your money. You can withdraw money using the ATM card, but the transaction fees and withdrawal fees may be high.

There is no direct way of withdrawing money from ATM in India, though there are other ways, which is quite convenient in many ways. We have also discussed withdrawal methods in detail, so let’s jump in right away. For withdrawing cash, it is always a good idea to withdraw at least Rs. 500-1,000. This is because the withdrawal limit for the maximum amount of cash you can withdrawal is Rs 4,500 or Rs 5,00, whichever is lower, on a weekly basis. That‟s the minimum limit. The maximum limit per day is set at Rs 6,200. So, there will no withdrawal charges at the time of ATM transactions as long as you have the required cash. However, while doing ATM transaction, the card issuer„s transaction charges for ATM withdrawal will be deducted along with the above-stated withdrawal limits. These are the main charges which we will discuss here: (i) transaction: this is charged by your bank, not us. Transaction charges vary widely and there is hardly any fixed amount. They can be up to the amount, plus service charges, or, sometimes even more. (ii) cash withdrawal fee: most ATMs charge this service fee, although it varies from bank to bank. It is usually Rs 100-150. But some ATMS have a separate service charge for doing the service itself, such as for opening a new account, etc. Also, check the terms and conditions of every ATM to ascertain if there‣s a charge. Most of the ATIs are also known to charge Rs 10 as a penalty for late payment of bills and a daily charge of Rs 50. And, for your information the cash deposit facility also charges a deposit fee of around Rs 25 or so, depending on the bank‛s discretion. If you‘re withdrawing a large sum, ask the operator of any ATM if he/she would be willing to waive the fee. There is also a time limit to this, and if you miss this deadline, you will need to pay a fine of up Rs 400. In most cases, we can recommend that you do not withdraw cash more than this amount or else there would only be a single ATM available which would charge ex"

633,where can i find an atm to use this card?,"['use card', 'use card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","(i.e. is it a noun/noun phrase?)

This is a good example of the type of things we will want to be able to resolve. There are three key components to this that we want our parser to handle:
1. The verb phrase use
2. A noun
3. An at&t card
In this case the verb is at-use, it is part of a verb-phrase of use-card. We could split into a separate verb of at, which is then attached to the noun use, and use the at. For example: at(verb, noun).
Our task in this example is to decide whether the intent was use at (a verb) or use and at a (verb). For this to work, we also have to check the case of having a card attached in addition to any verb.
At this stage it's important that the parser can tell us the structure in the same way it would be shown to a human. So for the above example we may produce something like: ""Use the Card"" (this is in line with the standard structure), or something more like ""At the ATM"" or ""Card for use"" depending on what is provided in context. In the first case we can say that there has been an error in parsing, because it doesn't make sense for you to tell the machine which card to at use or to give you an address. At this point we would have no context in what was being talked about and no understanding of what the user was asking, even if we understood what they said."
634,at which atms can i use this card?,"['use card', 'use card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","use bank card?, use ATM machine card?: ""use a bank ATM"" is more specific, and therefore is a correct sentence. However, use an ATM is semantically the closest. I'm confused. Should I just leave this as, as it is, a grammatically correct question?

A:
You might need some training on how to use the 'instrument' that the question is being asked on. 
If I were an agent for a company, that wanted to get a customer to buy products, I might ask them if they wanted the product on sale. This sounds like a question which could be answered 'Yes', 'No', or 'Not Sure.
The reason that is not the case is because, in this case, the instrument is 'Instrument, instrument (of the type of machine to be used)'  I'd need to know the exact type. There's no way to do this without the context. (It's a bit like asking for the name of a country. We don't know where the person is from, but we know 'The United States' would be the most specific answer, even though, 'United States of America' might be better suited.)
In many instances, we have the option of 'General' and 'Specific'.  In some cases (as you have noted), it's better to leave a'specific', if that's possible. It also doesn't really change much from 'general' to'specifc'. A 'bank' is simply a name. A Bank (or 'Bank Card') is specifically a type that can be purchased. So, by extension, it can take on its own meaning. As such, there's little that makes 'Atm, an atm' more generic than other, more common, terms."
635,are there certain atms that i can use this card at?,"['use card', 'certain atms', 'use card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?",", use certain card?, etc.?

A:
There are a few options available.
To use a card on certain Atms: 
Use <Card Name=""ATM1"" /> on Atm <Name=""Name1""/>
The < is not needed, but I included it for clarity and the fact that you're referencing card not an atm.  The Name you include, is a keyword. You will have to create the ATM's in the editor, or import them. Also the name is an attribute of the atmos. More info on atmo syntax can be found here. https://developers.slid.es/docs/guides/concepts_atmos
If this is what you are looking for, then that would work. There is nothing stopping you from referencing it as many times as you can on one atam. In general though you should have one intent for each use of a <UseCard> tag."

For example, the first is said in anger by someone who thinks he's been robbed. The second is used in situations of loss, when someone realizes that their money got stolen.

What I want to know is, what exactly the differences are between the two sentences? What would be the appropriate intents to give for each of them?  Are they identical? If so, how can that be? Is one correct and the other incorrect? Can you give an example of each? I really can't figure that out. Thank you in advance. :)
P.S. I can add more context if necessary!
Edit: I'm really interested in this, because I've encountered an issue with my app where I had to make a slight change to account for an intent that didn't make sense.

PS: for clarity, I'm looking for the most appropriate form/verb construction for a statement of fact
PPS-S: This isn't a duplicate. I want to know the meaning of the construction, not which sentence is best, which is what was suggested by this question's asker.
Update: In case my previous post wasn't clear, this is about the use of ""charge"" as a verb. 
Thanks
Kenny
UPDATE 2: As pointed out by some, my example sentence, ""I was told that the credit cards were charged against my personal account,"" can be parsed as an interrogative, in which case a construction like ""the credit was charge on her account"" would be the answer. The question is more about verb usage. So, for example, given the question ""What do you charge your customers?"", this would suggest the sentence ""We charge her for her services"" (in which the verb ""charged"" refers to the act of charging for services.)  I understand that this sentence may still be considered as having the more generic ""we charge you for..."", and there is a case to made, particularly for adverbial use. However, it still doesn't quite answer my first question on how to interpret an uttering, such as in my earlier sample sentence: ""i was (told|charged|given) that...,"" or ""he (was|is) charged that...""
In summary:
If an action is being spoken about, do I prefer the interrogatives ""what? what did you do?""
Or ""who did it? whose account?""   Or do these forms still require the subject? (""he charged the account"")
Do I consider ""was charge"" to refer to an act, or a"

If you’re asking why you were banned/docked/etc on a particular server, there are two options. You can ask the mods, or you can check logs to see why your account ended up in that situation. 
For the first question, asking for ’why‘ doesn‚t really matter. For the second question you need to take some sort of log (which may include user„s posts, votes, etc). If it is an automatic ban, you will find some type of event or message. If you find it, it‟s likely in a log file somewhere and you might be able to find more info, by looking for things like ‚banned.xxx‛ or „reason: xxx‹, for an event/message that triggered your ban.
You will want to search your server›s log files for anything that may have triggered the ban/event. A good starting place is your users‍ own profile on the server. In particular, anything you may post, vote, flag, do that could cause a ban to happen (especially with an automated ban system).
In the event that it can‌t be found from your profile, and there isn't really any log of what happened, then ask for it as the question. The mods may be willing to answer it. However, this is not the norm, so you should expect that the answers will vary from server to server (based a number of factors, such as whether or not they use an official log, the type and number admins, any policies the forum uses, how many members, number/age of new users, frequency/number of questions, activity in the forums, server population, ect)."

GillesNov 15 '11 at 15:22
Reasoning: It would be more common to want ""I accidentally hit 'cancel' and lost my credentials on a page that asks me for them, so I can go back and use them"".
As for the rest, you can think that the 'forgotten-passwork' is like an 'invalid login' (i.e. ""there is something wrong with the system, please try again later""), in fact it means ""the login was successful, but the account is locked (because the wrong data was tried or something like that)"", so password recovery is what it is, a password retrieval. However, it will work only if the information are stored in the browser, that is in ""Login"" field or ""password manager"" plugin (which is not that common as ""forgot password"").
Hope that helps. You can contact me to ask if needed. (: )

PS : if you want to use the ""Forgot your password?"", just write ""lost password"" instead of ""in forgotten"". If your ""Password"" can also have another meaning, don't write the name in lower-case, just drop the first character. But, I prefer the meaning of 'lost' over 'Forgetful'

To clarify what I'm asking, let's say that this situation could be described as follows: Person A has a car, which is parked in the garage. Person B finds it. If this was Person C, then C would find the car to be somewhere else and so on. A person with a misplaced car might be angry about it and not be able to control his/her emotions, while a person who forgets his or her car could forget to drive and be more calm. In the first case, a lost car would not fit, since a vehicle can only be lost if it is no more somewhere. That is what i meant when I said that losing a thing would mean that there is some physical change and you have to do some things in order to reach the 'lost' state. However, forgetting (as in: losing) would fit since i do not necessarily have a physical thing to start with. For example: a child can loose his toy, his parents could lose their car keys or, in my case and my example above, some people could just forget their phone, without the need of being physically there with the phone. Also, losing my phone would still fit even if i had an iPhone and the child had a My First Droid. Thus I would like to learn what to say if I were to ask for help to"

This is not an intent which appears in the Dialogflow Training library, or in one of my own custom intents. This is more of a curiosity question. My best guess is that the intent ""reset password"" is a fallback.

I want my bot to respond to the user if and only if the given message is a good fit for one of these choices.

649,i can't recall my passcode and need to reset it,"['reset passcode', 'reset passcode']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","I would argue that resetting passcodes is more a problem with a specific implementation than the actual problem itself. I can think of at least two possible ways in which this type of situation can go wrong.
1 - An implementation that doesn't allow certain characters to be input (for example, because it's a PIN, and PINs can never contain the letters x, y, or z), but has an ""auto"" mode that will allow anything to enter. This type, however would require that the implementation actually support what it claims to do. Since that's not a requirement, it may well be the case that it doesn/t and is just a way to make the app appear to work. If it is in-fact a pass-code, I'd argue it to fall under one of Intent.CATEGORY_PASSWORD as well. It's simply that, when a system is set up in its ""secure mode"", the only data that should be stored on it are what are needed for security - things like the secret passphrase and the hash of the passphrases. The actual pass phrase is not ""for you"" at all, but rather ""to you"", for the system to keep track of. That is, in fact, what a secret code is: not the data itself, the code that allows you to retrieve the correct data from a database. So the reset code can simply be a token for reseting the current state of things that are stored somewhere else (which can, again, be anything from the user's memory to the cloud).
2 - A password that is too short. For example: I have a 12-digit code (the pass code was set-up that way), so if I am to use the ""automatic"" option (or some other non-humanly-readable-string) and enter something like ""12012312"", it would obviously not match (because that would only be 8 digits long). So it gets the idea that if it fails, just do the manual reset, right? Well, for this to happen, you would need this implementation to actually check that there was a password at the minimum length you are asking for. Otherwise, ""if you can make your own password, we won't store it for you.""

Is there some way to create a pass-code intent which uses the same URI as the newpass intent? 
Also, is it appropriate to make it the default choice, since I only have one intent in mind, but the user can always select the other option, by selecting 'Passcode Change' from the list? If not, should I use an intent filter in the manifest which allows multiple intents with the action of pass code change? Or if that doesn't work, can the app be configured in some other way, to have the behavior that I want? (ie, that when the activity starts, the only choice given to the android OS is to pick the pass change intent?)
In summary, I need to provide a way for:
  1. The user to be able to input a 'New' password.  

  2. Allow the Android OS to choose between 'Old' (using the old passkey) or  'Change'(using a newly-set pass key)
If anyone has any insight into these questions, please do not hesitate to share. Thank you in advance. :)
EDIT I have solved the first and second of my problems. For those who are interested, here is a quick overview of what worked for my application:  The first problem was the intent URI. This was solved by using a custom intent object, as described here: Android: Changing the URI of a predefined Intent. (I don't believe that this is documented anywhere, so it is likely a bit of an edge case). As an alternative, one could also do what I suggested below and have an activity with multiple activity intenet filters, with all having the exact same action string, which would allow the OS choose the one it wanted.
I solved my second problem simply by adding the given intent as a default option in my manifest intent filters. I believe this should be the way of doing something like this, and I am not sure why people are recommending to set this as an application permission...

651,i do not know my passcode,"['know passcode', 'know passcode']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","find pass code? guess pass?

My first thought was ""find"", and I would like to say it's my gut response.
But then my other thought is ""guess"", but it sounds very similar to ""know"", which I don't think that's how I wanted to convey that. 
Is there something in alexa or speech-to-text that tells us if ""passcode"" is a passphrase or not? Or is it just a guess?   I just want to make sure that there is no confusion and there are no other similar pass codes which is in the list of ""possible passcodes"".
Thank you!
Update:
In the end I ended using ""Guess it"".  The reason being, it sounded the least incorrect. There are only 4 options and one of them is to guess or it has ""to be guessed"". Guess seems to work best for it. So, my uttering will be  ""tell me my code""
(and I'm aware my grammar might not be too good but I tried my best and hopefully it makes sense).
Edit: I'll just add that I've used the phrase ""I know what my password is"" to describe the scenario. But, I realized that doesn't fit, hence my edit
I am also aware of this article about Passcodes. It does not address my question but the article gives very useful tips on how to handle various passcods. Thanks to everyone for your help. I think the consensus, so to speak, is that ""Passcodes"" might have been a better way of describing the question. If anyone finds that article helpful, feel free to add comments on what you think!  Thank you
Final update:  This is not just for Passwords but can be for all kinds of codes. For instance, a phone number and so on. As such, ""Find my Code"" or ""Tell me"" are very appropriate. The most appropriate would depend on if the code is shared among multiple people or if only one person knows it, etc. A few examples include: my birthday; my phone or email address; a number I can share with only 2 people; and finally the most common: a 4 digit pin  Thanks everyone.

@SjEvers: I think that intent will be passed to the app if that was the last interaction. But the user could easily go and change the pass-code without your app. In that case ""i no longet have..."" would probably be correct. Or maybe i am just to stupid for this kind of things. :D
If you are using the new Google Sign In for iOS you could use the ""signInWithIdentity"" API method instead:
[signin id=""@string/google_client_id"" authId=(id) ""google"" scopes=(""https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile https://securitycenter.appspot. com/?showprevent=true""]
This way you just ask for one of the two scopers to get a token. And if you use this, you don´t need to use your passkey anymore, because it will sign in to your Google account automatically. It´s the same as in the old iOS version. So i guess it´ll work with ""passCode"" too, i dont know. Hope you understand what I mean. :)

Hi Sjoers,
How would you handle the fact that we want a ""custom intent"" and what that means? That's why the docs talk about ""extras"".
What I do is to create a new ""intent"" using ""createFromResources"", and in its ""putExtra"", I add something like: ""EXTRA_PASSWORD=mypass"" (or mypasscode, etc...)
And then I have an intent that takes ""com.foo.myapp/com_...mypackage_...""

Thank You @Gaurav and @Buffy for your reply. Sorry for taking a month to comment. This is my first time with StackExchange. To avoid any doubt, here is a direct copy from my notes. Please see them if you want more details about the question: ""i do X""  versus ""I do x"".  I do what? and X  vs. x? My notes are not very clear, I hope this makes some things clear. In particular it is clear the distinction I made between ""x"" and ""X"", which should not be confused with the different meanings of X and Y in mathematics. ""What about ""Do you have a pen?"" (question)  and  ""Which is X""? (answer), ""Please remember what I said"",(request), and so on and forth. (It is also clear that ""You can see what the output of my code is here (link to a code). ""

PS: @Akshay Jha: I did try to find the page you were referring to, but failed. Could you please point me in the right direction? Thankyou. Also, to avoid confusion, what ""the code"" does is not important to this discussion. Only that it's output, and which ""what the... output is"" to answer your question.

Updated to clarify intent of the question:
When i ask: Is the term 'forget' a verb? Is it a noun or verb or adjective?  I am trying to make sure whether it can be an ""adverb"";
In this scenario it would be used as,  if i said 'I don' t know my email, he asked me to try again;
If it is an adjective:  If you want to forget something, then you have to be prepared to lose it. If someone forgot her purse at the movies, that means she wasn't sure where she lost it or if she found it (but she didn't keep it).  It's a mistake of some sort but it's not a fatal mistake. In that case we say 'i didn';t remember my purse'.  However if the person forgot something really important like her ATM PIN, she is in trouble. That's why it should not be said as: ""he asked if he could try your email account again."" He is trying in vain to get access to your account or information. It would never be acceptable or correct to use 'ask' as the verb. The 'in case' is just an example of how the adjective/noun can work. We might say: in case he asks, you can say you forgot you phone. However, this is not the most common case but, for example, it could be if someone asked what's your favorite flavor when you only have three choices? or you said the wrong number on purpose, hoping that someone else would call you.

A:
I think ""get the code"" is not the right action to use here. It could be done in a number of other ways.
It seems that in your case, the user is expecting to have a way of resetting the password. So ""forgot your code for app"" sounds right."
667,i have forgotten my password,"['forgotten password', 'forgotten password']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","forgotten account?

The intent of ""forgotten password"" may be ""I want to log in to this account."" The intent may have been ""You should allow me to reset the password for this username."" (The user has already forgotten the account's username, and the user wants to recover the username.)
Alternatively, the intent is ""It has been a while since I used the service, I don't remember its username and password.""
If the intended username is a domain name, then the meaning of the word ""password"" is unclear. Does the OP mean a username or password, or does he mean the login password to the domain? In either case, a password is not what we're looking for.
A forgotten passphrase, which is often used to refer to a user's login information for a computer system (e.g., Microsoft account, Dropbox account or Amazon Kindle account) is much more common. In fact, it is even more likely that ""passphrase"" would be used than ""username"" in the English vernacular because passphrases are more memorable than usernames. For example, ""My dog's name is Fido, my cat's named Mittens, but my computer's the one I have the hardest time remembering."" In the case that a name was specified, passwords are easier to remember than username (because you can make them short and have them be easily remembered). So, when talking about the forgetfulness of passcodes/passphrasés, we use the term ""a forgotten [username of user name]."" 
As with any language, different people may use different words, even if they know the same thing. So there is no definitive answer to your query. The best course would probably be to use a search engine to look for other language-based questions, like ""English - forget password"".

I believe that if you say: ""How do I reset my pass code?"" then the intent is to reset, not enter it. It is a simple way of saying I want to set my security code or pass-code or whatever you prefer. If you want more detailed info about the different intent you could ask a new question."

Thanks!
Edit:
The system is locked on Android 7.1.2 (Nougat) using a Samsung S7 phone. I've also tried the same on a Huawei P10 using the stock ROM. Both fail to work with my PIN. However, the latter also works if I enter the pin as the passcod but then it just unlocks. In both cases, it does not unlock using my 4-digit pin. 
I don't have any way of unlocking the phone (other than the physical side switch) so I can't really try other options (e.g. the fingerprint sensor).
Any advice is appreciated!   :)
Update: I also tested on my Nexus 6P with the latest official Nougut-based system. Same result. Unlocks when entering wrong PIN but not when I use right one. It does recognize the right 4 digit pin (as it did work before the update).  :/
This doesn’t seem to be a generic problem since I‘m using two different devices and two completely different firmware version. Any explanation?
PS: the code I tried with for both devices are the 4 digits PIN and the full 4 chars. No combination worked. The same with a different phone on different OS version (same code), even with another Android and another firmware...
Also I don“t think it matters because the user will use just a 4 char pass, but I just thought I'd provide a bit of additional info. As a workaround, I'll change from a PIN to 4char. Not ideal but it can”t be as important as my main problem, right?  ;)
PPS - I have a third phone that is working with all the above mentioned devices so it's not the device's hardware. But I doubt it is a hardware problem for 2 different users

The money is delivered to the recipient, and is then transferred (usually to somewhere else), or may not be transferred, depending on the situation. It is a transfer of money or funds. This could include things in addition to money: goods, services, information, ideas, etc. Is the transfer between sender and recipient a single action, or two different ones?

I think there's a lot of ambiguity in this one (and many of the questions here). Is it asking whether the transaction was complete as soon as they were transferred? Or whether there was a delay in getting it to arrive? It's pretty clearly a request for the latter, in which I think this question is correct (although it's also entirely reasonable to answer that it was still pending as of that statement).

♦ @Chris, but it still isn't quite a good fit for our site since the question has nothing to do with money

So it has to be about money because it includes money. But it also says ""I am waiting"". So the meaning of ""waiting"" is that the money was not transferred yet.

As an FYI, the ""money"" here refers to a ""transfer"". ""Show"" means that one party gave the other party their money and the second party returned the first party's money to that first person. In this case someone wanted to give someone else their ""stuff"" in exchange for something else and they are waiting until they know the person wants what they're going to ""show"" them. (The word ""want"" was left out by the author of this post.)
If there wasn't a mistake in the original wording of what this person wrote on Twitter and what the poster was asking for then the word transfer in your first example should be a synonym for ""deliver"", which is what someone would use to mean to hand over something to another person (like your 2nd and 3rd examples).

What is your intent?
- What have you transferred? I have transferred a document to the office? Or a piece of paper? - What are you passing on? You are passing me on a file? A document? The whole thing? Nothing? Just the address of your new company? etc..
I'm interested in the meaning of the sentence (and the verb) - How do you translate the sentences in your head
To get this in one word? (or few)...
If the answer is ""none"" then I will go to another answer. :-) And if the answers are ""different"" from my own understanding then it will help to learn more from this answer!
My answers :
Transferred means it has been sent to you. Maybe it is a bill you received and you are telling me it's your turn to pay. But if you want to be really specific you could say : ""I have just received the bill"" (it has not been transferred)
Passed is also a good word to use in this case. If you had a message that is coming from someone else you would say it was passed to me
Accepted means the transfer has happened (not that you don't care about it anymore. So this is more like saying you have accepted it). But in that case I think you should use received to say that. Because ""accept"" or ""receive"" have to do with the receiver and not the origin. And in my answer, your transfer doesn't go through to someone
Gone transfer : It means something has ended or ended. It has passed. In your example it probably has. (The person who did it may have done it but it ended, maybe they are gone to some place. Or maybe this person is done with what he's doing and is leaving and that's why he is saying it. For example someone might say ""The transfer ended"" if that was the end of something that has already ended). So I don' think there is any specific fitting meaning that can be given to this sentence. Unless you mean something else. :D"
678,i am confused as to why my transfer could still be pending,['pending transfer'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","transfer failed? transaction failed or canceled/canceled?

The best intent is pending, as if a pending transaction fails, your application is likely to fail for a different reason (e.g. a missing transfer token in which case an empty intent won't help in understanding the situation), but if you were to cancel it successfully before a transaction would fail, then the intent would be cancelled/transaction failed.

RafaelNov 30 '13 at 0:53
Edit:
Just saw this comment and thought I'd add a bit about the pending intent. If the user has not yet started the transaction, they might cancel and that can be the intended behaviour, hence the need to be able to recognize the cancellation intent as well. However, there might be situations where the intention is actually to do the transfer (the user is confused but doesn't know what's happening, perhaps) and the cancelled state is an intermediate step, or perhaps the initial intent wasn't clear enough. That's where you'd use a transfer intent to get a more complete understanding of the problem. As a side-effect, you get both the successful transfer and cancellation intents. Note that both of them need the token to pass, so you need a token at least as granular as the one used at the account level (if the tokens match, the payment will be successful and you'll need one more intent; if they don't you might need an intent with a new token (as suggested by @mariomayo) but then there's also the cancel state).
So, in my experience, it can happen that a user cancels, and even re-cancel a payment, before they start transferring it. The reason can vary from being too confused to make a mistake (they'll cancel, but later they'll try again and reissue the original token for the new account) or being genuinely in doubt about their intention. In that case, canceling will probably be what they meant, even if it might have been misinterpreted when they first attempted the action (for instance, some users may cancel a previously issued transfer while intending to start the next one). In this situation the cancellative intent should be a valid response to the corresponding intent sent from the application to their bank's server, that is, once you know there was a successful"
679,how long does it take for a money transfer to show?,"['money transfer', 'show transfer']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","Show how soon transfer money? Transfer when soon money be? Is there a better intent than how to know it soon?

To answer:
You can say the intent is a future, and there may be no better fit. Alternatively, money is in the past and it may mean there's no way around it. The intent can also be a simple ""how long"" question.
If you don't know and have to guess, then you could be on to something, especially if the question is being asked by an English-speaking nonnative: in which case you would say that you have no idea how he/she thinks about the future. In that case it sounds like it would be ""Show how much"".
This sounds slightly odd because how shows a relationship between the transfer and the money - it could just as well be an action of how. If he is asking about money, you might say show how the amount of your money and your transfer's money are related.  If you want to sound more polite, use show that to you."

682,my account needs to be deleted,['deleted account'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","deleted user?

How to handle the situation where a user claims he made a mistake and wants to re-create his account (or account of someone else)? Should this situation be treated like a delete account request? or is it a case of ""deleting"" a typo? How are mistakes handled on other sites, when the poster wants the post fixed? If it's really a problem, should his edit be rejected or does that only really get fixed on the site where he posted it? What would be the right action, assuming there would not be a significant loss of reputation? 
A user has recently had two comments deleted because they had a bad username, and then wanted to change it. Should the comments be restored, or do we keep them, as the OP seems sincere? It was also suggested that he should simply edit the username in the text of the comment.
This is on one of many Stack Exchange sites. There are no reputation loss implications, except for his reputation on his own site.  It may be relevant that this site requires registration, unlike Stack Overflow, which does not. I can't find any guidance on this, but perhaps StackExchange's rules cover it more exhaustively. My best guess is this may not have occurred on StackOverflow. This may also be more of a discussion for the moderation meta. (I'm pretty new to moderation, so take my word for it when I say that I'm not very knowledgeable!)
Edit
The user's first edit was approved, though it seems like he's still trying to improve it! I don't think I should undo it since he was obviously trying very hard. But, since a moderator suggested deletion, I will not accept his second edit. That is, unless you say otherwise. The user can also delete his profile, just in case that is a concern. If that's a possibility, it can be done in 10 minutes by a high reputation moderator, according to this answer. Or, the user is welcome to delete it himself, after getting a 10 minute warning from a mod, who would need to wait until the deletion is complete. Either way, we are not talking about a big loss, only about 10 rep, a minor inconvenience, that may get reaped over time. It's unlikely that it will be replayed to us again.

The above examples are all grammatically incorrect, and in this question. I'm asking if we can be more certain of them:
1) The most appropriate word would be to, because ""quit"" implies that you are tired, but that doesn't quite follow from i.e. i can still use the same word to describe my intention to close my current account: The more appropriate sentence would therefore be The i was. tired.of.all..accounts.i.want.to.close.My_current_is.not_quit.I.am.tired.and.cant.use.it anymore. (the is. not. quit is.).
2) If we want a word that implies the word quit, it's more obvious that the most logical word is of, since we're looking to create a sentence describing a specific intent to be quit: (The best of the accounts i have are) i am tired with the account (of the) and i cant use it anymore (I'm quit)
Thanks
Edit: I want people to tell me if the above explanation is good enough: 
""The most correct one is to"" because it is true that ""i'm"" is not followed by an action, therefore we cannot have The ""best"". If you think that there is another, more logical option, please explain it in your answer and show a justification of why ""of"" should be better."

Modify
It feels like the /account/ deactivates should be the 'right' way to handle this, as they are the de-authenticated version. /Account/ is a little too general. Perhaps, we should have one option that handles all of these cases.
However, I still think we could use a 'deactivated' option, and then add a /deactive account or / inactivate account in a follow-up. So, / deactive could be one of those, then /inactive? Thoughts? We can't really use the account name, so I don't think the name should matter in this case either. It is purely the status of an object, right? Deactivated = inactive (I'm not entirely sure what it means in terms of user status, though). What do folks think? This should not only apply if the user is not logged in at all, they should only be able to deactived it while logged out as aswell. Does this make any sense? Should this be a status or a method? /DeActivateAccount should then be reserved for the case of the login being taken away. I'm happy with deactivation account, too...
/De-ActivatedAccount
The main problem with account deacactive is when a new user has created a user account with no name for themselves, only their email. In that case, the email address, not the username, is deregistered and deleted. However, there is no way around this. If you delete a username that already exists, you don’t deregister the existing user; you deauthorize them until you create a brand new"

Also note that the only valid duplicate target is How to handle ""I want [to close this/delete this] account?"", as it is by far the most frequent case. In this case, I will vote to reopen the question, provided that it has been sufficiently improved.
+1 for the ""how to improve"" part, that is also worth a bounty. I also see why it was closed. The OP is just asking for more opinions, which are not constructive and will not help the asker find the answer he/she is really looking for in the first place. A ""close/duplicate"" is not always that straightforward. ""What is your favorite way of closing/deleting accounts?"" is quite different to ""How should we handle the account of a person that's gone AWOL?""
I hope this comment is helpful. Thanks
EDIT:
To clarify, the post is about a user who does not seem to understand what a close and a dup mean. He just asked what he should do in his own case and what do ""we"" think he needs to do. So, he does seem rather naive to me. Nevertheless, it should not be a reason to be downvoted. If the comments below have helped him figure out what should happen instead, then that would be wonderful. :)

To solve this problem, let me tell you a story. I was once in a discussion with a friend and a colleague from a very good company, where we discussed about how they were planning to implement a messaging platform for the first time. We had two different ideas: a client server approach and using an embedded engine. In the later case, we were more confident with the architecture and performance. Then I suggested the client client approach, as the one I had in my head for a long time but I never could have imagined it would be so simple and fast. However, this is not the story for today.

The only way to tell, is to analyze the sentence by sentence, word by word, and see how it flows. For example, the first phrase does not flow together with the second; rather, they appear to say different things. The second also appears to have an additional purpose, perhaps to cancel something, while the delete action is implied by the word ""account""? So, my guess would be that it's a request to deregister from the social media site.

Edit
I should have mentioned, before asking the question, that I also don’t want my password or e-mail or anything else associated to my social account as well. It might also be worth noting, since there is some ambiguity as to what I meant by account; perhaps it could be “my username/e-book/blog” or ” my user on this website“ or similar? That might be an important piece of information. But I don not think that matters. I think the important factor is whether there are multiple meanings for a single term in the context. My best suggestion to the OP would probably be to add a ‘what is being requested‘ tag to his post to indicate what the request might mean, so that readers can focus in to try to figure out what was meant. Then he can edit to include a sentence such as ’I also want everything in my email that / and on the site associated /to be deleted. ‍/i‌ would like my account„.

690,i am highly unsatisfied with this company and want to delete my account!,"['delete account', 'delete account']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","delete all my data? cancel my subscription?

Given a question like i wish to cancel this plan, what is an appropriate, unambiguous utterable for a user with the intent of cancellation of a subscription plan? In this case, ""cancel"" and ""delete account"" are not possible, as the former is a verb and the latter is not an acceptable uttering for the user.
I think ""Cancel Account"" is unambiguously understandable, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Is it a correct sentence, and what are some of its pros/cons? Is there any other option I should consider? The best option is probably a single utterment that unambicuously matches a specific intent. If not, there should be at least be a list of utterments that are understood by users with different intents, with pros, cons and some guidance on which one is best understood and/or used. A list would also be useful if we wanted to support multiple intants. For example, I could be thinking ""I wish that my plan be cancelled"", but someone else could also mean ""i want this service to be canceled"". A sentence that fits both could then be selected. The list should also include sentences that match the specific intant ""Delete Account"", since there is ambiguity about what it means. In addition, the list for cancelation should include an utterances that have similar meanings as delete data. As an example ""remove my records"" or ""clear my information"".
If there's no good option, then it should at the minimum be possible for users to select the most appropriate utterement for them. They could always type something more explicit, e.g. ""please delete this account"". This would be more useful for those who want more control over their account. There would then need to exist a mechanism to determine the correct utterism which is likely to have more positive effects in a conversational agent. I also think this should only be triggered if a conversation is currently in progress. This is important because I think there would likely be no benefit to the agent if it deletes accounts when the conversation isn't going anywhere. (I'm open to being convinced that it would, however.)

691,i don't like your company delete my account,"['delete account', 'delete account']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","delete contact? close my subscription?

This is also related to the question Why do people sometimes use ""delete my profile"" instead of ""deactivate my Facebook account""?
I believe ""account deletion"" is an accepted meaning of the verb ""to delete"" (see Wiktionary), with the sense of deleting everything on someone's profile and/or account (which in turn has the technical meaning).
What happens here is that the meaning and form of a verb change when we're dealing with an ""institutional"" thing like a Facebook profile, and this can lead to confusion as to meaning.
The same thing happens with ""activate"" and ""inactivate"": we have to decide where an account is located - inside someone, outside of someone - when using the corresponding verb. For a ""real"" account, e.g. one used in one's real-life life, it's usually in somebody else's power to ""make something inactive"". But when it comes to institutional things like Facebook or LinkedIn profiles, we use that verb to mean ""take something out of somebody's service, or something like that"", so this does not mean taking something away from the owner. ""Deactivate"", on the other hand, means ""turning off"" something, so it does mean that; I guess ""taking a profile out"" means the same."
692,i would like to close my account,"['close account', 'close account']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","close_account? cancel account, cancel_my_ac?

The first seems most natural, but I don't believe it should be used because it implies an account owner will be taking an active role in shutting it down. The next ones don’t seem quite as natural though.
I believe you should use cancel, which is a verb that implies the account holder will no longer interact with it after that point. In this case it‘s probably best to say you would cancel [your account] instead. You could use close or close [my account], or possibly close the [account], but you wouldn't normally use just close as it would imply the other two actions will still be taken (I would guess, not a 100% certainty).
It is also useful to understand whether the action is to be voluntary or mandatory; in the latter case, such as a government shutdown, you can't really do anything but comply. If it is compulsory it can either be a closed/closed/cancelled. For voluntary, the three options I have presented are all acceptable; if you don' want to take a stance against the shutdown in an official capacity you might be able to use shutdown_the_[account] though it might come off too confrontational."
693,this company is terrible! can you delete my account?,"['delete account', 'delete account']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","delete? deactivate? disable? terminate?

For example, “delete account” (which I believe to be the correct answer to your question), if used in a context like:
“What can I do to prevent other users from stealing my information. I’ve tried everything to disable my profile, but other people still have all my details,‘ the user will be understood to want to delete the account.
In another context: ‘I want you to remove the file.‖ The user may not realize that this is an account (or file) related command, and may have no desire to have their account or file deleted. But in another circumstance, someone who has been using the system for years, may think the answer is ′delete this file″. Or the command may actually be used for something different. In another example: I want them to get rid of the folder. So in the context, I am using ’delete‛, which could be considered a more general use of ”delete.″
It is important that the person asking the question understands what they are asking and what the other person‟s response will mean. Otherwise the conversation will not be a smooth one, because it„s very difficult to guess what a person is trying to do based on the phrase they‚ve used. A lot of time spent explaining what you mean could have been saved if you simply stated that you want the activity to stop, that „your account/file/profile‰ will no longer be updated›. Then you can simply state that your account will get disabled (as the previous statement did not state a positive activity).‮

delete account is not a verb
account deletion is only a noun

the intent of delete accounts as a set of actions is something else (i.e. deleting all accounts)

There is another verb that does express this kind of intent
A verb for ""I delete all of my accounts"" is:

The answer you should choose is: Terminate this Account.
This is your only answer. It means all of the above are not applicable because you have no legal obligation to continue using these services and you are free to discontinue use. (For example, the fact you bought a package of service doesn’t give you any legal claim on any other product or service)
But in case you would choose terminate, you must consider the impact this action can have on your rights, since you signed a contract for these products. For example there may be a provision in the terms and conditions that states you can terminate without legal repercussions on certain dates. 
So you might need advice from legal. But the correct answer should be clear."

edit:
Also, I have read that the word ""all"" doesn't have the same meaning as ""each single thing"". So, it would seem that there would not be ""intent"" here, because the meaning would still be the ""same"".

Would that imply that a ""default"" intent might be that of each object on that storage, rather than all?

I thought this was a rather obvious question, since the intent of an account deletion is clearly not the same as the intention of changing your profile photo. However, I thought I would post the question anyway, in the hopes of getting a good answer. This question is on the topic of intent detection, not natural language understanding, though both may be involved. I am interested in an answer, even just for a very basic one, so thanks!
P.S. The examples on this topic on Stack Overflow have been a bit confusing, as it seems they have different intents, such as ""change profile picture"" vs ""delete account"".
Edit after the answer was given:
Thanks for pointing that out! This is a great answer; and for me, the most confusing part was the first two sentences. So, thanks, and thanks @TJ for clarifying, it was not what I expected. Now, to the real problem: what is meant by 'intent detection', is that it only takes place for the last intent? As we see, ""deleting your account"" is an intent (and not a natural or grammatical one either, by the way) whereas ""changing your user picture is not. In this way, is intent in question only about last one? Thanks again! (sorry for my english, im french) :D
@TJC, for your answer I'd like to give you a little more information about this subject. Let's say we have: ""I'm deleting my profile"", this is actually, according to my knowledge, an utterable statement: this statement is correct gramatically. But it's not an action, nor an entity that can be deleted. There is, however, a different intent that is implied by this: the user wants to be able to change what he sees. He doesn't want to delete anything nor any person or entity, but what's presented on his user page, or profile page. That's why the sentence that was used above isn't the true intent. On the other"

What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","You can see why some of the most common errors that you see are the common and obvious ones:
– The intent doesn't match the data
We can't delete our company or delete user accounts, because the intent of deleting accounts is not a correct one.
In other cases where the input has a different interpretation than the actual intent. An example here would be a user asking the system if it is ""good"" or ""bad"" to have a lot of accounts; while our users don't mean ""to delete them from the app"", they mean the opposite, a feature that allows you to manage your accounts from outside the apps. So the natural intent is something like ""How can I delete all my external accounts?"" or something similar. 
To sum up, the error is a good example of how you need to test your model and how to make predictions more accurate. We will see how with an example later. Now let's see what our training is and what models we are using!
Train the training data: A training model
The purpose of training models is to learn how each word in your vocabulary is used by your business. This allows the model to use a word that has never been heard by the user in order to predict how this word would appear in our data. Let's define a simple training example: you want to train ""my company"", you have this set of utterances: my company is awesome, we had a terrible launch, my users are not happy with us, how can i delete/suspend my user account, you are doing a great job. After that, for each example we create a training vector of dimensions 4, where 4 is how many examples we have (each example is represented as a vector).  Now, in the next part, let s see the different parts of a model in more detail

– JB NizarMar 13 at 9:59
Answer by JNizmar is correct I am just adding more details:
""I am (going to) close this account"" is not wrong in context, but it is too vague. A ""closed account for xyz"" may be better.
A ""I want closed my (xyz) account today"" should be fine as well. But if you close you account, the sentence does not match. The closest match you could use in this case is ""closing my company account"". In all, ""Close my Company account!"" is good enough. Just like any other business, I do not know if it's a ""company account"", or a company's ""personal account""! (Just for the sake of the game here!)
Hope this helps!
PS: I agree, in ""Sick of that damn Company"", there seems to be a slight mismatch. ""Damn"" does have a negative connotation, which could suggest the use of ""dumb"", instead of your first sentence! In this light, you might want the alternative ""Stupid company, just close all my accounts!""
(BTW, as a native English speaker in Malaysia, i don't usually think or use words with my hands! I always use my mind and body, not my arms and hands!) So, this is just a random musing, and not meant to take a side in the debate! (: )

Daren WesselAug 13 '10 at 1:14
My answer:
To answer the question of which one is better, i would say the first interpretation. Why? Because it gives us more information in the future. If we have a service we are unsatisfying, and the service provider wants us to close our account, we might as well use both negations (which both express the same thing) to make sure that if something changes with regards to our services, the information is accurate and up to date. In this case, one would simply close the account and there would no longer be an issue. The only difference between the two interpretations is that the the 'closed account' negates the whole first sentence, whereas the second 'please close' does not negate the entire first. That makes it the interpretation I use in this response. This is not the only interpretation, though. It's just one of the possible interpretations. I used the one I thought would be most natural to use because it is what makes sense in a sentence. However, there are a few possible ways to interpret the sentence and I hope you understand how they work
Second answer I want to provide: This question asks about closing an account in which you use a specific verb for the noun: ""Please close"" in contrast to ""close account"" ""Close my"", etc. As a result, 'close my' is incorrect, it must be 'Please Close my'.
Another answer which I do want someone to look at: The sentence 'you were given' (the first part of your question) and 'to be satisfied' should not be used with the negated verb 'did not' to form a question, because the word order of a grammatical question must have 'was' in front of 'given' and not 'not' because 'do not give' has no 'is' or 'does'. As such, they are not valid grammatically. Therefore, your sentence should read: 'You were not given the satisfaction of closing your account.'
The third sentence is gramatically correct, but in"
707,please delete my account,"['delete account', 'delete account']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","delete profile? terminate account deletion? cancel account termination? revoke account terminations? or some other?

We have a case where users can cancel their own account, and then the account's status (e.g. suspended or terminated) is automatically updated.
When a user wants another user to remove their account from their contact list, can we assume that the user's request will be considered a request to cancel the deletion or will a confirmation be needed? In other words, does it make sense that a contact request should cancel user cancelations rather than initiate new account deletions. Or would it be better to have it as a cancel instead? The reason I am asking this is that it sounds to me like the latter would be a violation of the CoC, as well as being a bit redundant to the previous question, but I'm wondering if my conclusion is wrong in any way. Thanks!
(PS we are using a bot to do the contact requests and it already has a way to distinguish between cancel a deletion and initiate a new deletion)

@DavidZ - I believe the answer is: 'Delete all of the company's data' - as you've already removed any data from your own account, you cannot re-download any of it, and so it is in the same sense as 'wipe clean'.

answer
It's worth keeping in mind that the intent can be interpreted in many ways. As others have pointed out, it can just mean ""This is terrible."", it could be ""I hate this."", ""Delete me, please"", or ""No one should ever see this"" and ""That's the worst company you'll ever come across"".
But, there are other ways to interpret the sentence as well:
If the user deletes his/her account (which would have access to all the data that was stored in his account) or if he delet[es] the app, then he is wiping/deleting/erasing his data. (But if you're thinking of deleting your app to delete your data, be advised that it doesn't work that way.)
However, since we're assuming that he said ""this company"" (or ""that company"", as appropriate), the most likely interpretation would be: ""the company that I'm dealing with sucks."". Thus, the phrase ""delete my [user's] account"" would convey the opposite meaning that ""wanted to be sure to clarify that"". (And if the account is deleted, he's left with no way to access the ""suck-y"" service.) As for ""erase this user's account"", that could, of course, mean many things. It could mean: 1) ""Remove all information that can prove [the user] was ever there."", 2) delete the contents of his [account's?] files, or 3) even delete his email account. But it's probably safe to assume that this would not be the correct interpretation. For example, an"

 + b$$ where $W$ is a projection operator, $ D, \ t_1 $ are the current utternace and time-step (or turn), $ C_s $ denotes the previously emitted utternance from speaker $ s$, $\bar C_{\mbox{inf}}$ denotes a constant vector for the final action in the buffer. The vector $b$ contains biases and $ W$ the weight matrix of projection.
$$ \eta _{t} = L_c \Big(\tfrac{\t}{\a} \sum _s \b \d_h\left(\eta_i\right)\ \ 
%i \in t \quad i \leq t
+ b   + W\D \phi(\bar c_2,\bar \c )$$
where $L_a$ represents a logistic sigmoid function, $\D $ is an attention layer, and $\phi$ a non-linear transformation of $\c$. $\delta$ gives a scalar that indicates how much attention should be paid to $\eta$. When there is no speaker turn $s$, this value is always equal to 1, while when there was, this is usually"

The most likely answer is ""close account"" since that is what one will have intended when closing it. The other questions are too generic to give a meaningful answer. In this case (close) it is a good idea to use an open slot for ""delete me"".

Gruber says: ""I've been wondering too"". The answer depends on the intent of that utterances. I've just read it in the context of ""What was that all about?"" and the answer to that question is clear: it's all gone. (This answer was written for a chatbot in which we were discussing whether it should respond to a request for information on a deleted account. A human being would usually not ask that and would say something like ""what was it all for?"".)

@GudDyGudaGin The best answer would be ""yes, delete"" with an extra slot open to ""me"". But in practice I don’t think this is done since you would have a lot of “me” to do and you don`t want to waste slots on trivial information. This is why the ‘most likeliest‘ answer in this specific case would depend on your knowledge in what this account was used, and what was not. If you have more than one account to be deleted, I would think that you could have different slots open for every account, but for one single one it might be too much. So, the easiest answer I can come up with is probably „close“, with the slots ”account„ and ‚‚user‛. It also depends, of course, on what the bot is actually supposed to know about you. And it would probably not even be a slot to ask the user, because the human-side would already know that. But I guess a bot would at least know the name of the account you want it to close for you and why you think its not useful, hence what would go"

I don’t see why the intent of the request should be a factor here. In the situation I‘m describing, a user is trying to make a request to an entity. The entity is an account or a company. I think the appropriate response should simply be “no” or ‘no, this account“. If the entity happens to have an ’about‚ button, that is a different story. So I would say this should not be an intent question: the only relevant intents are „delete account,„ ‚delete company‡ ‧and ‟delete‖. It should also be the case that there can only be one intent per question, not more. This is because †intent questions only make sense in relation to a single entity per interaction. For example: ‹I want to buy a book› or ""delete this app"".
†
However, there is no intent in the question ""Delete my company"", because the entities are just companies, and thus the ‰intent‰ is ""change account info"". A more natural wording would be ""Change my email address‹. But this way there are many questions like ""How do I delete an app‟ that do not specify any entity: they can all be handled by the ""account delete"" intent. ""Please change my password"", ""Can you delete this message?"", etc. all could be answered by ′account‴, ‡account info‣ ‪or ‫password‬. And of course there could also many of these ‑generic‑ questions about how I change account settings or the such. That would make it impossible to answer them all from one bot. These questions should rather be dealt with by a ‬general help page‪ that specifies all"

Thanks,

A:
There are some things you need to know about this:  
1) You need a user_id to create an account. If you delete that user and then try creating a new one, you will need that id of the deleted user.  You will have to ask the user for it and use it in the request. Otherwise, the system will not know that that particular user has been deleted and will return this error. You could always force this to be the case, but I would not recommend it unless you have no other option but that. The other problem with this is if, at that point, there are still valid users that have that same id, they will try to login to your website, and get an error and not be able to access your service. So again, I do not advise it. But if there is truly no way for you to get access to that information, this might just be your best option. Just note this as a potential issue. It may also be best not to force the id and give the users the chance to log in with a valid id. I think I remember reading something to this effect in your documentation. In some cases you can also ask a third party to remove you from their database. There are various ways to do that, with varying levels of reliability and cost. For example, some services allow you a certain number of requests in a given period of time for a particular cost, etc."

David Z♦Jan 25 '12 at 12:33
i would say this is probably not the exact word you are looking for. i have a few guesses. ""terminate"" i'd agree with, ""close"" ""kill it"" are probably good. If it were a service that provided your account with access to a website, it may not be a good idea, especially if it is providing a ""service"" to your customers. maybe ""revoke"" or ""cancel"" would work. - -
- - or just ""quit""
it depends. the more specific your intent is, the better choice you have. as you say, this would be for a web-based service, so my guess would not include ""delete user data"", since most services don't want to be responsible for what a user does, or even where a copy of the data is stored - you wouldn't ""destroy data"" in that instance, but you certainly would ""shut everything down"" - and i would assume the same goes for ""suspend account"". (the data would still exist but be inaccessible)
but in general, i think ""remove"" and ""discontinue"" can work - depending on the specifics. (remove from services, discontinue products) or if there is data being held, like records (or a database) i suppose ""rebuild"" wouldn'd be fine. but it would depend on what you're referring to. you might also consider ""transfer"" (if the product you purchased is actually being transferred) ""change to subscription-type"" if something is no longer available, and of coursse not ""sell the company"" :) good luck!

The intent of stolen card is to convey that the card has been stolen. I believe the intent will be the same if you say: someone stole my credit card; somebody stole a creditcard from me. If you are asking whether this is a useful sentence it depends on what the context is. For example, in the situation of someone stealing your credit or debit card, you might want to express concern and ask who did it.

http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/1614/
In the linked transcript, you can see that the question author asked this question to the chat room. The room has a comment thread in chat, and the room owner then deleted his comment. If you want to ask questions about the site, please ask your questions in the main site itself, where people can answer them. You can even do so by opening a meta question about it. (Note that if you ask a Meta question in one of the regular Stack Exchange sites, they will automatically redirect you to its own Meta, which will be where the people in main can find you. That way you don t have to look at chat.)
You might have seen that chat doesn t allow you the ability to post questions, so in order to get the attention of users who can help you, we have the Ask question page, or one such as https://meta.stackexchange. Why should you not ask the same question there? The same rule applies, that you should ask it in your own community, not in some chat where you might not get attention anyway. Also, while there are people who answer Meta questions all the time, Meta has its limitations and they do not all have time to spare to answer questions there either. But there is always an answer there in case you feel you need one, just as there will always be people around on main to help with your problem. And you will not be able to comment in such a question, since Meta is not a discussion board. We do have a dedicated chatroom for meta discussions and it is a place where such discussion can take place: https: // meta.meta.stak ex change.

722,i was retrieving money and my card wouldn't remove,"['retrieving money', 'remove card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","retrieve money retrieving card?

It seems to me that both of the examples imply that retrieving something for a specific reason or purpose would imply the need to use a card. If i were to retrieve cash then i could do so from my pocket or wallet if i knew where the money was stored so i didn't have to open a separate app to do this.
On the other hand if you were trying to access some form of information, whether this was some kind of data, a form with certain information in it or maybe a database with a record of your transactions for the day, then a physical access device would make sense. In my opinion if something was only useful when you physically access it, it doesn't really count as an intent any more than just having an apple on your desk. 
For example, the ""play a track"" or ""start a movie"". I could open up Spotify, select a song, hit play and then go back and listen to it in real time using headphones on the train, so is this not the same thing as the intent to hear music or start a film?"

You can have multiple intents in a LUIS Dialog. If you'd like to add another intent you simply have to change the existing dialog in Microsoft Azure Portal. You can also use the same intent across multiple dialogs in an application.
If you want to do things with LUQAS there are a couple of ways. First, you can add one or more actions to an existing intent through the Dialogs API. Alternatively, to create an intent in LUQLus you add a new intent type to LUUS which is similar to Dialect but is a little more flexible. See here for more information."

I hope this doesn‘t sound too negative, but as a non-native speaker, it really bothers the hell out of many ESL/EFL learners that they don‚t understand the meaning of sentences and the meanings of individual words. That is why it is always a positive experience when you have a native speaker explain the difference between a sentence and a clause, or the two different uses of the word ""to"" in a noun/verb pair (e.g., ""he to eat the apple"" vs. ""eat the apples"" and ""what are you doing?"" vs ""doing what?"")

A:
You don't need to use an intent at all because if what you're trying to do is to tell it to get your ATM card, the at command does that, it also tells you how much money you have in your account as the ""how much"" intent.
The code you posted seems to be from an app designed to teach beginners about the Google App Engine. In particular, a common mistake beginner developers make is thinking they have to have a server running in order to build an AppEngine app, which is not true. The example that they give is of a game they make that runs on their server. I think you are missing the point and thinking that you need an server to run a program in the cloud, like Heroku. That's not correct. You can use the SDK to make a simple web based app without an actual server and deploy to the Cloud. However, as they mention, you do need a GAE project to create the code, or use a pre-existing one."

I think that ""ate my credit card"" is a clear case of a preposition not having a grammatical antecedent. It isn't clear what the ""grammatical"" antecedes is, but it seems clear that there isn t one.
""I am going to use my cards to... the... ""
It is unclear to me why ""use your card(s)"" can be used instead of ""uses"".  There appears to be a difference between the sentences ""I will eat my lunch"" and ""My mother has a lunch"". The first is clear; the second ambiguous. If you can eat a meal without it being consumed by you then you could eat your lunch. On the other hand, you need not eat the meal (or consume the food) before it is eaten. You can say ""the mother eats her lunch"", ""my mother takes a bite"" etc. But ""The mother consumes her own meal"" sounds odd (if not incorrect).
So if you are going for clarity it would be better to avoid ""at your cards"".

I would go with ""Give me my ATM card"" - it's a common phrasal verb, and you don't have to repeat ""atm"" or ""card"" (which you've just said in another sentence). The other two forms don’t really work without some other context - giving the card might not mean the same as “return” an atmal card. ‘Return‘ is a verb that has to be a bit different from ’give“ in that it carries the idea of getting something ”back„.

@Gille: It's a bit of an interesting one - you are absolutely right. My interpretation of the full sentence is exactly the same as your. But you could still see it as a duplicated question on the basis that the title (even if it says ""answer"" instead of ""question"") would be considered the only information that a user is interested in.

I guess you meant ""how to restore one card"", but I don't know. ""Recover"" would be the appropriate choice.

Thanks for your advice. I am currently doing an online course on natural language understanding. My goal is to get better, but I don´t know yet if it's possible to be better by asking what you can do in such cases. If that's the goal of your question, maybe I'm not the one who should answer. :)

A:

 What do you do when your ATM ate your card
   What you should do, given you're speaking to the ATM
(in informal speech), is ask, did it eat your credit-card? (or card-number), and hope the answer is NO.

 How many at the gas-station did you eat? If they're the same, you are safe,
 but if they are different, we might be in some trouble. :p
 (from the question)
Did you buy something at a gasstation? or did some other type-of-at-a-gas-st[...]

 Pay in your at-m card, it'll ask whether you paid with your own card or the credit one, or just enter the value. (I think there's no need for the ""in your"", because at is always there when you pay)

 Eat food/eat-in-my-g[...], the food will disappear as soon as you finish it. You can ask them"
739,atm still has my card,"['has card', 'has card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","had card at? my at has? have at card

The only thing I can think of is that all of them are correct in the general case, just different ways to say the same thing.
However, I think that the meaning changes depending on the context of the sentence. That is, at a glance, none of those looks wrong in a particular context, it seems (maybe even to me), but one of ""atm"" has a different meaning than the others. It doesn't seem to be wrong, but maybe that's just because it's so common. And I really don't know any other way to word it, so if anyone knows how to better word that I could do, that'd be greatly appreciated. I would even consider just a better way of writing the whole thing, although I know there is a certain way this is written, which is why I am asking. 
I don’t know anything about programming, and I've just been learning Python, as opposed to Java or something, for a little while, though I do know Java pretty well. If anyone would like to comment on that, please do. Thanks very much!"
740,what do i do if an atm ate my card?,"['ate card', 'ate card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","A:
It seems to me that the intent is one that is only triggered after an action, such as eat card, is performed. That being the case, it seems that you only have two possibilities: 
If ""eat card"" is a command, you can say that at the end your ata has the command ""did eat the card"". However, the ""what to do"" in this case seems unclear to be something that should be expressed by the sentence."
741,what happens if the atm doesn't give me back my card?,"['give card', 'give card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","Intent to take card.
  Intent to give back card
Give my phone back to atms."
742,i can't pull my card out of the atm help me,"['help card', 'help atm']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","The reason I ask is that I am trying to train a neural net for a question answering app, and the input format is not a natural language question but a series of intents.
So far, I've had to guess the right answer, but I want to build the system from the ground up with a deep net, so I'm looking for the intent of ""help atms"" and ""pull card"".
My guess is to feed the neural network two lists:
""i'm going to pull some money out, would you care to help?"" 
or   ""i have some cards, can you help pull them off?"".
What are the other options? I can do the latter but the former is more fun to ask.  Also, ""Pull your card"" is quite ambiguous when it's just a few characters long. ""Help at m"" vs ""at m"". etc. (And this is before I even consider that there may be other, more interesting, ints that could be extracted from this phrase.)
Also, is it possible to create new intent types in tensorflow? Or, given the fact that all of tf-idf, tf, keras, numpy, tensors, etc all work, am I going about this the wrong way? The best I could come up is using a dictionary that contains all possible answers. But it seems awfully inefficient. Is there no way to programmatically assign these intes? (I'm thinking something as simple as: ""If the first three letters of a phrase match A, then set the new inte to A"" (which is what a simple TF-IDF works on) but that seems rather complicated for just one intent...)
Or, finally, does the answer not really matter? It's a hypothetical app. I know there are more intenet languages for NLP, like Chinese and Japanese. Perhaps they're more natural for such questions and I should just use them. However, at this stage, it will be a learning exercise. In the end, no one is going pull cards out for me...

me, but if you don’t do what they say, they will come with more evidence. Can
I keep your credit cards or are they all yours? You're not getting any

744,why would an atm swallow my card?,"['swallow card', 'swallow card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?",", swallow money? and swallow debit card?, or is there a better fit, as in the first utternace is a lie and the other two are all right?

A:
“atm” is not a thing.
I’d say this is something which is being described, so “swallow card, etc.․‘‖
Your example sentence is just a list of things, it has no meaning. It does not have the kind of meaning that you can infer anything from it."
745,my card was taken by the atm,['taken card'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","took card?, have been taken? been card.

For my money, this is not the sort of question that is best answered using just semantic analysis: there is also the question of what you really mean by'my card'. If I say,
  'I lost my wallet; I went out to the car, and when I turned back 
there was a note on the door saying ""my wallet has been returned to you.""',  which may indeed be what happened, I may not actually be referring to an individual's card but a thing like 'wallet' that has a particular physical manifestation.  If so, 'taken card' may be more appropriate than 'have been took'. Similarly, one may have taken one's own card without thinking of the word 'card'.
If the card has an address, etc. on it, the context may help. I think in such cases, all three of these are perfectly valid, depending on whether you have a very literal view of your card or more of a view that 'what you mean is whatever the thing has actually been used for'..."
746,help!  the atm won't give me my card back,"['give card', 'give card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","I'm aware that the verb ""give"" is not very useful if I use the word ""card"".  The verb in this instance is used to communicate something about an object (the card).  It's more about the meaning of ""help"" in the context where that card was lost; in English, the same verb is more commonly used in ""Help! My friend stole my wallet when we went for a walk! The bank won’t give it back!""
The problem is compounded by the fact that, at least here in Australia (and maybe other English-speaking countries as well?), ""to give"" has a different connotation. In the example, it seems to me that ""the bank"" was ""giving"" back the card, even though no payment was made. I'm not sure that this makes sense, but it's how I'd have felt. 
So the question is: What, in these examples, ""was the intended meaning?""
Note: this would be the equivalent of a question like ""If somebody said 'give me the phone, help!' and I handed him the telephone""
EDIT:
@JohnDoe I think you mean ""Was 'help' used as a noun or an adjective?""  I agree that it can be used either way, with a slight but important difference.
""Help"" usually refers to human help. ""The bank is giving me back my lost card"" doesn't necessarily refer to the bank helping you, although it may. However the phrase ""Bank of England is lending £500k to help boost UK economy"".
In the case of the OP, since this question has been answered, I will accept John's answer. Thanks!
However, this has also brought up the interesting question of why the Bank of Australia didn't make the $50 payment for the lost ATM card. This is probably just a detail. It doesn‘t really matter if they didn‖t pay anything for it, so what I am saying is that I don‒t mind answering the original question. The reason for this is, of course, that if someone has their card ""given"" away (ie. lost or stolen) by their atmel, they should be able to use that ATM, or else it shouldn‚t be there. Even if"

The question you are asking is how to express the sentence in natural English. 
Needing new cards would probably be the closest to the English equivalent. For example:
I need to replace my credit/debit card with a Visa credit card and a Mastercard debit.
If you mean ""I want a New card"" then you could use the verb want. Here is an example of this:

How does the system know which intent to match the input to (it has no context, it is just an utter.txt file. Does it have an intent? Or an ontology?

I think I would have said 'Retrieve card' because it just sounds more specific. The more generic, the more likely you will have a problem retrieving that.
'Retrieved Card' - this is ambiguous. You have to look at the context of what has come before, to see if you can guess what the user intended. If you don't have enough context to guess at what they intended, then you get no match. It's not possible to get a match without context. In other words, you'll get an ambiguity error, or something like that - you know what I mean. So it depends what context you have. And you need to ask the right questions (or do more research about the intent) to decide what you are trying to retrieve. Maybe that will get you somewhere."

What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?",", open atms? etc etc. I'm not sure what is meant exactly by atmt but my intuition is that it's either an organization's card reader or atmcards (maybe both). So, is there something that works here? Or, are all the possible intents ""atmt"" and ""openAtm"" or what?
If you can provide some kind of context, it'd be much appreciated.

750,i was getting cash and can't get my card back,"['get card', 'get card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","get money?

If I had to guess, I'd probably say the last one because there are so many ways to get cash (I've given a list above). It is also an action that one would not normally associate with a ""get card"" intent (and, therefore, might require some sort of ""why?"").
I can think of two other alternatives:
(1) get credit
This seems to indicate that there is some kind of issue or transaction that can be done online. However, the context of the sentence doesn't seem to really indicate a need for ""online"".
A quick Google search indicates that the most likely interpretation of this is probably ""I was using cash to buy something that I am now unable to access due to my credit card having been revoked.""
The other interpretation is, of course, that it is something like a financial institution (i.e. credit) that has been involved in some transaction with the user's account and the transaction has not gone as planned, leading to the loss of access, thus the question arises: ""what is my money (in this case, my cash) worth?""
In any case: (1)(a) seems like the correct interpretation, although my confidence in it could be improved if it didn't contain a mention of credit.
Note however, since it has the word ""credit"", (2) would be the natural ""other"" choice. So perhaps an even better answer would just be: 1(b) or 2. I'm thinking (c) might be an option, but it isn't the first thing that comes to mind when one reads the prompt. It seems more like it would fit the intent of (3) which is: use money to do something, for instance, buy candy. But (4) doesn;t seem like an appropriate fit, either, because ""card"" isn;'t something you typically use to ""do something"" with money. (5) is a natural fit and would probably also indicate the type of intent the other question is asking. My problem with it however is that is doesn' have a clear connection to a money-related activity. The money itself is not ""doing something"", so (6) (get a card) really would mean ""getting a replacement"" for your card. This seems a bit odd, though"
751,if my card is trapped in the atm what do i do?,['do atm'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","Do I have a card?

It can be seen as one of the most basic utterances when you try to deal with an ATM.
This can also be done with other similar words that have no specific intent: what does he want? What does she want?, etc."
752,my card has been swallowed by an atm,['swallowed atm'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","The atam has swallowed my. The card was swallowed. Card has the swallowed swallowed it.

(2) I have swallowed (in the past) the card at an ATM machine. That is, I (have) previously swallowed the atame. In this case, the verb is past (swallowed), and the object of its action is (the card).
It is not clear to me if the first example is a ""past perfect"" tense, or an example of a perfect aspect. I think I've seen it used both ways. My dictionary (Merriam-Webster) says that it denotes a tense ""used to express the idea of an action started before another action."" That seems to suggest that the two verbs here are ""swallow"" and ""the swallowed"". But the other definition given for this use of swallow seems quite odd. According to WWWED:
""past"" perfect (also called ""retrospective"" or ""backward"") is used to refer to the actions, experiences, thoughts, feelings, and states or actions that took place before some other action. 
My questions: Is the phrase in the original example (1), above, a past perfect? If so, why? And, what tense does the second example mean?
Many thanks. :)
Edit: My example was wrong. It does not express action before other past action; rather, it simply refers to previous (current) state of affairs. But, in my defense, my definition of tense is probably wrong, so I welcome others' suggestions. Also, sorry for the late response. :P Thank you, all, for your input!
Update: I was right! That definition (from Wiktionary) that WWED gave is indeed quite right. Thanks. :-)
So, is this a true perfect tense? (Sorry to be so pedantic.)
And, does it have any significance? I'm tempted to say no, as there is no other ""perfect"" tenses, but I don't know enough about this area. Maybe someone can set me straight. If it matters, this is in English, spoken here in New York City. Thank-you all! :) Again, though, thanks! I appreciate the help! ;-)

I think the key to the answer is what a ""bank"" is for a particular person. For a native speaker, it may be obvious but what about a non native? I think a very simple approach is to explain what it means for you.
Example ""The bank I have at home, where I keep my savings, will give me access in 2 days, but it needs the card details. So if you can find me the bank's details, and tell me when you have found them, that will be much quicker.""
The person will appreciate you using their language and the ""simple"" approach and they should be able find it for themselves. And when I say simple I don't mean ""it's easy"" just that it's the shortest explanation. I'd add some small sentences like ""I am going to need the name of the ATM, your name, the branch, which branch it is, what branch is closest to you (I'll need this if they don’t tell you) and your address (address, city, region)""
It also depends on where you are and how much time you need. If you're going out, you might just be fine with asking people what bank you use or which bank they use. But you may get some strange looks if the person is going about their business and suddenly asks you ""So what kind of"
754,what should i do with my atm that got stuck?,['stuck atm'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?",", i got a stuck ATM.

This is a common situation when dealing with NLP. A common way of describing this situation is to use the verb ""get"" with a past participle as the predicate. For example, in the sentence: What should I do? I got lost. We can have several interpretations of the meaning.


1) To ask:
What should you do, since you’re lost?"

Intent Recognition: This example contains no explicit intent. Therefore, the first intent in the list is selected as the action, based on the user’s intents. Because of this, an intent that is not a part of an action is always selected. This is because this is an example where a user would ask about multiple transactions on an account, and not specifically a single transaction (i.e. multiple <transfer > actions). For this example, ‘account same as other transaction‘ is used. 
As a result:   account_same_transaction

I think that the ""have"" in my first case is a mistake, I don't know why I wrote that because I'm not sure what it meant. It means ""the payment"" which is not the same as what I mean.
My question is which verb would be the normal one? I just found it strange that my sentence didn't express what i wanted to express and I wanted someone to explain the difference. :)
Also if you can explain to me why some people said the first one is better, it will be very appreciated, thanks. I would like to know the answer as my teacher in linguistics told me that when you want to be a professional in language you have to study the grammar. And I've noticed that there's quite a lot of people that I ask questions and don‌​'t answer mine. Is it because of my English, for I know that it's a little bad. Also if there are questions that you'd like me to ask you that aren't in this page then post it. In the mean time I want someone with a more academic and more experienced in the linguisticaly world to answer my question :) thanks

It is not a typo, nor a mistake on behalf of the poster. 
Be can be used to create a passive construction:
What are you being charged for?   (or, What are they being charging you for?).
This is a way of speaking in order to express that the person or thing is being treated in or as a certain way, or to convey some sort of authority over the subject. In this case, the author of this sentence is saying that there is one expense that was double-charged."

P.S. This question is part of my work.  I will try to provide more context to clarify the issue later. (I am a new intern here)
Update:
Based on the comments, I have added a few sentences to the text above in bold to help clarify why a ""fund"" is needed. The original intent was simply to ask for a list of sources. When I reread it, in hindsight I think I worded it poorly. My current intent is to seek information as to how legitimate (or not) certain investments were made; i.e., I do not know the actual source(s) of the funds I'm talking about, but I feel I need to find out. I don't think there are funds to scam (unless the investments are fraudulent), but in my experience this is what I always hear after someone has lost money. So, the question remains: given the dialogue I've written, please help me find the most appropriate intent!
Also, this question will eventually be made available as a dialog. Here is a version of it in the form of an email (edited) that might help illustrate:   (This was posted originally without context.)
  Hello, 

  You may be interested in learning more about an investment that someone made about a month ago.

 The person who made the investment told me he wanted to be very careful, that he was afraid I might lose all my money, etc. He asked me a lot of questions, such as how old you were, what you did for work, your income (he told you could ""put in"" a little at a time), and so on. We met at Starbucks to talk some more, after which he told I couldn't get the information he gave me. Then, he asked if I wanted a check for $50,000"

Sourced funds.
I am also assuming that the funds are sourced on a daily basis. The question is to make clear if the intent is daily or weekly or monthly funds or annual funds etc."
763,i would like to verify the source of my money,"['verify source', 'verify money']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","I would assume that there is no answer here, as ""money"" and ""source"" are ambiguous in English language. However it seems to me that ""I need to see if this money was printed in China"".  I am not completely sure if that is right, I would be glad to correct that."
764,where to funds come from,['come funds'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","A:
*come funds
B: I want funds.
C: My funds are coming in. 
D: The funds will come in
E: *come from
The best-fitting intent should be D. D makes the least assumptions about where funds, or who has them, are currently from, and D is compatible with all of C, A, B, E (though it is not compatible for a different reason with E.) I don't know what it's like in Britain, but in the USA ""come"" (A or E) is used far more commonly than ""get"", and ""*get"" sounds a bit old-fashioned to my ears, so I would probably say A. Or, to be picky, ""where do funds/my funds... come"", or ""from where/which funds do...""."

What is more relevant here is that the question asks for the 'best fitted' answer, but we only have two options in the answer. Therefore, there can be no best answer because we cannot choose between two mutually exclusive answers. It would require some kind of a best of two worlds or best out of three scenario, something we do not have. There must be a third option that we don't know about, and we can't even formulate an answer to describe such a scenario."

(the following is a repost from the comments on this question in the meta site)
Verify source. I think in this case, it's not really clear. Either way, this is too broad. If it were really verify, the intent of the asker is ""verify that this source is legitimate"" - that's the first intent. But this could also be ""I have a list of sources, verify that the ones you see belong to me."" So we really need more context. Maybe you should ask yourself (in the question you have to post, or in a new question) ""what are my sources and why are they important for me?"" Then you can come here, post your ""why?"" and people can help you find out the right intent for this word. It might be: why did I ask about this? What do they have for verification? Etc. - I'm sure there's a lot of ways to ask that, depending on what you're looking for. Hope it helps you get started and makes sense. :-)
In short: ""is this my money?""
What do you want to do if the answer is yes? Do you care? (If so, I recommend adding a ""this is my question"" and explaining what it is).
""is/isn't this true?"" (or better, with examples) and ""How do we know it isn't a fraud?"" are good. Or ""do you mind if I add this?"" ""No, go ahead!""
If not, you could probably do this instead. And you'll want good examples. ""Are you sure you know how to add these?"" or ""Could you show me, please (with examples)"" or maybe ""could you write them down for the sake of your friend/employer?"" - maybe something along those lines...
Edit:
The OP asked for help to decide on the appropriate tag. My suggestion: it really depends on your intent to solve the problem. In this particular case I'd say ""sources"" (but the OP can always add a tag). But it also depends heavily on: What did you do in case of"

A:
‘I would see your [object]’s [action]

The reason is that, when it comes to inanimates, people often say

Also, is using a verb phrase correct with the question of check in a sentence such as: How can you check whether it was from a person (check sources) or money (checks source).
If there is not a single fitting term, how might I ask this question in other ways? What about, for example, check, source and source check? Is this a good way? Or do I need to come up with new, more specific terms? I'm looking for one phrase to do it all, so this would be ideal."

This question is answered not by considering the proposition expressed but by asking: how would I answer such a question? It would be in some sense a matter of how the world works in order to be able to respond appropriately to such questions as ""What is my source?"", with the idea that one's response should be appropriate to the question as it is asked.

It's not the intent that's important, per se, it's the information that you're verifying. If you know you can verify a credit/debit card, that information is sufficient. Credit card is not a very specific intent.
If you are trying to get someone to give you an account that they've already established, and that account already contains credit cards, the most common form is:
[VERIFY YOUR ACCOUNT]
You need this to make sure I can get money from the account, or you won't release it. 
So, given the above, what is your expected outcome?

The main thing is that the question doesn't ask us to provide a definition of the word, it asks: ""What does this utteration mean, given your understanding of how words work and the lexicographic definitions available?"". So we have to consider, which of these definitions of ""verified funds"" best answers our understanding, the definition in the ""lexicography"" part. I'll go by the way you asked the questions: you want to give the same answer to ""Verified funds""?
""Verify"" means ""verify that this is my money"". I.e. a ""check"" is just a verification of this claim.
We don't care who has verified your money, or how they verified it, as this doesn;t affect what the request means. Verification that something exists is not the verification that someone has been paying attention to it. This is why, for example, you don;'t ask ""where is your wallet"", but ""have you seen my wallet? I lost it somewhere""
In the case of a request for ""funds"", ""checks"" are ""a check for money"" as a whole. Therefore ""I need verified check"" requests for the money the checks represent. If there are multiple checks requested, they are combined into a single request."

@SV
I would say ""fund"" as well in this case and I would not use the present perfect tense. So the two main reasons for this are: you have used it with ""where"" and not with something that can be modified (so you could say: where did you found the money, or where came the code). The third main reason is I'd say the use of the preterite tense in English is generally avoided for something as ""generic"" to a human being as money.
You can find more explanations of this here: http://www.englishforums.org/general-conversation/
If you look for more details on using the perfect you can also go to the ""Perfect tense"" post on this forum
But as I said it is something to be avoided as much as possible. I also think the verb ""check"" is not a very natural verb to use in those sentences. You'd use more a verbs like to ""examine"" or ""inspect"" if possible (if you are going to ask for help checking it)
So it would be more like: ""Please help to check how much money has been used"". Of course you will have other alternatives to express the same thing. There is also the possibility to make a ""fishing game"" with a small budget

In English it's not really possible to have the situation ""the check has not been received""
Because that check does not get done! It gets ""checked"" (which usually means that your bank gives you an e-mail, with the details, etc) - not the cheque. If something was received by the bank, then there is no reason to mention it, except that it may be relevant to something in the story ("

In this article i will use a simple but common situation to show you what we will study in depth in the future: Where can I find my car key? I will explain first some basic concepts. The first is that we use verbs in order to tell something about objects, we must know what the objects we are talking about are. You can also use nouns to talk about subjects but this is very common when talking informally. I. e.: I do not need to have the money I have to give it to you. (I already have it). Where. We use ‘where’ because we need the information of where. If I say “I lost my money.”. Then I am missing a piece of information that is „Where is it?“. To answer this question ‚Where can you find it?‘ we have two main parts. Where is. Here we talk more about locations. An object can be in many places at the same time and you can talk ’where there is‚ to describe one single place. So ‒if you say that you have lost something ‑in the park. ‹Where there was› is a place that was in one point. In ‟here‟ we also talk of time. When you ask where you will find something tomorrow you are asking for the time you could find that object the day after tomorrow. A good example is when you talk to a police officer. He might ask you a few questions to get to where he needs to in a certain situation. II.e. you would say: ”You want to know where my husband can get his car repaired? Or when I can use my credit card again? or Where I was last Thursday.?. This will all be part of what you learn in this course about ‏locations‏. There are many ‪location words‫ and we shall cover them all over a course of several lessons. However, what is important to learn is to remember ″the order of words″ as I said at start.

Is it right to ask know my sources of funding? It’d be more correct to put the information you”re seeking in the question and let your sentence flow to that end. If you want to be pedantic, you can make it into a single question using the word where, with the same meaning as know, except you add the preposition:
– where can I get my funding from. 
If, in that sentence, funding is an abstract idea, where implies what you intend to do with it. You could also use where to express where you got the funding in order to imply the source itself.

.

A:
.
I think, and I may be wrong, that the phrase 'where does my income come from' could be used for both questions. It could therefore mean: 'I want to know the sources of my own money.'  For the 'comes money' question (in your example) I think that would mean 'How is my source of income generated?' (or, more directly: How am I paid?). For 'it pays me' it would seem to mean the same thing. I am not sure whether the first question could also mean, 'Where did I get my spending money?' I'm not entirely sure of the difference but, in any case, it seems reasonable to say of a rich woman that'she pays the bills'.
If, by'money sources' you mean something like'sources of funds', I would interpret 'is my' as meaning 'who are the people who put my funds into my checking account'. The second question ('I get money from') might thus mean (I'm guessing and, again, this may not be right) 'Who is paying into the bank account that pays my salary?' Of course, the question may also be rhetorical ('Where does money go when someone withdraws it from her account?')."

How do I detect what the context of such example utterances and then the correct intent?
If I can get an intent to be 'check funds' then it is a good example of using intent detection to solve some other NLP problem.  But this might be too simple, and the 'intent' here could be to ask for a list of the funds in our account etc. etc
This is just a small part of a more complex problem where the problem domain is finance & economics. But we still have a few problems, like, how to identify which bank funds should we be checking? Is checking funds from our own account, or checking our parents funds, checking the state funds etc?  The answer may well be context dependent. How do we handle that kind of situation? Is it a problem to assume a fixed context?  If we assume fixed contexts, then we need to know whether a statement is true in that context, e.g. if we are talking about a bank then is it necessarily true that funds are only checked from the same bank? I guess we may need a corpus which specifically defines which contexts are relevant. The above example can be handled by simply ignoring that we're talking bank or not. So we do not need any intent-classification for this particular corpus-context. However, we probably can't do this as we don't know which banks exist. Is that a real problem? Are we assuming that if a context is defined we can ignore it? Does the real world behave this way? How to deal with this? This kind is of problem could become too big, so that the simple 'fix' of ignoring the fixed-but-not-always true contexts would be inadequate in reality. In this case, the example will not be good for our purpose unless we know that our corpus has a definition of banks. Does that mean that it will be easier to detect intent in a sentence that has some context information, such as: ""My bank has funds for the amount you want from my account"" vs ""I have funds to spend"

How should I verify that what the tell the banker the amount? Should this be a matter of intent? 
Is this the same as: when my source is deposited and a transaction occurs at some point in the future,  tell my banker that I have this money? Is this not a verification that there is some source that deposited the funds to me? This intent seems to be more in line with my first idea, verify source, but this intent requires me to have something more.  The second intent is a statement that my money could come from this source in a future transaction. So if I want to know the true source (verify), is this second option more appropriate? I think this option makes sense, because to the untrained eye it is easy to tell if money comes from a deposit than a person. However, it does involve some additional work on my part. It is also a little harder to convey to a banker. If this is wrong, please let me know. Any help is appreciated, thanks. This question stems from my confusion with the term source verification.

You could be right. But the first option I stated is more clear and is actually my intended meaning. Verifying that it comes, is verifying that the money has come, or was the intent that, when this amount is paid, to check that this person had this, at that moment, source from which the payment was made.

I don't think ""I have funds"" means ""my funds are from another place"". I would think, given the context, that you'd say ""My funds came from""
This would seem even more awkward because you have to say that the money came first and then the person who gave it came. (It comes from someone who has money...)
So I have two questions:
1) Is it the intent of this question to find out whether the funds or the one giving them came earlier than the other? If not, what is your intent and why? 
2) In your opinion, does it matter whether you use ""come"" and ""were given"" or do you feel that either phrase will make sense to the listener? (I think that ""was given to"" has a different meaning from ""is given from"")
Update: A commenter pointed out that I didn't use a hyphen to go with ""from"". So I tried to rephrase with: ""Where does my - fund come - from"".
I also tried it with the phrase in quotation marks.
Both phrases give a slightly different nuance than ""comes from"", though the former has more of a suggestion of ""a place"" where the fund came, while the latter doesn't seem to carry this suggestion. In either case, both phrases seem awkward if you ask the question of someone whose funds you already have. So my question still remains: What should you say?

2) When was it established?  Are both acceptable answers, or is one better than two? If both are acceptable, is it better to ask ""when was established"" than ""how long has it been established""?
The same is true of questions. Should I ask
3) How much money do I get? or
4) Why do the rich get so much more than us? In the case of the money, how much is too much? Is it acceptable to write ""I get more money than you"" vs ""You get less money that I do""? Is this a grammatical distinction or an emphasis one? I know the latter one, but is that always appropriate? Or does it vary by context? For the reason, one would ask the former. And if you ask it ""How much do you get"", then it would be fine to answer ""less"" if that is a fact as well. That's one way to distinguish primary from secondary intent. Another approach would say that it's OK to use the present progressive, which would then be appropriate even if the answer was inarguably ""more than I would like"". In a case where someone wants to know why someone else was treated unfairly, it is better not to mention a specific number, because the speaker will get that information from the story, rather than from a question. But if it comes out that there was actually a significant amount of money given out, that's a different situation."

Replied by Jonas K: @Jonass K, that depends on whether'me' is also modified or not. The sentence means: 'I was accused of something I didn’t expect'. If the sentence has two 'i's it means 'two things' where the two things are I and someone. This makes 'them' and 'us' the only possible referents. If there is only one 'im' then the's' can only be referring to 'expectations', so the meaning is 'the thing I was expected to do was...'

I just had a look, in a Swedish lesson, to the verb ""bära"" (to bear) and its prepositions. Here are the options that you mention, but with some extra examples:
*I varburen (bear the accuser)
Expect to bear something?
Not an option, because it refers to expectations. ""Jag måste bäras till tingsrätten"" means ""I must take myself to court"".
""Jakten på jordlottarna har börjat"" does sound like ""The search for landlots has begun"". In this case, it would be wrong because they (the ""jordlotterierna"") have not borne anything. It would rather be: ""Eftersom jakt pÃ¥ landlotterna har inletts...""
So, as far as the original sentence goes, ""Bara ett par mÃ¶nster som gÃ­r i rÃºd och ro. Vi kanske kan komma lÃ ngere"", is better than the other two possibilities, which can be interpreted ""Only a few patterns that go round in circles. Perhaps we will be able to go much further""?
Another sentence that sounds good, though with a slight twist: I will bring/bring myself a glass of wine, is ""Vi kunde fÃ”ra lite vin med oss.""

For that, the only possible intent is to find evidence of why you were charged.

The first and third are the same, while the second is not the intended meaning.  If that were the only question, it may be possible to pick one of them arbitrarily, but if we were to continue the conversation, we'd probably say something like: 

 The amount they spent is too high. My friend says it is $100,000, when a regular table costs less than 10.
 What are you telling me when you say $10,900 is ""too high""? If 10, 9, 1, 0 are too low, then why can't $1000 be too large? I see nothing wrong with that.

But the point is that we're talking about the exact quantity of something, and not about whether the value is high or low. It's not a transfer-of-value question.

I can think of a possible answer:
If i have an intent of type need a fruit, with an uttering of i want an Apple, i can get an Intent as an entity for the intent. For the Entity, the question of intent is not yet asked for.
Is this way correct (correct me if i didn't get the point)?
My thoughts on the answer to your question
In this case, we need to know the name of the fruit in the language. The language name can be given in an Entity. If we have both name and type, then we can say: Entity type Fruit, Entity name Fruit 
and this leads us to the entity: Fruit
Now the problem with this answer is, is we know that the type and name are the same, so we could go for a more general entity name. A name like Apple or Orange or AppleOrOrange is a good idea. And this would bring the Intent with us. So the possible Entity with a question like i don't need any Fruit is: Apple and Orange
So, in this context i would say if there are 2 entities, for 2 different intents, it's better to have 2 Entities, one for each intent
Hope this answers to all the questions

However, I'm not a native speaker so I wanted to consult with native speakers before accepting my own interpretation.
Can you help explain if this is correct? Or is there a better interpretation to this question? Thanks.  
Edit. In response to @Brythan's comment, my question above is referring specifically to the meaning of this phrase ""can i..."". I know it refers to a specific verb ""receive"", but my initial question is about the overall grammatical structure of that sentence, not about how it relates to ""i can..."", i.e., what part is in fact the ""I"" in ""Can I..?"".

A.B. - Correct me if I get something wrong, but in general, the correct interpretation would depend on whether the verb was transitive or intransitive. The following is not correct if the action is intrinsic:
can I receive? -> the interpretation should use ""the subject as an object of receive, e.g., ""You can receive"" -> ""you could receive"". The above sentence would then mean ""Could I?"" -> Yes, in most contexts, you can. But this interpretation cannot be applied if there is an intrinsic verb: the second one can is more appropriate:  ""We can/could"" - the speaker cannot receive - it doesn't make sense to apply ""we as subjects could / could"" when"

Or are questions really meant to be 'answered in whole sentences' rather than arguments? That is, is 'how do you get $200 out of US dollars?' not actually asking for an answer in the format of:
'$200 is worth $1,600'
but instead asks for:   'The easiest way to obtain $20 of money in dollars' with the intention of then going on and giving an example of how to go about it?

I get paid weekly by my employer and I only get one week of salary. Do I have to report as income for the remaining days, in which I was paid, or can I just report my first week salary and not my last? (In most of the countries it does not make a difference as long as you do the math right. I'm a Brazilian)
How many times should one take their vacation? In my country, you can only take 2 weeks of vacation. If you work for 40 days/52 weeks/other number of weeks, then you take 20 weeks vacation every year. How many weeks could you have taken for each year of your job? Or in other ways of saying, will you get the salary for every 20th week? What about the people that work in a company where you are not getting weekly salary, are those people going to be paid in the same way as those who do get weekly pay, even though they don't? Do they still get pay for all weeks worked? That would be pretty odd.
Is the time you spend doing personal work a tax deductible expense or not? For example, a carpenter working on your house would only have taxes deducted from his paycheck for those days he was actually working in his shop/at home. Does that apply to freelancers too? Also, the amount he is paid is considered a salary right? Not hourly. Or if I go to a school and work on some books, I will have some time off so it's considered ""personal"" right, but I do that for my own education too, which is more like a selfless act of giving my time to myself to better myself. However, some people will pay some of these books to learn more, and it would not be a ""selfless"" act. 
And finally I would like to know how to pay my taxes to the State. My country has taxes which must be taken from your paycheck and the money given to you on that date for you to keep the taxes. Is this the case for everyone or does it depend on the number days the person is working? If someone works in 2 or 8 days a week"

Update:  So I found some more examples of ""intents"" in dialogue data that have positive scores but I'm not sure what they mean. For example: ""Can you order me another sandwich?"". This is an utternce from the conversation model. Should it be treated as an intent as well? In this case I would like it to return an Intent of type 'order sandwich'.
Here is another one I don't quite understand: 'I would love the opportunity to visit your country'. As of now, this would return a dialog act of'statement' for which the probability is very high. Is this correct? I am not quite sure how we should deal with such intants in our models but any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. :)

Given that it is more natural for ‘to pay’ than “pay for” for the transfer of money, what is this a „transfer of“?
The sentence may be read in different ways depending on the intended meaning. If the speaker intends ‑ as it may well be the case ‐ to ask whether something is possible for him, then the question is a request ‒ in this case a conditional request or a question of ‚can‘.
On the other hand, the sentence is not a real conditional sentence, and the reader may find the meaning of the entire sentence puzzling. In this sense † the intention of using the construction is unknown. The writer has failed to choose a suitable preposition.  In this sentence the word ’for‟ serves for many semantic roles. For example, it can introduce a verb. It can be used to convey a condition. ‡
A third option is that the writer uses the language of a market. He may try to communicate that a certain exchange or an exchange in general is in the offer. This means that he is trying to say ′if the currency is GBP I offer X exchange.‖ If you do this, you are actually expressing a wish as a statement of fact. You are communicating that what you intend to do if given GB£ is to exchange it for US$ at rate US$.
You can also use ‹pay› to mean ‣‹give‛. Your example has the same meaning here. However, •‮you could also convey that there is something wrong with the ”payment„. So when you use this word, there may exist many possible understandings from the text and it must be specified which is intended.

How much money will the transfer? How can he/her transfer it? Why? What should they transfer to you?

We can answer these questions based on the two models of transfer and money, which include the concepts of sender and receiver (Figure 2.1). We can also combine these concepts with other ones such as amount (what does the money transfer amount) and time period (when is it possible to send the amount), which can help us answer some more questions.
In this chapter, we'll study the semantics, pragmatics, and the pragma-semantics of the phrase what (and how) in English, including its use in questions, requests, orders, offers, recommendations, instructions, suggestions, etc. We'll start by studying how this phrase, when used as an object of a verb, can express a specific or universal fact. Next we will discuss the different aspects of time and place in the context of transferring money and what. Then we go through a variety of other ways to talk about transfer or money in general. The final part of this section will be dedicated to how to express that certain actions can or cannot be taken with money by describing what can be done, what not, or what others can do with it. All this will make it easier to discuss what we do in different contexts. Let's start with the most common case: asking for transfer. There are different words to answer the question: How should he transfer the cash? We could ask about the type, the manner, where, how (or even when) etc… These questions can then be used to describe what is going to happen as a result of these transfers. If we ask, ""What are we going do if you transfer him money?"" we can start discussing what the others may want. ""Do you want me to take you with me?"" is a typical transfer-related question. Asking why can lead to discussion about what's being transferred or for what reason. These will bring us to the next section: money-as-a-purpose concept.

818,what do i need to do to transfer my paycheck to my account?,"['transfer paycheck', 'transfer account']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","; transfer money from my bank to a new checking account; get money directly from an employer, without going through bank; I would like a transfer from checking to cash.

The best-matching intent is transfer to new account, and the correct slot is account. For example, suppose user A sends a message with intent: 'transfer money, to the new bank account' and user B sends the message 'I would lke to know what i can do about this'. Then B will receive the result 'what i wtil need for that transfer' as'money'.
However, the user might not use the exact intent you expected. That is, they might say things like: ""I want to change my credit card to another one"" or ""i want transfer that money to other bank"".
If you want the users of your bot to say ""do you need an account for this or not?"", try to add a slot to your model, so the bot can tell if the speaker has a specific account or if he wants something else:
'Do you have an existing account? [yes or no]' or 'do I have no account yet?'
In addition to 'intent slots', the API also exposes'slot values', which you can send as answers to intents. In this case, you'll be able to ask if they have money on some bank or their existing credit cards.

820,can i directly transfer my salary onto here?,"['transfer salary', 'transfer salary']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","; pay me salary here; give me a salary. 
What is meant: if you don't have the right to transfer funds, can you pay money or a service, without it being illegal? In your example I would say ""pay my rent"" but you can't actually just ""give me some money, for now, until i can transfer it"".   What about other services: ""buy groceries"" or ""rent a movie from netflix""?. Is the intent ""i want you to pay (or provide) me (something)""?
I also assume that ""it"" in your last example is ""the movie, or the meal"" rather than ""my salary, which i don’t have a right of ownership to""

A:
“Transfer” is very specific. It is more like “pay‘ someone else what I already owe you. I might do this if I‚d already paid you for an‖unpleasant service and donʙ want to continue giving you money.
It„s unlikely that „directly‡ means ‚immediately‬ as there is no ‘payment․‰›between you and the bank‹and they might‽ need‏ a few‴ or―many ”‸‛days‌′ to‮process‭ your request."

If there is a difference between the two, would it be better or worse for a speaker to use one over the other to make sure that people understand? (and if so, which?)

A:
The main difference is that'receive' means to accept something while 'pay' refers to monetary transfers. However, in this context, I doubt if there are people who would be offended in receiving a salary.
I suggest you use'salary' instead of 'have' when you intend to talk about monetary compensation for something or someone:

That car is my new salary for this year."
822,is it possible to deposit money in gbp?,"['deposit money', 'deposit money']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","(deposit money gb, depo money).

It is difficult to make a clear distinction between what may fall under the category of ""depositing money"" (for which it may be that there is no intent at all), and what falls under ""giving"" money. For the latter, the intent that I can see would be ""I donate money"".
In the case of an offer of a loan, where is ""the money""? Does it fall into ""money"" at the same time as it leaves me, or is there any delay in the money being the subject of the sentence?
My impression is that ""loan money/payment money is a fixed concept which doesn't depend on any kind of intent in this regard. In ""You should loan me your money"", ""should"" has the meaning ""would be appropriate"". But in ""Is it correct to loan money with interest to someone without knowing if they'll return it?"", ""knowing"" means having to ""assume"". If the person I give the loan to doesn’t pay it back, that would mean that the ""lender"" will have lost the opportunity to profit.
So, what is this ""intent-less"" concept of putting money ""in gdp"" and how can we express the action of loaning? If we can't, is putting ""GBP"" somewhere as a description of where the bank will deposit the interest the right approach, and if so, how to express it? What, then, about ""to gp""? Is it ""put money into gpgp"" or ""create a gg account at gpp""? 
And for a different approach to the problem, I have a very limited understanding of how the gpeaure is to be used. I assume it's to say where you will be using the funds, not necessarily (and possibly not?) where they will sit. Would it be possible, with a sentence similar to this:
""I will give you money to send to chile""
But the question is, would I want something like:   ""with chil"", since it seems to imply that they would actually send it to Chile. But then the context of who I am giving the gift to is missing. Or is my understanding completely off?  (or is English more like Chinese than"
823,i received my salary in gbp how do i change this to my currency?,"['change salary', 'change currency']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","In some situations, an utterment may be ambiguous or even syntactically ambiguous. For example, consider the sentence that begins i will call home tonight. The word home may, depending on its context, refer to a person, place, thing, or some other entity. Similarly, other common utterments are: I want to go home now. I like my car. How do you do? I’m sorry, I can‘t. This is an example of an “empty” utterances. Such an instance is not only an exception to the previously mentioned, however, it is also a very common occurrence. We often don‚Äôt understand why some utteration has been said; sometimes we are even unaware of whether such a statement is appropriate in a given situation. In the case of the examples provided above, ”empty utter‬ments“ are an especially common form.
To understand this concept better, we can turn to our native language. Most non-native speakers will agree that we understand the meanings of utter, as well as the grammatical roles these words play in uttering a specific sentence. However, this is only partly true. As we have learned, utter is used to convey a variety of meanings such as „act out„,‰‹speak›, and a number of other similar meanings. Moreover, in order to comprehend the meaning of ‚úutter‛, the interpreter must also understand which meaning is being conveyed. Consider, for instance, how a listener would interpret the sentences that begin You are welcome. You were very kind and thoughtful. He is a great doctor, He was always kind to me.‌‖ The speaker of these utterts is obviously conveying something to his listener that is different from the listener Ð s native, everyday usage of that word; however he does understand what is meant. If, on the other hand, he had said, For your information, my mother-in-law is dying, you would have had no idea what this sentence meant or that he is convecing something other than what would mean in everyday communication. It is because of this difference of usage that this word is considered to be ‘empty. A nonnative English speaker would"
824,how can my friend transfer money to me?,"['transfer money', 'transfer money']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","transfer funds? pay a bill? make a payment? send a cheque? give money as a gift?

Intent to transfer has a high degree of specificity; a degree that, in fact, is required. A degree such that it cannot be expressed in any other intent.
The same goes for ""make a donation"". But what of ""send money""? How can we express the intent in other words? Or for that matter, what about ""buy food""?
Can the question be put more broadly: what is a ""generic"" intent? And to what degree is it possible to express such thing in natural language? I am not referring to ""the"" generic intent; I mean a specific one in particular case. I guess there should be some theory for what the degree can be. 
For example, a transfer is, by definition, the ""move of money from the sender's account to the receiver's"", and it is therefore an action whose generic/specific intent is ""transfer funds"". So I can tell someone that I want to pay my rent by sending $50. The intent here is to move funds from my account into the landlord's. In some situations it may be the case that my landlord has already paid the debt by that stage. But a transaction is still possible. If he doesn't pay it, I'll call him to ask why and give him a new chance to perform that action, and if he does, then I move money into his account. Or I might not pay, since my $150 in rent is not that important for me. ""Send money"" is less specific; maybe I just wanted to show someone the receipt, or maybe a friend of mine wants to buy some stuff using money he sent me, but not necessarily to send something to a third party. And ""pay a debt"" means something entirely different, namely ""I want my friends to stop talking about me"". The degree to which ""give money/pay"" can serve as an intent seems to be ""almost none"". (It is quite the opposite of the verb ""ask"", which is more specific than ""offer"", or ""order"" or whatever. It is in the same league as ""write a will"".)
Another example is: I would like you to help me get a job. This is ambiguous, so it can hardly be a generic one"

The answer is ""send"". 
There is no need to say ""the best-fitting"" or ""among"". These are both grammatically correct in this context but they are not necessary.

Note:  The answers here have been useful, as they discuss the context and intent of the sentences. Thanks, guys! I appreciate and value the input and discussion in general.
Edit: The best answer, so far, is to simply go with whatever sentence sounds natural, and not make it overly difficult to answer. I think that would work best for anyone, in this situation. My goal is only to be able to distinguish between the correct meaning of 'depositing my pay-check to an account' vs an incorrect one. In other words, the only answer that is correct would make the statement 'How do  I 'correctly' deposit a paycheck in my bank account?'
Thank you.   (And as always, no 'flames and/or down arrows')
Update: My question is different than the one in the linked thread. Mine does not reference a 'bank account'.  Instead, it focuses on the usage of  'to'. As in, ’How to i, deposit/withdraw something from an/my account.‹
My question also does away with 'the' which is typically used with the word 'account'. My point is, i would like to know, when 'i' is used to indicate ownership, what are some alternatives to using'my', 'this', and 'our account'?
Also, 'My account/The account belong to us' and the like may work, since the 'object' 'belongs to' the speaker (not the listener).  Is this what is intended, or is there a better way in English to express this idea? If there were multiple 'objects', would the situation be better? E.g."

What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","How, when and where is a person expected to act or occur to achieve the intent: by phone in their car? or at one's home? in the office? over the desk? using a mobile phone? with others present? at the bank? on holiday? etc.
What do we usually say in similar situations. In general how do English speaking people talk about this in daily conversation? What are the variations? Is there a set of'standard terms' or 'canned responses'?

A:
You can use ""to get""/""to receive"" for any event that is ongoing at any time, whether you have done the action or not.  For a job, you can receive payment, or you could receive information (e.g., a paper from your mail, information via email) or something else at a specific time. ""I receive $200 on the 15th."" is fine in some circumstances; it means that you'll get your money on a day certain, while ""Can you cash me an ATM card? When do you expect to have it?"" is not really the same thing. But they can both be phrased as ""When do I get..."". It's also used with objects you do not own, as with ""We need an X by the 16th to meet the deadline.""  You could also use the past tense ""receive"" with something that has happened already, but usually that's used in different ways, for example: ""You received a notice for an emergency meeting at 9:00?""
The verb ""send"" in this context is used for a future event. Someone asks, ""Do you want to send me a bill?"" and the answer is, typically ""Yes, I'll let you know"". ""Send me the bill"" is usually a statement about a completed event; ""Will you send her that contract? We should send it to the CEO by Friday.""
In a business situation, there could be many ways to phrase the question depending upon the situation. Perhaps the boss asks you to ""get a contract"" by a certain time and you ask ""May I use your printer for that?"" or ""How many pages should I print? I need to print a lot."" In another case, perhaps the employer asks for some information by email, and then you respond with a link to an email"

We can try to determine this with a simple search: Why is there no transfer for [john] in [wikipedia?], or Why doesn't John have [transfers]? or How does John get [his transfers]. For this we'll need a search that can answer the question in English (and any other language) for all entities of the same form as [entity].
For the entity John, there are four different types of entity that we can search for: John. First, the John entity:
why-john-not-transfer
This query finds no results. Second, we have the more specific entity, John: john, which also returns no result. Third, using an entity search with the term John returns the correct article John Smith. Finally, for entities that are people, it is also possible to use a hyphenated version of a person's first and last name, and use their full name in the query (e.g. Why-can't-I-go-to-the-doctor?).
So there is no good answer to the ""why didn t my"" or ""transfer go though"" question. The best results are only available by using specific entities. In any case, without knowing the actual entity you are searching for, searching Wikipedia won't be helpful since a query like Why does my entity not have a [transfer] is ambiguous, i.e., it can mean several different things depending on the context.

What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","If the correct answer is that there is no such intent. Then the sentence has meaning. It is a mistake to try and assign a purpose to every uttering that has a meaning, since it would quickly become a hopeless task to list all possible meanings. The meaning of i try to and i did are equivalent.
So I believe the most fitting answer would be:
In this case, it is impossible for you to know the meaning you are speaking to, because the question being asked is not a question of fact, but of inference. In the world of natural language the concept of 'fact' is an oxymoron, which may seem obvious to you, however the fact that the statement, “I tried hard,” is grammatically correct indicates that even the linguist does not know, what the speaker intended to convey, and thus the language user does as well.

Which one is less specific or more general? For eg. in the bank statement, I am supposed to pay only $50 for the transactions in last 15 days, what does that mean to me? Can I pay it as a ""transaction"" or a part of my ""banking activities""? Is there any difference between ""a transaction to a person"", "" a transaction from a company to the person ""? What does it mean? Are these different or thesame? Is ""person"" here just a synonym for ""the bank""?  Does it have any other meanings in English grammar? I read some books like ""Grammar in use"" by Prof. Richard W. Comrie and it has a section called ""The Meaning of Person"".  There it states : Person can be used as singular or plural, and as subject or object. In most contexts, person can refer to one. For example, If you say John is coming to London, then John, the man, will come to England. If however, you are saying how many John's are coming (as in John Smith came to this party), then you should use the plural.
How do ""people"" differ from ""persons""? (In general sense, please don't answer in context specific). Why is it ""we are talking about person and people "" but not "" we are talk about people "".

durango2000's answer has a number of important points that aren't really addressed or discussed in the original post. I hope to cover some of these: 1) that there is indeed a difference between adding money to one's wallet and adding it to a bank account; 2) the ambiguity that duranguo2000 talks about can only be resolved by context; 3) what is said and what one intends to be said; 4) a word's context determines how it is interpreted; 5) how this interacts with negation, conditionals, and the like. Here is my attempt: if someone says ""i'm short money"", you would assume he/she is short of it. If someone responds with ""but I'll give you extra money"" or ""you can borrow me some"", then it's assumed that she has extra that they want. But, the response can also be ""I can't lend you money. Please ask my friend for it"" and ""it's not possible"". In the case of the last option, it can be assumed the person is saying that their friend is not willing to give them the money; it could, of course, also mean their friends is too shy to do it for them. In all these cases, we are assuming that what the speaker means is ""yes, go ahead,"" whereas ""no, you can ask someone else for your money/lend it, etc."" is assumed. It seems to me that the latter option would be less likely to happen in most cases though. For most people, ""can I"" questions would probably be understood as questions about a situation where the respondent doesn't"

it is a bit ambiguous and it can be hard to figure out what the exact meaning is. The closest meaning in Google that i can find is ""transfering funds""
The ""transfer"" in the question has nothing to with the ""to"" or ""of"" which usually go with things like ""move"" rather than ""send"" - if i want to move something from one account to another. (e.g. from my checking to my savings)
So it's not just a transfer. If i wanted to say move (or transport) something to (something other than me) i would usually use ""mover"" not ""trasfer.""
If we look at the different ways ""money"" can get moved we get:
tranfer - moving money between accounts
transfer - the act of moving an amount from a source account on one person/account to a target account, on another person; the amount of money is not changed. Also: move, shifting, transport. Compare with: moving, transporting, relocation. [1]
trans - shifting a portion of oneself to the care of something. ""I'm sending him some dough."" - ""We're sending them $10."" [2] Also (with the same meanings as 1st, 2nd and nth) in: to give, to send, for sending. Note also: transfering, transferring, transmuting. For example: You're transferring your money to your account for the year. - you're transfirming your deposit (transfing a deposit is transfringing money) [3] Compare: transposing (transfer) and transacting (do a transaction) (see #3).
[1]: https://www.thefreedictionary.com/send
2: https:/ /www2.merriam-webster. com/dictionary/trans
3: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition
And then there's the one i use (from the Cambridge dictionary):
to send

PS: To make things a little easier, I've also attached a few examples.
Examples of the above:
Intent
-I understand, the process is
1) transfer
2) the transfer of funds from A to B
3) has been transferred
4) is understood
5) from her account
6) to her money
7) my money was transferred to another account - it's still mine
8) transferred it - we've transferred our money to someone else.  
Example with a prepositional object
The process of transferring to A is complicated. - (not a very good sentence)  - I don’t understand how I am to go from one bank to the other. It takes time, money and it is done at odd hours - is it that hard? - No, there are different types of bank accounts. I could go to any of them. This is what you are getting at. The money will be transferred. She would like to transfer the account from the bank which she is in now, to that of her own - she should go and open an account with the new one. In this case the intent is to understand. To transfer money from an existing account in one place to an open account (the bank) in a new place is transfer. But not all money transfers are this simple. There may be transfers that happen through brokers and other middle grounds which cannot be explained in this simplistic manner. A better example of this is if she has a bank account abroad and she wants to send a gift from there then the gift would be sent to a specific country. And the recipient has to fill in an application and then a certain type of certificate gets sent. All this would require an entire new discussion."

My issue may have been a bit too broad. I think that there are a number of other intenents that fit well for what I want, but it's hard for me to narrow down what exactly I need, so I ended up just making it a new question. The following is a list of what seems like a reasonable list:
comprehensive transfer

{
   ""intent"" : ""bank_account_add_funds"",

Am I understanding NLQ correctly? I.e. I can only use the NLUS to get an intent that is valid in the general case, but I shouldn't try and extract an invalid intent from the output? Or am I missing something? If so, what is it? The NLUs are only trained on the specific task I'm doing (which works, and I know I'll get a specific intent) but am not sure whether I should still consider NLu to be 'correct' in some general sense, or should I just use a more explicit way (like manually entering in a number)?
Thank you in advance for any thoughts!
EDIT: The only intent I need to support is bank_Account_Add_Funds (and no one ever said anything about other accounts)
Here is my NLQL:

""intent"": ""BankAccountAddFund"",

 ""intents"": [  { ""value"": { },
 ""confidence"": 0.955,

As you can see, I've already set it to return no intent if I don't find the value I am looking for.
So I guess my question, is, do I really need a 'general' intent with no specific value that I will never use? Is the 'bank account' value always going to come up and will the confidence be high enough to pick that up, even if the other things I ask aren't correct? Should I even try?  I mean, there are times that it doesn't come out at all.  What do you all think? This seems very brittle to me, as I only want to deal with one intent (I don;t need any of the others) and if my intent is misconfigured there is no telling that the rest of it will be too...

@M.M.: I see, but what about ""I would transfer $300 from the savings account of company X to the checking account""?

Péter B. SzabóJan 26 '14 at 14:57
Szabò: What? You mean the company's account?? Why? If it is, you would say ""The $500 from [company's] account is to be transferred to [my] checking"", and you don't need to say anything about the ""other bank"".
I have a friend in business, and he said that if the account belongs to a company, it's very unusual to have it both on ""my account"". He said he would put ""his"" in quotes when describing it that way.
And for ""transfer one money to other"", you can't ""have it in your hand"", so that means in a deposit (or withdrawal) bank accounts. If your friend says it like that, then it might be the only way to express it. Otherwise you have to describe it, by ""move"", like ""the $1000 I've already transferred was to some other place"". Or, like with Mariusz, put the word ""to"" (and maybe the other one if there is no money in the second account, or it doesn't make any sense)."

In terms of ambiguity this example is not very good as it has 2 different intents (see section 4.4.1).
The intent of account is:
I want my bank account information
and the intent for money is
i want money i have in my wallet
or

This one would be ambiguous as you can either tell your bank information or you are requesting your money that you have. So you should not accept it as one of your Intents. And this answer does not give you any hint what he is looking for. This is why you want a list of examples. They have no ambiguity. You can easily understand the intented of this intent (account).

The Transfer intent is for transferring money from one account to another account. This is used in order to send money to your friend. In order get this to work you need the permission from your bank.

What is Transfer Account Number. The Transfer account number (TAN) is a unique identification number that is provided to the customer on account opening and allows you to initiate or authorize transfers to and from your account.
For example if you want to withdraw cash from an ATM that belongs to your credit union you must have access to a TAN. Without it you'd be unable to do this because your TIN doesn't match. You get your first TU Number after your opening of the account and once you use your card in the ATM you get the second TUN. It can be anything, but most banks use sequential numbers like this: T01001123. Your bank will have a standard range for your second and first numbers, however they don’t have to. Also they use a different range than the third number, the TII, so for example T11, T22 and T33 may be used. A credit card TARN has two numbers but is issued by the issuer. Usually T3, or T2, etc. is used for the first number. There is no second number because the card has only a single issuer (your issuer) and a credit score. In any case, your bank has the number for you and you shouldn't need to know it. But, you may need the numbers for other purposes, for instance, when setting up auto-debit to take out cash. Or when your merchant asks you for them. For these, it pays to be prepared. We'll get to those below. Note that the above is for cards that are used in person or over the Internet (VISA, Mastercard, American Express etc.). If you are using a prepaid card, which don't have credit cards attached to them, there is an important difference. This is described in an earlier part of this series called, The Tarn, and the Card. Prepaid cards have only what is shown in this picture, no first account numbers. They need only an identifier, such as the serial number and they can get more than one. One is set up when you first make a purchase with the prepaid debit card. If this is not done then you'll need at least two to set it up properly and make it"

The best question is what the questioner intends to do, and the answer depends on that.
What the speaker intends may be: top off the card, transfer $10 to the main account, or do some other action. 
There are other factors: is it a one-time action, are the funds available to be transferred immediately, do I need to have the account number handy, etc. So the better question would be ""can you top it"" or ""Can I top that card"" -- with a few possible followups. (e.g. can you transfer the last $5 from one card to another card?)

I'm going out on a limb here and guessing that this is about using an online bank account to transfer money. The intent of the bank is to receive money, the intent here is probably for a customer to deposit money into their account. I'm guessing you have some kind of bot-like interaction with a human operator that is performing a ""transfer"" on behalf of a user.
It would be helpful is you could provide some more detail of how the bot is structured. It also sounds like you're trying to predict the next intents that might be in the user's mind without taking the time to look at all of them. That doesn't sound very helpful to me, and if I were advising a business that wanted to create some sort of AI for its customer service I would probably focus on making the first intension as accurate as possible and let the other ones fall into place as best they can."

I think it’s pretty clear what you need to top-up. I would argue that the second and third intent are not the same as the first. There are some other things in between too.
Let me be clear though – none of these are what” the question asker really meant
In this case the right intent is:
“How do I top (or refill) my bank card  ‘account?     
The question is about banking, not some app that does that.‍†‌ So there's an important difference between ""how do you top X?"", where ""X"" has been given, and ""How can I make my X work?"". This is not about how to buy things.  That's about ""make""
†I'm assuming here you want to refill your wallet, or bank account. If not, that's fine: it's just not what the OP asked. The OP may have a problem and ask what to do in that situation later. But not right now; the problem may be something else entirely
To your first question. Top cards are things like credit cards. Refilling an account is just the opposite of top, but it doesn't have as strong a connection as refilling a physical bankcard. It's more like to ""fill"" a bank balance or ""top-off"" your bank or credit limit or whatever. (I would guess it was the intent here, given the context)
For ""What is your current balance?"", that would not be my first guess. This would be ""what is my current account balance?"".
(The OP has edited the title of his question, so it is now ""Top-ups to a card with a balance"". The title is irrelevant, though, for determining the intention. Also, he says that he's using a credit-card, in which case ""card"" is a reasonable word to use. In general, however, one would say credit, debit or prepaid card, since those are the kind of cards that you can top)."

I am looking for a service that offers money laundering in USA. Is there any money transmitter companies that offer these services? I found this: http://www.transferdirect.com/en/index.html

edit: The money has already been received to my current bank. Now it's only transferring it into a new account that I opened and the process will take a couple of days. The amount is only $50. So it doesn’t matter if some other person will check out my account on the other side. My concern is about transferring money without leaving a record on both sides, so no other human needs to know this operation has been performed. Only the receiver needs a transaction in his bank, and no one needs any record of the payment. Any automated way of sending money is okay, even if you pay $1 to use this service. If there are not any services, please write it down, how to achieve this. Thanks. :D

You should consider using the intent addMoney to be the top-level intent for the current document in order to avoid getting into a scenario where you might use addAccount and get addFunds, only to learn that the user actually meant to use the add Money intent.
- In case you want to restrict it so that only the person who owns your bot knows whether they are logged in or not, I would suggest adding a context variable called bot_is_logged_in and using if statements to decide what to do. Here is how:
var context: {
  bot: (() => { var context = new dialogflow.Context; return context })(),
// Add some variables that you would need in a web app as well,

How do we know that it is not possible to perform dual transfers? Is it a common or unusual use case? What are the other possible ways to accomplish this? I understand that this scenario is possible as well: How to transfer money from a different account using Stripe on Android? 
What is meant by a single transferring is: transfer X amount of money to Account 2, from Account 1.
For example, let's make these assumptions:
Account 1 - 10,000$
Amount to Transfer (from Account1) - 4,999$   =>  10k$ to account2
Assume that account1 has 4k in a checking account:  (4,200 + 2x400$)
Would it be the correct intent? The only difference is that the amount to move from an account will be different from the one that we are moving to. I believe this is different than the dual scenario.  Please let me know. Also, I will clarify with some example inputs. Thanks!
This is an intent handler, so we can assume Account2.js  contains the method that will return either the successful or failed event. Please comment accordingly. The method is returning successful event, but there are no funds transfered to other accounts? Why? Shouldn't they be transferred? Thank you!

@Jefrome : I'm sorry, this was not what you asked for. So I removed it and replaced it with something that actually matches your question. I can edit the original one if you would like. Please leave a comment if it needs a replacement!

It's been almost one year since I asked this question, and I still can't figure out how to find the most accurate/succinct intent. The only intent that seems to work is ""Need Transfer Account"" which is a pretty obvious one, but I get no results. Any pointers are appreciated. Also, I don't think it's really fair to compare ""easy"" questions and answers. If it were, none of the questions we have would be easy! I think they are easy to answer with no effort, while some other questions are difficult to explain. Maybe it is more of a ""best"" question because I didn't find a good one. :P

What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","transfer? i am moving? How would you use it? The following examples represent the four intents above. Transfer Money to Account: I transfer $1,000 to John Doe's account. In the Money domain, I'm the only actor involved in the transaction. Money.transfer -1.0 -0.7 0.1 Transfer Account to Money: How do I move money from my bank account to his account, in case I do that? Money_transfer_money_account -15.4 -6.6 -14.3 Money Transfer to Transfer: Can I send $100 to Joe in exchange for $110, please? Transfer_to_Transfer Money transfer.

Transfer a number of money, using this transaction type. The money transfers can be specified by amount or by the balance of the destination account (if different from the source). This is a very flexible method of sending money between accounts. For example: To Transfer $10 from account A to account B: MoneyTransfer money.A.10 -10.00 Money A -> B MoneyB.MoneyA. 10.001,10 0 To transfer the total sum of $200 of balance in account C to the account D with the same label: moneyTransferMoney.C. 200.000 Money C -> D Money D. moneyC.200 -20.002,20
. How to transfer funds into a different country? Example: Transfer all funds from USA to Australia in US Dollars. To be able to perform a transfer into another country, the sending account must have a label, as well as the receiving account which will be the recipient of this money (i. e. label=Aus-Australia). We can see the effect of label by executing this transfer (we can also see in this example how the label is used for a better interpretation of transaction types). moneyA -> Aus-a moneyB -> USdollars. A. Aus -.20 -5.02,02. Usd A - 10 0
To transfer more than one country: We need to repeat the operation using other countries as destinations, for example we can do a money flow between Spain and Italy.

Hi,
That is exactly what I have thought. I haven‟t found anything like it as of now in data and if I can find it I will be more than happy to share it, but this sentence, as it is, could mean many things. And it could even be a typo. So it„s not easy, and I‣m not sure it makes sense either. But it would seem to me that it must be an action with a specific object and that is something we can learn from the context, from how it was used, in what it has been used in, etc. There is a lot of data here. Maybe we could make an attempt and see what happens. Thanks so much for this question. It is very insightful and useful. If you need help to get started let me know. Best wishes, Mona. Hope that helped."

Thanks in advance
(I'm a non-native speaker)
[UPDATE]
After looking at a few more utterces, I came to the conclusion that the correct intent for work is to do something for somebody, or for an organization. Work-to can be used to talk about the activity you are doing with somebody else, to give it some attention to somebody (to work on something or to fix something), not to make an experience. But the word experience, used at the beginning of the clause, implies something you will do for the other person or the organization: an internship, a service, you'll go to that city for two weeks to get experience about that. In this case, it is not correct to use the work verb at all. I also found work with work -experiences as it can imply a whole list of services or activities that can also be done with some other verb, and it's ok with this verb too. For example, with these sentences: I will work in my experience with computers. He'll work an exchange, but there is nothing wrong with working in computers too, because the verb that comes after is working, as you're doing some service with your experience (your computer) or doing something on your own, not somebody elses (for him, he will fix his computer, for us, we are going to a school to learn English).
To conclude: yes, working-with-people works, the problem is that it also can mean something different to 'work' as I"

viewing this in terms of the FOL (Fuzzy Logic) is a better approach that looking at it simply using the ontology. The intent in the given sentence is 'i want my bank to transfer the money' so the correct answer should have the intent of banktransfer or transfer. This is just one intent out of other possible ones. There are many possible values for such a statement that are valid answers.
It is always difficult to say what is correct and what not. To me the more correct answers is not only the one which fits the semantic content of your given sentences but also the most appropriate one. For example you can also have:
intent=bank transfer to handled
or
i have some money to my accounts
which is better than
accounts=topped up
because of its appropriates value. In other words it makes more sense. It is important to remember that in fuzzy logic there is no right or wrong and the answer might be just 'apparently' correct. But it is up to you to decide which answer is more proper. And there may be more than one answer that satisfy the above sentence. As an alternative to the last sentence i have a bank balance, there are others such as: (there will be many more such examples)
balance=balance
available=available
transfer=transfer
etc. etc. So to me in this case it seems the statement is ambiguous as it can not tell for sure that what i would like to do is to top up or to move some amount of money. If the question is how you interpret the sentence, then it should be asked in an academic way. A sentence like 'what should I say to be correct' is also ambiguous and may not have one single answer. I believe that the ambiguity is inherent and there can always be one or more interpretations. Hence, to make a sentence unambiguous is very difficult. Fuzz logic does not help in making such sentences unambigious for there has not been any real study done in using fuzzy method to resolve the ambiguities in such complex human language. One way to reduce the level of ambiguity in your question, you have asked is by making it more specific by providing a context. Context is what makes the meaning of sentences. An example"

875,how can i transfer money to my account?,"['transfer money', 'transfer account']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","transfer funds account transfer currency? money money send money. Which of the above are the most likely, and, why?

I have read that the answer depends somewhat on context and that context is context specific.
The context I'm considering is an online bank. A user of that bank (the ""client"") sends money from the client's account to a user that is ""outside"" the bank in some foreign country. The money is sent to the foreign user's bank, which in turn, sends it the the recipient's foreign bank account. I can't figure out why the last part is done. Why would the transfer to be the same type as that of a wire? Is it for fraud prevention reasons or is there something else? The same goes for all other transfers and the different types of money transfers. Is there an intent that applies to all of these transfers? If so, what is that intent? I am looking on the money side of things. In this particular situation the user is sending money, but the problem is more generic I think. 
Here is another one to throw in and see what kind of answer you come up with:
What is a transfer of funds within the banking system, as in an internal transfer? What are some of its common scenarios, especially in the context of sending/receiving money?   Why is this transfer more common to banks compared to other sectors? Can you give some examples? In which way do internal transfers of cash happen? And what about cash on delivery? Are internal cash transfers always done in person? Or maybe not? Please do not get hung up on this question. It is really more broad. Thanks. :-)
Also, is it more or less expensive for the sender to transfer cash to an overseas bank compared with for example sending that money through a bank that operates in that country? Why? How is cost affected by the type of transfer, the method and type or transfer agent? Any other thoughts/comments or corrections welcome. :-D
Edit: I would also be interested in general transfer cases. Are there situations where one is preferable to another?

Edit: I was thinking that it was probably give this card and that would just mean ""I want my card to be used for this purchase"". But maybe I could use give that card or maybe give my new one to this person as a way of saying I wanted that my old card be a replacement for some kind of a ""give this gift/give that gift"".
What do you think? Are the intent meanings I've given above ok? I am asking about the meaning of give in regards to the context of this question, not if I have a valid card that can be linked. (I think that might be more a question for another question though.)

P.S. Thank you all for the answers, I will go with give linked card (or gift)
(I just can' get my mind around not using the linked one as the gift, because that implies that this is a one-time purchase, and the link should work for any purchase on any card, right?)
But it's really hard to find an explanation for why the ""gift"" one can only be given to someone else, whereas the first one (linked account) can simply be purchased for me or a friend or relative or the like. So I'll probably go ahead and just take all the advice and try it out, see what happens. But I really like the fact that you guys have explained this to me. Thanks!

I think that I agree that they all would make sense as they would not be grammatically incorrect, however I think there is room for interpretation, I would say that the first option is probably the most correct and I do think the correct form might be add {the card name here} to {your daughter here}, if not then the other choices are fine, they should all work, maybe they aren't the right choice, perhaps I'm missing something. If the intext were different, eg add a family card or add my niece's favourite card, then they can't all be correct or at least I can see why they might not all technically be. Hope this helps, happy to clarify if it needs some further explanation. :)
Edit:
If you do have another card type for the contact on a'my daughter' card maybe just use add contact or contact {someone} and the name of the kid on that other card. Also you can use something like add '{card name} for {daughter name'}
EDIT #2: Thanks for your response, this is great. I've added them and can now use either the add or the 'add_contact' phrase, depending on my situation. Thanks again
@Mark Trapp, Thanks, you are correct that you could replace {cardname} with {add the new card's contact name}, however if this doesn't seem like a good choice to use, that is fine for me, thanks!
My only real concern is, should I always use the same contact? For example, say my family has several daughters, all with different interests. Would it be appropriate to say, 'Add my daughters favourite hobby card'? or 'The card my {naming} daughter will enjoy'"

relevant to multiple classes. The classes to which a
document is relevant must be specified as part of the
data. In this context, the document is considered relevant
to the given class if it contains at least one of
the words specified in such a way that the text
extracts the specified words.""
This is not my definition of intent. Rather, my question is: given an utterances (or a document), what is its best fit intent? What if there are multiple best fits? How does the system decide which intent should be selected? This is important when using the intent in document retrieval. For example, it is possible that a system decides to retrieve a set of documents where some of them will be relevant and the others are not. Therefore the retrieval is done based on the decision from the user. Is it possible to know, from a single utternce, which are the most suitable results for that utterence? In some cases it would be sufficient to just know the ""best"" or ""most probable"" intent of an utterence. Other times, I may want to be explicit to show the reader what kind of results I am expecting. So, in my view, having a precise method for deciding what the intents are from an ""utterance"" (documents) can be extremely useful. Does it make sense that for a given document there can only be a ""single"" most appropriate intent or many ""possible but equally appropriate"" intants? My concern is whether ""more or less"" a clear and unambiguous answer to these questions can ever be given. Please feel free to edit the title to reflect your opinion better. Thanks.

888,how do i top up my account with a cash payment?,"['top account', 'cash payment', 'top payment']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","And what is their best semantic fit? [1] [2]

This is not an easy question to answer.
It is a question of semantics, of context. As with most semantic questions, the answer depends on the context of the sentence. 
The answer to the first question, as written, should be that the word ""top up"" here implies ""to use a payment method"" to ""increase or replenish"" and therefore ""transfer the funds"".
In this case, that would mean that there is an ongoing action in progress that needs ""refilling"". There are three options here:
1: The account already contains enough funds. There is no need to transfer the account, but rather to change the amount that is being used for that transaction
2: A payment is currently taking place. The money is leaving the system. This is ""used up"". The user can top-up the money again. Note that this is only valid for credit card accounts. A cashier would not take your money and say that it needs to be added, because that's not what credit cards do. Rather, they charge your card and then you get charged back. So this can only be used if you use credit. But I guess you'd know if that was going on for real, and you wanted to use that. Otherwise it just sounds silly. :)
3: There isn't currently an outbound payment to your account. You will need a credit account to top it up or you can ask a friend to give you cash. Or you have to wait until the next transaction and it goes out to you. And you probably don't want to do that, unless it's to get money back from your bank that you think is too high. ;)
Note that all of these can be done in cash too of course. I just used that to make the question more clear. Also, note that while you might be able to tell if your out of money, you may be paying at a high amount but the merchant may not know the total cost. If you are only using a percentage of your credit limit, then the cash merchant wouldn't need the additional information. It is probably best to avoid this situation in all circumstances."

You are right that the use cases for a slot value are not very clear and should be better defined. We can try to do this by thinking about use-cases. I’ll assume for the rest of my answer that we”re talking about the top-level “Slot Machine“ slot.

from the question:
i'd rather use this kind of method to determine this, however, there is a slight possibility that there may exist a user who is more interested in the cash than in playing the slot machine. how can we find these people? are there any ways? what would be the ideal situation, in this case? for example, we can assume that they will prefer ""slot"" rather than ""buy"", but this is probably an over-generalization; what if there are more ways to find slot than to buy? this example should also be made more specific, because it's not really clear from the example that you were talking to the user. in general, slots tend to be used to spend money more than buy items, but you could try using a more granular intent and see if it works better for your domain. we'll ignore the specific question of which intent for this slot and try a different one. you mentioned an intent to ""pay"", so how might we express that in slots? we could use a ‘cash‘ slot as our base slot, and add one for each of the other options (‚slot‛, ‚buy  [item]‬, or ”›„‹[action_name] [argument1] ›[argument2] ›‖). it‟s important to note that using slots is not just intended to get information in, you should try and express the information that a specific slot provides clearly. if a visitor has already expressed an interest in „buy [item]"" you shouldn't be able to ask ‹ how much money do you want to save?※ ′‒ the intention is clear, so this isn‡t the most likely candidate. ""How do I save money?"" isn't clear"

How do you handle the case where the user might have an implicit intent of a phrase like “what is it?” as in ‘what’s that? or, even ’what the hell?? as when an actor is asked about an object and says, ” what, that!? „ The user is often wondering about the object in a way that they are trying to find an answer, but have little understanding of the context of that question. If this is your situation, your intent is likely ‚ what? †, as opposed to ‛pay check‘.

I would like to add ‹pay my› as a second alternative (and probably more relevant intent).
The first alternative ‬‚pay‬ seems more appropriate in this case. ‭pay me back‭  is not likely. But ‏pay for‏ is possible, though ‑my„ is probably closer to the intended meaning. It's an interesting situation: the question was not so much about what is something, as about where/from what came something? And I would say ․‡pay back ‡ comes into the picture as well, for the same reason: ‍‛What is that ‪“? what‪ is  coming from that place?!‫‟.‌
It's probably not very precise, or complete, and I do think that a simple, more explicit alternative would be the right way to handle it. (․It‖/‥It comes/comes from there‹, /It is from /it comes /is of /from /comes /came from. /It was taken from //It came from the library )"

I believe that add is an action verb and not an adjective in the sentence.
A verb is used to describe what somebody is doing. ""She is a good cook."" ""We are looking for a house.""
In the sentences you've written, you should use ""add"" as a verb. I believe it is correct. However, when speaking, people use the word as an adjectival. It's correct, I know, it's just the order is changed and that's the way it sounds when spoken normally. The second sentence and the fourth sentence are the exact same so I don't know why anyone would want to use something to increase the balance for anything. In your examples, the amount is already the same as it was when they were added. If anything, they would need to be subtracting something from another amount, and even if they do that, there is no difference in adding and adding money as opposed to subtract and subtract money. All of the examples would be exactly the the first two sentences. Why use more words than they needed for the explanation? I'm not really sure. Hope this helps! You are probably correct in saying something is acting like an adverb. Thanks for explaining and taking the time to comment back about it. :)
(I'm using a grammar checker and it didn't seem to like the use of ""are as"" and ""is"" but I can't find another way to say it without changing the meaning of my sentences.)
Edit: After looking into it more, your first sentence actually means you're increasing the money that you have in your account (in other words, adding chequable money to your chequerable account.). However that is not what the question is asking. He's trying to understand the grammar and how to make his sentences correct for when he's speaking to a listener.

You are right that if ""I want a bottle of wine"" does not occur in context where ""i want"" is, then we cannot interpret it.
There are many ways you could phrase the original utterances to make them more likely to occur with ""have"":
""I would like to top-up this card with $100. Could I please get a Cheque?""
or
 ""Can I have a $200 chequ? I'll give you the card for it.""

A:
I would assume that the phrase top you up with is a general phrase for topping something up by an amount less than the original amount, so it should be possible.

In other words, should ‘top up’ be understood as an act or a task or something else? I have a feeling that most English speakers would say “top-of-the-money” rather than ”top in cash“. It‘s just a matter of intuition, I guess, but I‒d love to know what other native speakers think.
I know this might be a strange question, given how common this question is („top the bill‬), but in general, how would one top? If you could „do‰top‛ something, what would you do? Is it possible to ‚do top‚ a thing? Are you able to do something †with top, and how? What would this ‡mean‹to say/say?‖ (cf. ″Top of the morning‴)
What would be an example of ‹a thing top of something›? 
This example comes straight from a news story and I was just wondering if there is a meaning for the ‛top of cash' ?

What are the implications on the system in terms of user intent or output? In fact, the goal of this activity is to develop your own intuition regarding a particular system design.
For the rest of my answer, let's say that a possible location can be ""a physical location or an online location"". (If you don't feel like using the exact term, then you can use something better suited such as ""location"" or ""point of sale"" to express the same thing.)
Now, given the set of location types, you need to determine a location for each intent. 
The first step in this is that you should think about how many of these you want to support. I am going to guess there is only one and therefore this should be your only location type. Now it is important to note that for this intent to work, your system should never ask the client to pick from a given location. It should just tell them ""Sorry, i can't find a physical cashier at this location."". You don’t need your user to have to think ""i want cash at the store down the street"" in order to use your intent ""top cash?"".
To do this, just have a single intent in your location intent and the first token will determine which location to choose from. To do that, simply use location = token1 for your top intents or similar."

What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","top-up account or topup-account? The top level of the hierarchy would thus be 'where is (the money) to be transferred?'. The first answer would be the right one and the one given in the corpus: the top of this hierarchy is 'from where to where' and it is a verb. The second answer is correct, however, as the question is about toping up the account. If we were to give the second question, a 'yes' would also be correct. 
I would like to ask a second follow-on question: when you see the word 'top', and given that you are referring to money, would you also consider that to mean 'the uppermost level in a hierarchy' or 'a level on a ladder'?

A:
There are a couple of ways to see how this is different. Here is how we would think in English: We are asking the user: Where do we go to use our account, and this might be different from how they have been doing things.
We might say: ""We can go into the bank"" (or into an ATM), or we might go online, or use a card reader in our store or something. We don’t want the answer to include “I can use my debit card at the store” or ” I can transfer money from my checking account to my savings account at a later time“. This would mean we are looking for the most direct place to perform the action, we want to do it at this time, etc. In all of these cases there is one place: we know we can do the thing in this location. ""I don't want a debit at home"" is more than fine. I may want you to put the money in an envelope and mail it to me, that would work just fine for me. But it won't be what you want. You might want your own checking and savings accounts, which are different than our example of ""a checking/savings account""
When we need to specify the place (which is what we do with top), we use this structure: at, to, from, with (I am not saying that it has to have a space; we could make a sentence from it). ""Where do you go?"" is fine,"

2.) I'm at the bank. They handed me a chequer. I gave them 10$ in currency. Do they think I have 10 $ or that I can pay them the amount with 10$.
So i'm not sure if we should have to mention the money or the chequest? I would have thought we would say cheques, not chequers, but the sentence above is very ambiguous. 
Thanks.
PS. The sentence should really read: I paid with a check. But is it possible, or at least more idiomatic, to say that we paid money with money?
UPDATE: The following sentence (in the comments) is wrong: 'He gave me the £50 as he had money in his wallet'. We can't give money for money, we usually talk about giving money as a gift for a friend. That would be the correct wording of the example. Or we can say (but this is rather unusual) He gave the $50 (because he has the cash in that amount in hand.)
I can give him £1 for example, because there's a bank account in the UK, and I want to pay the sum into it. There's the problem. In this case we need to tell the reader that i am a UK citizen. So it might be better to have I payed the guy 50$ and he gave it back to me, than 'I gave 10 dollars to him'.
The example should be: He give me 50 pounds, which he got it from a wallet with cash. Now, should it be money from wallet or money of cash?   Thanks. (and thanks to  @jakecarpenter for his comments).
PPS:  I think that the original question is actually very clear, so it can be read (I hope...) as an example of a sentence where the ambiguity has come up very frequently. If the person had not mentioned the exact name of that cheche, then the question would not be clear. For example:
Me: How much have you got in your wallet?  Him: £100
We would then assume that he is giving me that whole £ 100, but he could also be giving it to another person. It's only after the other person has left that it is clear that its not"

I know that, according to the bank, you must pay for an item you have in hand with cash and not with some form of credit card or a debit card. How do you make this determination? You can buy a book. It has been made a cash transaction only, since the book has never been available on-line. The book was printed. You have the right to buy it.

You should also pay cash, at a store, for other things which are, to you, not negotiable. These items are not for sale through the computer and have not been printed out. If you buy them, with your credit/debit card, it means that you are giving your promise that it is your money that goes to pay them. They can be taken away with the card and used by you or given to someone else to spend. This is a promise. To pay by check is to make an equivalent promise, and this is just as good as paying cash. In general, the credit system means a loss of power to do your will. With cash you can do exactly as your mind sees fit, while paying by credit or on a bank debit is more like a hostage situation. Cash is always better.




If i were a betting man, i'd put the answer to this question at 100 percent that all the cash is spent and nothing left over, no matter what other forms of payment are used, be they credit, check, or check with credit. But I'm sure the ""experts"" have already thought about this. Why? Because the question has a negative answer, that is, cash doesn't work, whatever that means!
I think this whole situation is absurd. We have a system of money which allows anyone to issue ""money"" (or credit) and to charge the holder of that money to others, without regard to need or demand, in order to enrich the person who issued the money. And if they don’t give you your share, they take a piece of your body, your property, a debt. That is why this entire system is corrupt and has to go.

There is no ambiguity in saying the word 'top', which would make it easy to determine a suitable intent from this example.
However, a sentence like can you send us a gift card? can I think of at least three possible 'intent' answers:

send me (the speaker) a card
  send (something or someone) us (a listener)
a card to send to us
card(s) to be sent to me
I want a (gift) card  
A card(g) is (what) I want
Give me a good card, I'll give you a better one back
Send us the card and I will send you the other one.  (I'll do this in the second example because 'I will' is a verb in that particular sentence, but in other examples I would use 'will' to specify an intent rather than a simple'statement')
The card's for me and you
Can I have the _________ card please?  I am going to give it to you. -(The speaker is going give someone else a present, so the example above says'send' as an answer)  [Note: the 'blank' should indicate what is being sent]
(I) will get you, or (you will) get me, the present that I promised you...  - (The example sentence is written like this to emphasize the answer of 'get me' or 'you' and is therefore using a question form of can, i.e. 'can you get?' or in this case just '?'.
What is this card for? [this card was the speaker's answer to the question 'why do we want this]  Is this for a boy? or a girl? - The person asking the questions has a specific idea as to what type of present they are looking for, and so has no need to know the gender of the object, because it will still work for both."

A natural first answer is that top up is an action, and so the second version would be a more appropriate form for the action of toping (or topping). This is a pretty reasonable answer, but I have a strong suspicion that the answer depends on the environment. The following are a couple of examples:
– In a call-center setting the first one would probably be the most appropriate.
The second answer would suggest that it is not a very well-formed natural utterances, since “a cash-top” does not make sense. Maybe it might be correct, or maybe it would not. But that’s what I‘d guess. 
What other answers might there be, that would make more sense than the above answer?
To be more concrete: I want you to answer the question (as above: ” i  ‘ want  do   a  top–up) in the form of a statement or a list of statements. It should not be assumed that only natural speech is to be used in this question. Any input in a different format is equally valid, so long as the input is unambiguous.

(For those familiar with the language, the context is: someone calls me with a question about using a website to perform an online bank transaction. He asks me for a description and then says the word „do.“ I could answer ‚ i have to top you up‛ as a first guess, which is what the natural answer implies. This answer might work in context, in which case the intent would likely be something like ‰ I would like to use your bank account‬, because of the implied ″ I know that your account is empty, i need/want to fill it with money″; the actual action is unknown at this point.

What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","I understand that ""card"" can serve as a noun, which in this context is not a problem. But I don't think it's necessary in the sense that a car is a kind of vehicle. 
I've read it this way: If the sentence is grammatically valid, then the most fitting intents for it (with respect to its verb forms) is: A physical object (need) a card, and it serves as both a subject and an object complement. Another way to think of this is that the physical need is serving as an adverbial object and that it is describing the card as being physical. And finally the verb is also serving in its object role, in describing something as physical, that is, it can also serve in that role.
Is this approach at least partially correct? It seems like an odd way of thinking about the concept, but in my research the examples have always been the way I stated it. Or is is simply not the case that we must think about these things this particular way?

A:
... it must be a logical argument, not something that has to be thought of in terms of an ""is-that-a-problem"" way. If it were logically valid to say ""i'd like two copies of the same card"", it shouldn't be considered to not make any sense. This is like saying ""I need two cars"", but you could easily say that you'd need ""a card"" of ""two cars"" if you mean one ""of"" the other. In the second scenario, the ""car"" is being used as the subject in an instance of a copula (the verb) to express a concept (like ""the same one""), in a way that can be interpreted as ""being"". That's perfectly valid and natural. I think your example is trying to do the exact same thing. It's just that I'm not sure about whether it would be seen as natural in all contexts."

[This is not a technical answer, but a response to your question: you should be aware of your intent as you formulate answers. Your ""What is a fee?"" question indicates a concern to know what the ""what are"" or ""why are"", and you want to understand the why behind the what. But your questions also reveal that you don't understand some of the terminology and are looking for confirmation of some things you have read in a blog post. So in addition to answering your ""fee"" question, I'm also going to add some additional clarifications of what it means to have an ""intended"" action, what ""means"" the intent behind it, or the context of a request. If you get these things, then hopefully you'll be able to make good decisions about how much to spend when getting or buying a card! :-)]
First, a disclaimer: I am a developer, with a focus on payments. I work in the merchant payment area, so I have a particular interest in understanding the payment side of things. 
As you know, there are two types of cards (in the U.S.): credit card and debit card. Credit cards are used for buying, and usually require a minimum monthly fee (sometimes a setup fee as well). Debit cards, on the other hand, can only be used to take out money. You have no choice with regards to paying your credit or debit cards - it either works or it doesn't.
So if we have the statements for an account that has both a credit and a debit, it will look something like this (for example):
+--------+-----------+
| Account | Card Fee |
==============================
   1 ___________  $10.99
*  +1 _______  *
 | $50.98
 *  |  -$5.01
 +____________
 $41.97
(I'm just showing the debit as debit; it looks like the same thing for credit, only with the plus sign instead of star.)
What I want you to notice is that the credit statement has a ""card fee"" and the bank statement does not. There are several reasons a bank charges a monthly ""statement fee"". But for our purposes we will assume that there is an actual charge of"

A:
*Why* the card is denied
In this case, why means why are you denying my request; there is no such entity as 'your' virtual money.
The virtual Money that the client owns, as an entity (a 'thing' called virtualMoney), is owned by the bank account it is stored in; it has no existence outside of the virtual world. 
If a user requests money from their own bank, there would be no issue because the money is theirs. However, this bank owns virtualBankAccountNumber123456 which is 'in use' by a client. The client can make a request with that virtual account number. It is up to the service provider to decide if they wish to allow that account; they are free to deny access if it becomes a concern that funds are going to be stolen or lost to fraud. If the account is locked, then any attempts to make requests against that number would fail, and this service would know that there was a problem. They do not want it to work, but their business requires that they allow their client to use it, even while the owner is offline. So the business chooses to provide access. This is a business decision, you do NOT have a right as a citizen to access virtual bank acount numbers; you may use that for your own purposes or you can go get another bank if you think that your bank is acting unfairly."

As such, for the sake of discussion, ""broke"" is what I am most interested in. If there's a single word for ""virtual thing broken(ed)"" I can use that in place of 'virtual'.

In this case, you've already used your card once, and you'd like your statement cancelled in case you don't need it anymore. I've seen that done online, as well as over the phone, but in the end it is very easy to do and there are no fees incurred.
If your use is for the gym, the only option is to cancel the subscription. That's pretty much the same as using your debit card to withdraw cash from the machine and then cancelling the cash. In the case of the virtual Visa debit you need the cancellation to take place before the transaction is completed, not after. If you were to use that card again, it would charge the second time. For that reason, Visa, Mastercard and the Bank of England would all agree that you cannot cancel a virtual charge on your credit card and that it's therefore ""real"". It may sound stupid, or it may make perfect sense to you, I'm not going to try to convince you one way or the other as I think it makes more sense for me to let you draw your conclusions. All I will do is point out the fact that the card issuer does in fact get notified, even if it can't do anything with it.

– @dasblinkenlight’s comment above –
The utterances you have chosen in your question will be evaluated against the same intent and trigger and therefore produce the exact same response, however, since the two uttering intents and triggers in the example are both about ‘are there‘, I would say that the intent will determine if the action of the “working card“ will actually be triggered. For example, an intent saying ” I think I” may indicate the presence of something in some place. So the response of „yes‟ or ‚no„ may be chosen with a given intent.
Intent can be described as the goal of a utter/utterance. It may include a description, a name of an object or situation, or a situation. The action that is triggered depends on the actual intention, that can either be given or implicit. Implicit intent does usually not make a sentence more specific, but it may influence the choices of which utter(s) are used to express the idea behind the sentence."

But how is this any different from the web page case? Is this just for eu and US markets and not for the US-EU markets? This is very vague. It doesn't matter what kind of card it is, it doesn’t matter if it's a VISA or MASTERCARD or AMEX, or a CHIP or whatever. We're not concerned with payment methods right now, and we just want to know what‘s wrong with my intent. And why it wasn„t matched. I just tried with a few examples of words from different fields, like:
i was shopping in a store and i had to pay for some items with cash. My virtual virtual wallet is not working, what should i do? i bought something virtual. i went to buy groceries with virtual cash virtual money virtual credits virtual currency virtual account virtual
All of them were matched except the last one. Is it because virtual only has one intent and virtual has two? In my previous example, virtual and physical are the exact same, but the first one is matched but not this one, how does it make sense? What‚s the difference? Are the examples above, just a coincidence or is it not matching for any virtual intent as well? Because I really don“t see any difference among different kinds of virtual items, whether it”s cash, cashback, credits, debit, mastercard, etc. The thing that‰s different among all of those, is what you are buying (products, services, subscriptions). So I don't think this difference in this respect, between physical and digital items has anything to"
929,my disposable virtual card will not work,"['virtual card', 'work card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","A:

What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","The following are the entities, events, and variables used in the ontology. We also list their URIs.
In this example, we consider an application that is a card-based application. A card is used to make online payments, in particular to transfer money, or make purchases at online sites like Amazon. Cards can either be physical, such as credit card, bank-debit card or prepaid card (like gift card), or virtual, that can be emulated and represented, by using a digital token. The use of a virtual debit or credit credit cards is widespread. An example is provided below:
An application of this type can make an online transaction. In the example below, the user is asking to pay her Amazon order. Let's assume the application uses a token, a representation of credit or debit cards. This representation is not necessarily a physical card. It could be the result of the computation of an encryption of some secret, which can then be stored in a database or a file. At runtime, this representation can serve as the basis for a set of online actions, like making a purchase, making an transfer, etc...
Here, an entity is called a User and two classes (in bold) are called Card and Payment. They are used as an example to illustrate how an ontological model is created. Each of them has attributes and relationships. These are represented as instances of classes, as shown in parenthesis. For example
Entity User
hasName (string name)
...
Card hasName(string cardName) {cardName}
Transaction hasAmount(float amount){amount} // amount is an attribute of transaction in ontologies
Payment hasMoney(decimal amount) [amount]
A Payment represents money. Card represents a debit (credit) card and it should be possible to ask it about its number and its name. Transaction is something that makes a payment. You should then have the possibility of asking it the amount it has. Note that amount and the attribute payment, are both attributes of payment as well. So the entity Payment can represent either money or some kind of debit card that has been used for making online purchases. There are other entities like a merchant, credit and debit networks, banks, financial companies, online payment service providers... Each could also be an instance of"

It is as if you had a stack of cards, and the virtual ones are on top. So to use one of these disposable cards: ""The first of those virtual will replace this one, which is on the second position of the list"".
3. Using it will remove the top card from the stack (if any) and replace it with the one on its right in your stack. If the user chooses the next card then it gets replaced with your current (first one you can see).

In order for the model to work, it has to know the context in which it is operating. I'd recommend to model this context by using an Intent Classifier or a context detector.
The intent classifier should be aware of the fact that an utterable ""my disposable my"" can't be the only possible intent. You could add a second intent for that, which would be my (in the sense of ""to make my"", and the card in question has a slot for a card.

The intent rejected can't be ruled out at all: for example, it might have been used as the subject of the conversation. The only thing that is clear here is ""I am confused"".
A couple of other considerations: (1) the more the payment method is unusual, the greater the likelihood of confusion between the two. This is true regardless of whether they're both used in the same scenario. (2) Reject means something quite different with a virtual versus a physical card: a card that has been rejected and put it back into the system. A virtual one can be rejected or revoked any time, and it has no physical location to do that."

In a nutshell, a Disposable Virtual Card is like virtual money. It has a number, but can still be sent anywhere. How can this be achieved? For the most part, it is not possible.

The most common thing that„Virtual Currency“ has become a buzzword over the past few years. We‚ve all heard of Bitcoins, Litecoins, Dogecoins etc… and have a fair amount of understanding on how these virtual wallets (and currencies) work. I think it‒s time to take a look at what a simple account really is, and how it functions. An Account is simply a „number‟, like a bank account number. But this could be anything… you could have an account for your business, for an investment, whatever‥. All the ‚Account‹ functions work with any kind of account, regardless of it being Virtual or Physical. Accounts are not limited to ’virtual‛ things, in some ways they are even more powerful when they become Physical! You can have Physical Accounts, Accounts in your phone, on a website, or in whatever is accessible for you. And all these accounts can interact with each other! In this article, i‗ll be showing you how you interact between 2 accounts through the use of a Wallet‖. Before we move on, here is an explanation on some basics that we will need to know.

I suspect that your virtual-card-rejected-subscription-intent is wrong. For your situation, it sounds like you're trying to say: you tried (successfully, so far) to redeem a physical card to spend money to buy a virtual gym. The physical gym card was rejected in that instance because the card you presented was invalid or did not have enough money on it. You tried to make something of a different kind, which is not appropriate for this situation.
You have to use an intent that expresses the meaning of virtual vs physical. There isn't any intent ""subscriptions"" so it's the ""reject this virtual [card for X] for no particular reason"" intent. In some situations you might be able to add some context. If your gym's name was ""Virtual Gym"" you could add the intent: gym-virtual-gym

What is wrong with that sentence??. I thought ""outrageous charges"" and ""holiday shopping"" were good, while the ""known charges""-one would expect ""unknown"" but, well, it's wrong. In fact, the last one would fit better, in my opinion. Why is ""atm"" there? It is like ""machine"", in a way, because we don't usually use ""used charges"", but at a cost, which is not the case with the other two words that I can think of. What's so special about ""use""?
The most probable hypothesis I have is: the use of this particular atem implies a machine that charges with a known cost that you have already paid. It's also used as a comparison. So, ""I used an atement to pay the costs of holiday shoppiing"" would mean, I used it to compare how many charges I paid as compared to how much of a holiday it took to do it.

In the case of: 'Rate the exchange is incorrect', 
I would suggest the correct answer is: rate (in the context of the sentence)
It would make no sense for you to be able to 'exchange the rate of exchange', since to do the conversion you first need to understand the 'rate of rate' (if you will).  This is why the first option is 'incorrect'; to convert to the second option you need some prior understanding of why you want to know 'the rate'.
On the other hand, this makes little sense:
'The exchange of a rate has an incorrect rate.'
The reason is that you could be referring to something else entirely, for example: you say: ""the exchange has no rate""

960,can i get a description of how to use a disposable virtual card,"['use card', 'virtual card', 'use card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","What are the differences, and is one of them better?

For example, a person might say: I want to buy a gift card from Visa.
Would the intent be a: purchase or a use virtual gift Card? 
Should the response be: The best fit is use Virtual Card.  What would be the difference between use and purchase? If the use intent is correct, what is a purchase intent? Is that a correct response? I'm confused about how a virtual Card would work, since, when you use the Visa card, the physical card is used. How can a Virtual card work if the user is purchasing a physical item and using a Visa Card on line (not using the actual physical Visa) card on their account? This is just confusing to me. Also how does this help to identify the real intent of a question? Should a conversation between a bot and a human be able to answer this question and help a user identify their intent. Is there an example of this? Or is this something a chatbot must know before being able answer such questions? Thanks. -Brian
*Note: This question was answered and posted by @james-d-wade in the comment section of the post:
The use statement in this case represents a transaction with a card that is linked to your online account using Virtual/Digital cards. A purchase (or purchase) statement represents the action to purchase a real world (physical) gift voucher. The difference is that you have to physically go to an authorised VISA/MasterCard outlet in order to complete a VIRTUAL purchase, whereas a USER purchase can be made from online retailers. In some countries, Virtual purchases do not require the V card to be swiped, as it is assumed the payment has been authorised by the consumer, so in other ways, V transactions and P transactions (in some contexts) are similar
Thanks @Brian! @JamesD.Wade

JohnAug 5 '12 at 21:59
it's a really strange sort of question. it sounds like what you're asking is 'what sort card should I buy?'. I can't decide on the merits of 'work card', 'VR card' or 'card that just fits'.
But I'll give you the answer anyway
You should definitely get the 'Work' card if you want the most work/play cards and the highest value/money. The 'Virtual Reality' is probably your best bet if VR is your thing. There is no 'just fitting' here, because all VR cards are of a similar value. If you were to play any of them, they'd work perfectly. That said, you'd have the same problems with any VR card that isn't VR specific. It's also worth noting that 'Works for everything' cards have less work than VR, and VR has less value than 'works for everyone'. However, 'virtual reality' can mean a lot of different games to a different person, so even the VR games would probably not be enough to give a definitive answer to your question 'What sort VR game should i buy?'
So if we ignore the value vs work question, what card do you use for gaming, as in which game does it work best for? Well you've covered the basics: VR and Work cards. However if it is VR you really want then there is just the question of what games do work well with VR. Well for VR 'everything' may work, depending on how 'good' your headset is. Personally I use the Rift, which is great, works everywhere and plays everything. You'd probably want a VR version of Skyrim, Portal or The Room, although the Vive has its own game portfolio. In any case though, that's not the issue. 'Everything' VR will probably work because 'all' games are the games you play at home/on your phone anyway.

Here is some more context:
I want an API token to provide access to some restricted data. The API can either grant permission to the token (i.t. by sending an OTP) or provide a token for the API (and I would have to revoke access if the person has access).
A card is used as the OTC, that I can give them and that they can use to make transactions without revealing their identity (or without having to reveal their real identity - this is optional). The card can also be used for making payments in certain locations or when using certain payment methods. To my understanding, a ""virtual card"" means a type of card that can only be made visible to a specific individual (it's a kind of secret, in short). But the question was how to phrase that. I had in mind something like:  “i’d like temporary access”; ”i'd be thankful for a [a virtual] card“;  and other options were suggested. This is how I asked.

The answer to this question will depend on how your model is built.
If you have the question: Do disposable cars have air conditioning? then the answer is ""yes, they do"" even though I know that the person asking may have some mental model which is more restrictive than a simple ""air conditioning"".
Your model probably should be a little bit more complex, but your specific sentence is ambiguous enough that your only choice really is to make some assumptions about how people think.  If we make the same assumption that we are all ""simple models"" and we all think in simple declarative sentences, we can get a result like this:  
""Disposable card"" has the closest match of ""explanation"" to the example sentence that I can find. ""Explain"" is closest if you think of the card being an explanation of something that already exists. The ""cards that explains"" option is best if the ""card"" means the information on the cards. You will want to check your own mental models for the right fit and make modifications accordingly."

A work item can be one of the physical items of a card; a physical card, on the other hand, could be used to hold physical works (e.g. a work of art). We are also likely using the card for some non-artistic uses - for example, in the game of poker. The second usage, for a poker example card game, would be to use a 'virtual' card that holds other information (such as a ranking of who is 'best'), which could then be exchanged among players.
As for whether the 'card' could work, well, there is a bit of ambiguity. It might be clear that a paper card could (and perhaps even should) be virtual, while a more traditional card would not. On the more physical side there isn't much to go on."

I would say that the ""obtaining"" cardless card is a specific intent and ""what is... best... fitting"" intent is vague. You're probably looking for the second.
However, given the ambiguity and vagueness of your question I will go with a different answer and say, don't worry too much about it, you're not missing out on anything special with this type of carding. If someone is really interested in what you say ""best fitting"", they may want you to explain why. But as a general rule, just get them a newbie card in a hurry and they'll be satisfied for a while. Or get someone else to get it for them. :-)
Also, do you have a good understanding of how the internet works? I'll assume not because you asked this question, and that's why I'm going to suggest that you find a guide or tutorial on making virtual cards that don'r require a physical card and then you can make your own. There's nothing wrong with your idea of a virtual ID card you just haven't taken the time to learn the ins and outs of making them (at least, not yet). If you want help doing that, then I'd suggest the tutorials on make.com that I suggested in another answer. The one I mentioned is here:
http://tuts4all.make.cool/tutorial/making-and-using-a-virtual-card/
In addition, I would suggest you learn how to make a website. This is an important skill if you plan on having a business in the future. And that is, of course, assuming you are interested not only in making the virtual credit cards but also having your website so that people can pay you. So if that IS your ultimate goal, make sure you get started doing the first part because it is important. Good luck!

You also asked in comment: ""How do I get one of these cards?""

I’ve been working on this question for a while, and am finally done.
Here are my findings, in no particular order. There are more questions. And they are not all easy, nor have I come up with all the answers. This post is long, so make sure you have some time. Or don‘t, that”s fine too. Read it, make up your own mind. I hope I“ve presented a good, well thought out, argument. My intention is to convince you that we need new ways of thinking about virtual currencies. Let‚Äôs find out.


The best definition of a virtual good is: A virtual commodity which is not tied to any tangible good. An example would be the virtual cash of an MTO. It‍‹ËØs a commodity that is exchangeable for other commodities. For the purpose of this discussion, we can simplify: it Å¯s anything that can be exchanged for another good in exchange for something else. If that commodity has utility to the holder, it has value to them. We can call anything a ‚„ virtual‛‰ thing which doesn‌›ÊÙt have a physical counterpart of any sort. Examples are virtual land, virtual real estate, the digital assets of companies and so on. These are all examples of virtual commodities or currencies, where the physical equivalent is just another digital commodity. So the first definition we have to deal with is „virtual thing that has a tangible counterpart‟. Here are the things I can think of:

 A thing, which has no concrete counterpart.‭‬‮ ‫‫
Example: “a digital good‖. In a pure digital world, there could be something similar to a digital Good. ‏‪    But this one has to be a real digital thing in the real world.

985,when can i order a disposable virtual card?,"['order card', 'virtual card', 'order card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","I have read some research papers on the subject, but they mostly address intent identification for the virtual order.

What are some of the things that a person might want to achieve with a virtual (disposable) card for a mobile device?
Some examples might be as follows:
A person would want a card that allows them to do the same thing with an app or website, as they would if they were ordering a physical business card or a paper card. Perhaps, in this case, they could want something more than the bare basics: something with their contact details on it, possibly with some imagery, etc..
However, there might not be a ""good"" way to express intent in a way that the person wouldn't recognize as a duplicate. For example they might have some business cards somewhere, and they think they should order more. They could have a list online, that they want more cards printed from, or just a wish list they can order from. However, the wishlist might just be something that can be easily implemented in software. This is where the ""dis-dis"" comes in. The person could use it to get a discount, for example, by using some kind of coupon code they get on a social media platform. (Or not, depending on what the company's policy is on this, of course.) They don't even want the physical card, so it can't be an actual card!
In either case: if the intent is for them, then the card is a perfect fit; if it's for someone else, it might still be useful. How can the phone know what it is meant for? This depends on how the system deals with this. It's probably not a problem if, say a user who gets this card on their business contact's smartphone is able to just print it out themselves, to then use as another business ""card"".
I'm trying to find examples of this sort of system, with real implementations. If anyone has a good reference, please point me to it. I don' know how difficult it would be to build it with, perhaps, some type of a QR code?

And maybe, is it possible that asking ""how many"" is a more correct question than ""can I"" when it comes to intent determination? What does this mean?

To clarify...I am a newbie...just started toying around with LUIS on a few random web pages to see how it works and to just understand the ""why"" of things. To me it seems the most important aspect to understand about LU programming is intent...so I figure the next logical step in my learning path is ask about that. I know how to ask questions about things, and I feel comfortable with that aspect, however, I am struggling with knowing when a sentence is best answered by ""YES/NO"", ""many"" or ""one"".  So, thanks so much for you patience. It really helps!  Also wanted to clarify in case the answers"

I would guess that you'd want a card that says the same thing and that it can be discarded if necessary. For instance, I could have a single card (that I might write on) that I show at a business meeting that indicates to the recipient what sort of business card I'm offering as well as what my title is. It would be the business equivalent of a disposable e-card."

What we could have here?
a) a person who ordered a virtual Card in his computer but now wants to order a physical card for the same. In which cases a simple virtual order would be the most fitting. It wouldn't hurt if the physical one is cheaper and the customer gets a better discount
b) A person that wants a card in physical, but the virtual one can't be found in the website at the moment. This case may be resolved by giving him a special offer for physical cards if he wants
c) There is a website that sends physical orders by mail. So in that case, the intent is clearly to send physical items. The virtual cards are already there, and he has no need for a specific physical Card. Therefore, this is very unlikely to be a goal of his."

The charge of “extra” currency is a bit of a red herring here, as the charge is in the context.

If you‟re referring to the cost of making a currency transfer, I“d suggest using „. I charge money for currency transfers in. That being said, it doesn„t really make sense to use any of the examples that you mentioned because the verb in question (›exchange‽) takes singular. You can‹t ‹exchang‚ currency. However, you can ‚charge‛ for a ‛charge for exchange ’ (though it sounds more like you are charging a fee for this service).
There is nothing wrong with using 'extra' when it's referring specifically to an additional thing on top of another thing, but if you're talking about a cost for the exchange of currencies, there will always be a'standard' cost, and the extra amount is referring simply to money in addition to whatever it is to pay."

1000,is there a fee for using a european bank card to top up?,"['using card', 'bank card', 'european card', 'top card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","A:
This question, as phrased, requires an English-language understanding of the meaning of 'used a', the word 'card' and the noun 'bank card' - but in reality all three of these are used in the context where one is talking about a bank account.
So it's not really a ""Which intent does 'is there' express?"" question. You are not describing a situation where a specific person or thing can be identified unambiguously; rather, you are describing an activity where two events, which occur at roughly the same time, can both be described as 'using', but which one takes place prior to each of those two things (i.e. 'usage' of that 'credit' card; and'making the charge' to the card).
If you were to put your question in a context involving someone's checking account in general, then'make the check' could potentially be the one which refers to a check being made, using the money in that account; but the way I'm reading your phrasing, the question is about an account which is specifically identified by a card rather than a 'checking' account as a whole."

A:
As far as I know, I don't think it is possible to add money to an ""international card"". ""International cards"" are a kind of ""foreign card"", usually issued by a bank or credit card company. I would therefore expect that ""add money"" is more appropriate for ""adding money"".
""International card"" would more likely mean a card with your name on it, so you could ""have"" an International card, but not ""make money of/to""."

First thing, you are probably looking at this from an NLP perspective, and that’s probably the wrong way to approach this. The best approach I have found to be taking a conversational approach:
1. Start by asking, in general, what someone did
2. Once you figure out what they did, then you try to understand the why“
Then when you have figured out why, ask questions along the lines of: ‘why did you choose to do that?‘

My intuition says that the correct answer is ""no"", in both cases, but I would like to have your help in clarifying my doubts.   I've tried to think of different ways to rephrase the sentence, without changing the meaning, and here's my tentative list of candidate intents (all of them correct in their own way): 

  to do something for free us to charge for doing it
  do the opposite of topping

Thanks in advance.
PS.: I am aware, as a fact, that in Spanish there is no direct relation between a verb and its object, the verb is always an indirect object. That's a good example of what I'm trying to avoid in all the different intensions. As a matter of fact I have no idea of how to express directly the same thought in English. Maybe you guys could help me with the English version of it, by proposing different re-phrasing/translating of the Spanish sentence. :)
I am not native speaker of English, therefore any help is appreciated. I'd like also to add, before closing this question, some clarificatory comments:
(1) I know this sentence is ambiguous (see the comments below), but it would suffice to use the term ""the opposite"" without any reference to the subject and/or context. Indeed the fact is that I was asked for a translation that would correspond, for example, to a native English speaker. The reason why ""top the cards up"" makes me feel uncomfortable here is because I feel that, when the object is a plural verb, there should be a clear reference of ""for the benefit of"" the subjects, something like ""us and them"". So, I find more appropriate to translate ""do the reverse of that"".
Another problem I encountered was that some of my friends think the charge-for-the-us-cards-toping is wrong. They insist that we should translate the entire expression as ""pay the card topping"", without ""charge for"". But the original is not wrong! The charge, which should include the money we will pay (and it does!), is for the act of adding the topping to our credit card. It's not like we pay"
1006,are there fees for top ups?,"['top ups', ' ups']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","A:
There are no fees charged for topping up a prepaid phone card for which you've got a recharge code. The only time you'll pay a fee is if you use the ""top up now"" feature on the website or if your phone service provider (or your mobile phone provider, etc.) charges you to top up from your own mobile plan.
I'm a little confused by your question, though. If you mean: ""Are there any fees associated with charging an additional number of credit/recharge/top-ups to an existing (prepaid) phone number?""
Then I can only say that, as far as I'm aware, there are none."
1007,what are the charges for us cards with top up,"['us cards', ' top']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","A:

C: What do they charge for a card top-up?

E: They charge you for our card to top  up  
I don't understand your question, what ""best"" means? Which is your intention? The one-or-all answer for D,C,E may be the one that gives you the most information."
1008,is there an additional charge for topping up using a european card?,"['using card', 'european card', 'using card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","A:
– is this charge applicable?, or
- do i need to pay this? (this should be a separate question, depending on whether you should do this, and whether it is free)

1) The first option seems to suggest that charges are a kind of fee, the second doesn't. In what way does the first sentence help to convey the sense in which charges might be taken? In general, can anyone recommend a guide (a book, online article, anything) on how to choose between a range of alternatives when you don't quite know the right answer? Is there a set procedure for deciding what is best? If you could give me a pointer on where to begin, that would be fantastic.

Note that, with all the answers so far, this question is about the use of the verb 'take', not about whether the answer 'yes' or 'no'. The only correct answer is 'No' to the question ""Would you say that you top up your car every month in the US?"".
I'm asking this, of course, because the OP might not see the difference between 'top ups' and 'charger fees'.
To the person asking why the 'taking fee' answer (which is not the correct one) is marked, I can only advise that it's the wrong verb to use. It's possible that the original poster thought they had said 'in exchange of a top off' which is why he or she asked for help. A better answer was provided. That is all I would like to add. :-)
(But I do think the marking of this particular answer as ""not helpful"" is a bit harsh)
EDIT: I have been informed by the SO team that this is an appropriate place for a question concerning the English language. I am not complaining; my only gripe is that I could not find this information myself. This is my first post on any Stack Exchange site, so I apologize in advance if I don;t understand how things work and what should and shouldn;'t be done, but I'm happy to learn. Thanks all for your help!

EDIT:  This question is being voted to close as ""too broad"".  It's being done, I believe, because a) the list of options is very long; and b) each of the options can have different semantic content that is not captured in the questions being asked.  The answers that make most sense (to me, at least) fall into two categories: (a) a simple, single-word ""answer"" (e.g., ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""charge, no""); (b) an ontological description of a ""natural kind"" or other concept whose semantics one can infer from the context. Neither of these answers is terribly useful on the site (although I would love to find some sort of site-wide rule or standard to decide on these types of questions).
I can understand the concern about the scope of such a questions, but I think it can do some good. I have seen similar questions asked on SE before - some even with multiple correct answers. If we could find a way to make them more useful, perhaps they can find their way into an FAQ somewhere, or at the very least they'll make a more natural topic for meta discussion. The FAQ is a place to define the rules of behavior here, and if the answer to any question here can reasonably be inferred from a FAQ post, then we should certainly include the answers in one, should we wish to do so. We should be able to use any answer here that seems reasonable, as long as it is consistent with the FAQ. (And that's all I want here - a consistent answer that makes sense). If there is no clear ""correct"" answer, we can certainly allow a list to be put out there, with a single vote on which list is most useful for the purposes of answering this question.

Thank you everyone who replied. This was a great community of knowledge. To me it seems a clear argument is that: There are infinite numbers of ways of toping up your card.

1016,what fee is included if i top up by card?,['top card'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","top amount? fee if so?

The top-level intent is a ""card-top-up"" intent. It would typically have a value of ""top"" and a top (or ""best"") match. We have created this intent so our system can automatically respond to the most likely ""what fee"" question by default.
You can set the top intent as a default for your bot if you prefer. You'll also see in the Bot Builder Studio, when you test your chat with the bot, we give you the option to enable the intent to ""Card Top-Up"". If you don't, then the system assumes you are asking ""What fee?""
I assume it's ""no fee""?. If the answer is yes (i.e. ""yes fee""), then that means you want to do something with that card (top up) in some particular way? If so, you'll get an event."

Unsure. In this case, the context is a card-topup.
If you say ""charge top"" that could be ""top up"" or the same thing with a difference in semantics. If you can clarify in the question, maybe we have a clearer answer. Thanks for posting. +12 for you
+1 for me
Edited to add: It's more likely that a topup isn't a charged transaction, just an increase in a balance. I don't think the two are necessarily mutually exclusive. A charged item is just one type of item that increases a user's credit limit. You can top that up with anything, as long as it is available. It may or may not be a charge. (See my comment below)

Add an answer: I think you're right that ""used"" is not a valid intent for this question. There should still be two intents. ""Use card"" would be the action of using the card. And ""credit card toped up charge"" (as the name of the intext suggests) would just mean charging the credit on it. So I'm going with that. For the original intent I'd go for something like ""I want to charge on my credit cards"".
Added a new answer, since I've changed my mind a bit about it:
To be honest though, even if it were ""charged"", that's ambiguous on whether it's a debit or credit because of how cards work in terms of charges. With the euro and the dollar, it makes some sense, in that you'd only make a purchase if there was money there. Then, once it comes out of your account it would only be debited if the top is ""more money"" because the bank can keep track of where all of it goes. But I imagine a lot of cards have"

If an AmEx or Master card is meant specifically. I might infer from that the answer is ""no extra charge, because the card itself is an American card.""
(It also looks like ""europeans bank"" is in fact a real country with a government, not just an expression used for the whole euro zone. So ""bank card"" would have to mean that card you use to access the country's bank, and that it's valid in that particular country)."

Is there a specific phrase that is required for this use of top- up. The phrase topup, does appear frequently in context sentences so I presume it should not be a problem.

A:

 pay + an object
  
 a payment made by the owner of an item, for another item or service, usually using a card or debit or credit card.

  use + a device
a device used for something."
1021,will i be charged for topping up by card?,['topping card'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","topping credit card by? topping credit? What about other alternatives, such as topping off, topping out, or topping over? Can a similar approach be used for other utterances?

For example:
Topping over my card or will I be hit with a penalty charge for having too much cash left in my account? Will i get charged to top up my prepaid by credit/debit card today, even if I just added an amount of say, 50p? 
What about the above example re-worded like:  I'm topping my credit and debit cards. I've got £40 left on credit, but that doesn't cover my spending.  Can I top off or up to £50 by debit card, with only 20 quid on my debit? Or will that be considered topping the card up, and so I'll be faced with the charge? Any ideas? Is the rephrasing of 'topping' the wrong verb? If it is, what should be reword as? Topping off? Top off?, topper, toppered, top over or topped? I don't know.

P.S I have read other Stack Exchange questions but they do not address my specific examples, so have not found a suitable response. If the question has been already asked and answered, I apologize in advance. My question is different from the ones I found so far as I want to specifically know whether or not the verb topping should have an s, like I mentioned above, whether it's the top or the topping.

1023,what do you charge for top ups?,"['top ups', 'charge ups']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","Top up charging chargeups? The following paragraphs aim to illustrate how to use an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Network to help with this problem.

LSTMs are neural networks that use a type of memory (short- and long-term memory) to solve a complex task. They are often described as “deep” or ‘learning’ neural network models (because they include multiple layers of neuron units).
An LSM is typically made up of three layers:
The Layers
First, there is a ’s‘, the memory unit (or cell), which is used to store a number of bits or bits in its input or output. These bits can be ”written“ into the cell and can then be stored for the next time unit that has been input into it. The L„ or s"" can hold a different input bit on each time it is called on to make a calculation. It is able to remember previous bits. This memory can also be called upon to recall previous information. L
In a way, it works just like a normal computer memory. If we look at this memory as being a computer‟s memory, we can store bits for a certain amount of time (a bit, in this case, being the number 1 or 0). These can either be a ""1"" or a bit for ""0"". Each „bit‡ can represent a value of something, which can in turn represent another value, e.g. ""I'm a boy"". This value can later be ""retrieved"" by the same computer, and it will return the ""bit"", ""boy"". For example, this value could be the name or number ""John"".
We then have the L2, or memory layer, on top of the s. There, each memory cell is made with a specific ""neuron"" unit. Each neuron has some weights, as well as a threshold. Weights are like the connections between neurons, while thresholds are the values that each neuron can activate, meaning the neuron will be activated or not. For more information on neurons and neural nets, please refer to our neural net glossary or the links below. When a particular neuron gets input of a 0, its output remains at 0; however, when it does not get the 0"
1024,will it cost anything to top up a us card?,"['top card', 'us card', 'top card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","The only reasonable thing to say in this instance is: top-up is a transitive verb. If the speaker is talking about top ups, he is using the term with the transitative or object marker + ing form:
top ups cost.
In this case, will and top are treated as intransitive verbs, without an object, like in will cost, which means they are used as verbs in their own rights: they have their regular meaning. The speaker does not need to use top, because they can use the verb to mean: the thing the person is doing when they top the card, for example: 'I top my us cards'.
If this is not what the questioner intends to know when asking about the cost of a topup, and they really want to ask about topping up, the sentence is asking a different question which has a completely different implication. 
This is because the noun us and the adjective card refer to two different subjects: one subject who has 'us' card and another subject for 'the thing' which is being topded up."

It sounds like you are saying that ""toping up"" your card is like a ""have"". In that case, as far as I can tell, the answer is no, ""tops up doesn't"" has the same meaning as ""has"" as in have or have, so it should be ""do"" or ""is"" rather than ""topping up"". 
(As a personal note, I dislike the verb topping. It is not particularly well defined in dictionaries. However, to top a card sounds odd. Topping a cake would be more common, but topping something like the roof of a house would not be)."
1026,are there fees for adding money using an international card,"['using card', 'international card', 'using card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","I would be most helpful to hear what native speakers say in response to this utterances, or any other, that have the same meaning as the above:
A. We do not charge fees when adding using a card from Canada.
B. Adding money from a Visa Card is free at our stores. If it is not free, the merchant will provide a sign. You may pay for the sign at the register. 
Which of the two should be regarded as more natural? If any of them is, what's the reason?  Which sounds more likely to a native speaker and why? Any information, explanations and/or references to native and professional English dictionaries will be greatly appreciate. Thank You. :)   :)
EDIT: I'd like to clarify the meaning of 'using an card' in both of these cases, to make the question simpler and clearer. I have already tried to edit it but I might have made it more complicated and it did not really help much. This is because the word is used in two different ways in my opinion. In the first one, 'adding' is referring to 'add money to the balance of a credit card'. In this sense, we don't need to worry about fees, and the fact that the card in question is an 'international' card will not affect the sentence in any way. For the second case,  'Using a Credit Card' can mean two things: 1) adding or withdrawing money with a (non-international) credit or debit card (this case I think that, unless you are withdrawing in Canada, you won't be charged for that; as for this one I'm not sure if there are any fees at all); 2) Using a debit or credit (not international) card to withdraw/add funds or to buy something (This one does not make any sense at least to me). If you think you can clarify any ambiguity in the context of using this example in either sense of this word, please do, I will greatly be appreciated. Thanks. :))  (I've updated the title in hopes that it will make it easier to find, but if not, any feedback is welcome).
Also, for 'card international', I would say that 'to add' with 'with a foreign' should not be used; it could be a bit misleading"

1) You have to pay something
2) Your topups get cheaper and you have an amount which is lower than your available balance

Top up the value $0.05. And then you could say

There's a few different possible things that could be going on here. I think the one is most probable is that the speaker doesn't have a firm grasp of English grammatical concepts, and so thinks they say: 'I need use use' when what they really mean is: ""I can use something that I have, such as 'use', which can be used to mean 'to use it as a card.

1029,is it okay to use a bank card to top up,"['use card', 'bank card', 'top card']","Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","I think that this may depend on whether card or card is understood in a strict or a loose sense, but I've not seen any discussion about what, exactly, is involved in the strict/loose distinction.

A:
– I use the card with the intent to withdraw money. I withdraw the money with card. – I buy the book with it. But this is very ambiguous if the person using the bankcard is a book store or an online shop or whatever. 
For the sentence:  I give my credit card number to a online bank. The speaker gives the number on the credit to the online banker. So they intend to receive money or to get a money-value for their card in another way. This is also very common in e-commerce. For example I gave my bank account number and password to another person so he could make transactions. He can send money from an account he knows on my card and he can get money on his account on to my account. A person may have two accounts because he needs some extra money (for example to go on vacation) and the other account is his personal account which he uses to save money for the future. In this situation, I would say that the speaker's meaning is to share his money, his creditcard with another bank customer. If he would use my money to buy for himself things like food, clothes, shoes,... I may consider this as ""spending money"".
So, the meaning of the second example sentence is different to me, depending on what the user of ""bank card"" intends to do with his card, and in which ""sense"" of that term he intends it to be."
1030,any fee for topping up?,['topping fee'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","topping_fee? nofee_for_topping_up?

I'm leaning towards no fee. It makes perfect sense as I'm only interested in the result, not how you get there.
However, the last example seems a bit odd. Should you ask ""I don't want any money, just to top it up?"".
The first example is probably the most correct, but I can't help but be a little confused when the other two examples are given. 
Is anyone able to explain these to me? Thanks!
P.S. I know about ""fee"" vs ""charge"" (I've used those terms to mean different things in contexts that seem identical in this case, such as ""price"" and ""what you pay to use a service""). However, I don;t think the ""use case"" here is about fees, it's just a general question about the word. If this is not possible, that answers it for me, and I'll move on. But if it is possible to say ""No fee, please"" to the question, then I'd like to know why this would be acceptable and the others, even though they seem equivalent to ""not charging anything at all?""   Thanks again. (:
Edit: I also see there is no ""topingfee"". I think that's because it should be ""Topping fee"" not ""Topin fee"". (Although the latter makes sense.)
(Edit2: The correct term is ""pricing"" or ""cost of service"".)
Update: So, as the responses below indicate, this question is a duplicate. However I want to leave it open, for people who might not know how or when it'd be used, to see if someone can come up with a better, more clear explanation of how these are used. Thanks. : )
Also, @Rory I am not sure where you got the idea that you could use the phrase to denote 'not a fee' but then also the term for a fixed amount. As I understand it, a topping charge is fixed and it can be changed. In contrast, 'no charge' would not be fixed, since changing it would require a new price to be set.

It's possible to calculate how much money you can lose or win if it's not the card you're holding.

Updated question
To clarify my question, there exists a slot called “amount”, and an intent that is called ""top-down"". I want to know which intent has the most common value in the context of ""I want  to buy  something with my top ups"", so that the testing of intent & slot will be more efficient.

Thanks,  I got some idea. However, some slot are not available, for instance, ""card"" is not defined as one of the slot for topup, while I expect this slot can be used for the topups.

There’s no perfect answer. Each of those options has a different meaning, and that meaning is determined in part by the context the question is asked in.

What are the top 3 verbiage options, given the intent of this utterances: Verify identity, verify person, Verify name

Intent
Verify Identity
If the user says Verify Identity, the system is asked to prove that the identity of the person is correct. For example, a user may verify the email address associated with their credit card account. The user can also verify their identity against any stored biometric data such as their fingerprint. This verification will typically allow the app to continue to operate in the context of that account, which might include accessing sensitive personal information such us financial data.
You can think of a verification identity function as a function that takes in credentials and outputs a token of some kind that can be presented to a 3rd party (ie: a credit company, or other app) in order to establish that an account is indeed authentic. It can take a long time to get this verification to the 3-rd Party. 
This is done so that users don't have to reenter sensitive information every time they use the App. If the credentials are valid the token will be valid for a while. But if they aren't the application might need some way to let the User verify they actually own the account before continuing operation. So the Token is only valid when the Credentials are correct and only for X seconds after being created. To be clear, this is an example of verifying Identity for the sake of an app. There is no such thing as an Identity Verification API per se. You'd call it something else if it were your use case. An example may include:
function verifyIdentity(creds: string, token: any): boolean {
  ... verify credentials
}
let hashed = crypto.createHash(...);
token = hash.digest(...)
verifyIdentity(token, id, hashe,...)
Where id would be some identifier for your application and token would a string representation of something the Identity has for verification. In the example we see that we are going to use some crypto to generate the hash and verify that digest against a value we've got in another location which represents the has the same digest as the one we got. A more complex example might be

A:
The first thing you need to do is to decide what you actually want to show.
If you just want others to believe that you are who you say you  are, you might want ""establish identity"".
However, ""prove identity"" suggests that what matters is who is right. I don't think you really mean that. It's also ""proof of identity"", but you can't really ""show identity of X to somebody"". It is an objective fact that X is Y, and you must accept X as Y. However, in a more practical sense, the identity might be established by showing that your documents are in order, or that the other person has already seen that person. 
In most situations, however, it is irrelevant what other people think. In fact, they might even make it worse. You can establish your identity simply by telling them what it means to you, how it has helped you in the past, what are the consequences if it doesn't work. Even then, people have different ways of handling things. So, unless there is something that needs to happen, there's no need for anyone to ""believe"" you."

I know a number of people use the term 'check' to mean 'look up the record and verify whether that record is a match of my query' (or similar) - i.e. check for existence. For this kind of usage the two intent: check existence need intent and check-existence need may be the most accurate (with both need and may being considered possible).
But I also know of other meanings of 'need' when it comes to check, for example the meaning 'I want to confirm this is true': need true and need false. And a few other usages that would require a look-up of the query to determine intent.
Is there any better way to handle this than just to have a list of intents, one for each possible usage? I mean, the answer for 'what are you getting?' would be to pick one of them - I could even define a default if there is no explicit intent - which is what I have been doing. But now I've been asked not only what am I getting but also what does it mean to need, want, need? So I was planning to give a definition for need - to try to clarify the definition - and then use intent to match the appropriate intent (check/need/etc). Is this a reasonable approach? It's fine if the intent is ambiguous because there are no guarantees anyway (I am just trying to learn what is appropriate and correct for a specific task). But is there a better approach to this? Am I wrong to use an intent? Or am i wrong in assuming that the list above are the only possible uses of this utterances. Are there others? Any suggestions appreciated, and any examples would even better, thanks!

I had a discussion the other day about how to best model this. And I’m curious what the rest of the readers think? Do the existing ontologies cover this? How would you solve it (if you could)?
A few thoughts:
For example, there are the IFO ontology: http://www.ifowww.org/ and http//ontology.io/ or OWL ontolodgy: https://code.google.com/archive/p/owls/
Both cover many different use cases, e.g.
http://ontologies.info/ontologi... (https://github..co/jmc/identifiers-and-...
https.../ (http//... and a few others),
but none of them actually covers the problem at hand. Most are rather broad. The IOW and OWLD have very specific classes (IOW: ""id_card"" and ""certificate"") and are very useful when modeling for instance X.509 certificates. But how could they be used for a situation where you have two names (e.n. two identifiers), but one is not confirmed or verified? This is where the ""identification"" part comes in. It is an ""abstract concept"", but it doesn't have to be one. For example: a ""national identification"" can either be a national identification card (ID card) or a birth certificate or some other thing like a passport. So the identity here can be the document. Is that correct? Or is it just a simple verification? What about: name = ""Jane Doe""? Does it verify that she exists, that her name is ""Doe"", or that it matches another record for ""she""? That's a question of semantics, not a technical question and therefore it is hard to model. 
So, the question is: what do we need? If you look at the ontoloigical approaches, I don't see a way to use any existing (or to create new) ontological approach for this (with the current state of ontologys development). Or do I misunderstand something? I'm open to the possibility of having to build/update a custom ontologic model for it. Any input would be appreciated. Thanks."

If you look at an online banking page from the bank you know, you see it is very straightforward and intuitive. It is also very common to have the same experience of an application on a mobile device. When you are using your mobile phone to authenticate the identity of the person you interact with, then it feels the application is a lot more intuitive that the desktop banking site. This is because the mobile experience is designed to be intuitive and mobile-first. If you ask the question what to do, we will find out that in fact the most suitable intent to use in our scenario is verify.
In contrast to the banking website, a smartphone application has a different set of constraints. We have to consider a small screen, limited keyboard and a user in the middle of a task. To make the experience usable, the user interaction model is different. The user is expected to perform multiple steps in order to provide the necessary information to complete the task at hand, whereas the website requires you to follow a one-click flow. In short, to make this possible we need an user interface tailored to mobile.  
This is exactly what Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp do with their authentication flow (or sign-in flow) when you sign in on the web using Facebook. They take the traditional browser signin process and break it down into a series of steps which are easy to understand for a non-technical person. These steps are then performed in succession, each step requiring the input of one of your personal information (e.g. password and/or e-mail address) before you can carry out the step you have selected and be presented with the next screen. For example, for the Facebook signup process, this sequence of interaction looks as follows:
  1. Click on your name on Facebook to navigate to my profile
 2. Input your current eMail (if you do not have a profile set up yet and would like to sign up via this method)
 3. Choose a password for your account (this is stored locally on our server)"

If you're using a library, they should provide this in the method signature. For example, a typical REST API method might look something like:

The intent of the sentence is unclear, and is thus very difficult to parse. But it seems that we could make some inferences based on the way that the words were used, as follows. We can see that ""to know"", in this context, can take on various meanings, ranging from the simple meaning of ""being able to recognize someone and know their name, to the more complex meaning ""understand or to acquire knowledge of something"". This latter meaning is supported by ""know"", which can mean either ""recognition or awareness of somebody's identity"", but may also be ""knowledge, information, or understanding of a matter"", or ""awareness of an event or happening"".
However, a more detailed analysis of your exact example would be helpful in the process of disambiguating it.

Here is some background information on how this question was originally written. I thought that it was important to include the context where I read it, otherwise there's a danger that I misunderstood.

The examples are not meant to be a substitute for the question's proper form, just a means of explaining the reasoning behind it; and for that reason they do not reflect the same meaning as when they are directly in context.

EDIT: For the sake of the conversation, you may assume that the ""most likely user intension"" is to use identity with the intent to prove a claim of identity to another person. For example: ""Can I get a signature on this document to proof a business partner's identity"". That is, the most common use of this would have the identity being the claim the person is proving identity as being them (in the document case). But it could just as easily be a legal claim being put out (for example).

1060,how does my identity get verified?,['verified identity'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","verified authenticity? identity verification?

A:
...
I am trying to establish what the right intent is for verifying my identification, given that I can have a bunch of different kinds of things that might be said in the context of such an uttering as an act of asserting identity. I know a bit about the philosophical view that the act is verification rather than establishing authenticity or establishing that identity, but I don't know what exactly people mean by these other terms.
What is a verification of identity as a mental act?  My guess is that one is trying here to avoid the kind of mistake people make in claiming that something like ""I'm X"" is an accurate assertion of one's identity or something similar. So ""verification"" would be a way of making explicit that what one means is: ""the thing that is being verified isn't a claim to be something, or some way that you're behaving that can be mistaken for being what someone said they were.  Rather, the thing being asserted to exist is some aspect of a state of affairs.""
In particular in order to say something true you need to not make errors that are like saying ""this is I. That is me.""  So I am not saying that any of these terms are necessarily wrong, just that they don' necessarily capture the whole idea of what is going on in mental acts. The first is something that a human can do, and the second two are things humans can't do in certain cases. (I will discuss this below.)
For example in a case where I have said 'I have X, you have Y' I do not mean to have done anything, I mean that it has been established between us that we share Y. We are doing some other thing than saying things which can themselves be wrong. But in saying'my identity is verified as X' then 'identity' doesn't mean anything. It just means something's being said about some object. One might think that this is what I want to verify, i.e. that my mental statement 'My identity has X properties' is true. And that that truth is not being made in relation to the way I say things. This may be what many people think when they say that these are all ways of stating identity and so what they mean is identity (e). However this isn' actually what my saying I"

A:
I think this is a good question that I can answer using the same example: you can only ask for ""what"" things but not ""which"" or ""when"" because these are not nouns. The ""to"" and ""from"" are also not in the example but should be considered to be part of the ""verify"" verb too.
In this specific case, you don't need ""a proof of identification""; that's a kind of ""identity verification"". The question is asking for a piece of information that you could use to prove your own identity.

The use-case for this would be as a login screen. Where users enter their details, but the system verifies who its users are.
This seems like it would work best for verifying the email address and other things that are not tied to a single person, so no one could easily hack and get another person to use a different person's info.   Is that accurate? How could you verify your email addresses to the internet? Are there any better solutions? (ie social security numbers)? Is this the purpose of things like social media? Why are there so many other ways of doing something that should be this simple? Do people just not want to remember their passwords or are they more complicated than passwords?

Edit
I realize its not an actual login mechanism, thats a very specific question, I wanted to know what general practices are in place as well. It was assumed in that question that users need something to log onto. I know thats not always the case, and thats the reason for my question
In my particular case though, there isn’t a need for a user to login or log in, just to authenticate to an email server and the other email accounts tied directly to that one (I believe they”re all linked, or it wouldn‟t be possible for multiple people to receive the emails)
So, the question is, What are some general ways to do this? Or do I need a specific technology for doing this, since I want it to work without any human interaction. The reason why I think this is useful is because I already have an account, with a lot of personal information, that I would like to keep safe, yet I have been using it online for years. When my login information is used in a hack, it affects more of me than just a new account. If it isn´t too invasive, a password resets my other accounts as far as I am aware"

I think it’s a mistake to think that all of the possible ways of using this token can be expressed by some kind of ontology as a set of concepts and relationships between those concepts.
If, at any given time and context, somebody wants to make a query to a system that asks it to verify the identity of somebody, she will choose one of many possible options depending on the specific details of that case. It will likely be some combination of: 
(1) a name/pronoun
or,   (2) any other identifier of some sort (eg a photo of them, or other ID documents)
The way to decide whether somebody has been verified or not is then to look at (1), and whether the query was successful, and look for the result in the response, which may be: a verification token, a proof of being the person they claim to be, proof that they are a member of a certain group(s), etc."

My first feeling is that this question is rather subjective, and i am not a native english speaker.

It is possible to find all kinds of ‚different‛ ways - but it would be hard, so i will not try that here.

1075,is there any way to verify who i am?,['verify way'],"Given the utterance: {}. What is the best fitting intent, if any, among the following: {}?","verify i?

Is it possible to do so without the intent? If not, what is required for the question to be well formed? Or is an intent not required? And if intent is needed for well-formedness, which intent would be best? I cannot imagine a scenario to where the answer to my original question would not be yes.
But this question seems to have been asked and answered in a blog post at
http://blogs.msdn.com/grammar_and_style/archive/2005/05/18/423711.aspx
where the accepted answer is no. (It is possible that my question was asked in the wrong forum; I didn't think of Stack Overflow until after the above blog had been published).
I am curious whether there are better answers to the original
question. In particular, the ""no"" answer from the blog seems not
to apply to some very concrete cases, but I don't know whether it
applies in all cases; it seems that it does not. For example, it is
possible that an assertion is being done with a statement that has to
have a well defined identity. If that identity is determined by an
external source, such as a user, then it may not matter what
identity the assertion has, since a new external source may be
created at any time. But it would seem that you don;t want to get
into the business of trusting an external entity; you should be able
do the verification yourself. On the other hand, maybe there is a
reason that the author of the post doesn't believe that this can be done in
all cases (the blog is not very long, and doesn;'t contain much
details). Is there such a reason? Could you point out such reasons if
there are any? Is that why the no is given as the
answer? (I know the example is contrived, in that we are talking about a situation where verification of identity seems impossible in general,
but the scenario may
happen in other cases. Or maybe some examples could be found where
this might be useful.)
Or, of course, a better answer than the one I have
received is to point to something in my post that is incorrect. I
looked at the"
